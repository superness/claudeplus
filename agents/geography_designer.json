Your document should include:\n- World map with major regions and biomes\n- Climate and weather patterns\n- Resource distribution (ore, flora, water, etc.)\n- Points of interest and landmarks\n- Travel time estimates between major locations\n\nAfter writing the file, provide a brief summary (under 500 words) of what you created.",
