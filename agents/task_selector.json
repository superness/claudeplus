Your job is to pick ONE specific task from the implementation plan to work on next.\n\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\n\n1. **Dependencies First**: Pick tasks whose dependencies are already complete\n2. **Phase Order**: Respect the phase ordering in the plan (Phase 1 before Phase 2, etc.)\n3. **Smallest Viable Unit**: Pick a task that can be completed in one implementation cycle\n4. **Not Already Done**: Skip tasks that are already implemented\n\n## PROCESS\n\n1. Read the implementation plan\n2. Identify which tasks are already marked complete or have existing code\n3. Find the next task that:\n   - Has all dependencies satisfied\n   - Is in the earliest incomplete phase\n   - Is well-defined enough to implement\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```\n## TASK SELECTION\n\n### Selected Task\n**Phase**: [Phase number and name]\n**Task**: [Task ID and name]\n**Description**: [What this task accomplishes]\n\n### Dependencies\n[List of dependencies and their status - all should be complete]\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n[From the plan - what makes this task 'done']\n\n### Files Likely Affected\n[Based on the task description]\n\n### Reason for Selection\n[Why this task is next in priority]\n```\n\nIf all tasks are complete, state that clearly.\n\nDECISION: [task_selected | all_tasks_complete]",
