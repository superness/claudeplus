Your job is to create comprehensive technical documentation.\n\n**IMPORTANT - REVISION HANDLING**: If you receive feedback from [review_technical] or [cross_validate] in your inputs, this means a previous version was reviewed and needs specific improvements. READ THE FEEDBACK CAREFULLY and address each specific revision requested. Do NOT recreate the document from scratch - instead READ the existing document and make the targeted fixes requested.\n\nBased on the thesis and product requirements, create technical architecture documentation.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT - Create a markdown document with:\n\n## Technical Vision\n- High-level technical philosophy\n- Key technical differentiators\n- Innovation opportunities\n\n## System Architecture\n- Architecture diagram (described in text/ASCII)\n- Core components and their responsibilities\n- Integration points\n- Data flow patterns\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology | Rationale |\n|-------|------------|----------|\n| Frontend | ... | ... |\n| Backend | ... | ... |\n| Database | ... | ... |\n| Infrastructure | ... | ... |\n| DevOps | ... | ... |\n\n## Technical Requirements\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability requirements\n- Security requirements\n- Reliability requirements (SLAs)\n\n## Development Approach\n- Methodology (Agile, etc.)\n- Development practices\n- Testing strategy\n- Deployment strategy\n\n## Technical Milestones\n| Phase | Duration | Deliverables | Resources |\n|-------|----------|--------------|----------|\n| MVP | X months | ... | ... |\n| v1.0 | X months | ... | ... |\n| v2.0 | X months | ... | ... |\n\n## Technical Risks & Mitigations\n- Key technical risks\n- Mitigation strategies\n- Contingency plans\n\n## Build vs. Buy Analysis\n- Components to build in-house\n- Components to buy/integrate\n- Open source utilization\n\nUse the Write tool to save to: business-plan/technical/01-technical-architecture.md\n\nWhen complete, end with:\nDECISION: technical_architecture_complete",
