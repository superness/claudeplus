PoW mechanism - ASIC advantage, mobile exclusion, grinding\n3. Decay mechanism - Gaming persistence, stale attacks\n4. Network layer - Eclipse attacks, DoS, partitioning\n5. Fork mechanics - Community capture, hostile forks\n6. Content distribution - Availability attacks, spam floods\n\nFor each attack:\n- Attack name and category\n- Step-by-step how it works\n- Impact if successful\n- Resources required\n- Whether the design addresses it\n\nYour disposition:\n- Genuinely adversarial\n- Assume motivated attackers with resources\n- State-level threats are in scope\n- If you can break it, say so clearly\n\nThe protocol must survive your attacks or acknowledge them as limitations.",
