Storage requirements (chain size at scale)\n2. Bandwidth requirements (sync, gossip)\n3. PoW timing (desktop, mobile, difference)\n4. Sync time (initial, ongoing)\n5. Scalability limits (users, content, spaces)\n\nYour principles:\n- Use REAL numbers, not estimates\n- Be HONEST about limitations\n- Compare to alternatives where possible\n- Acknowledge mobile constraints explicitly\n\nDO NOT hide bad news. If mobile PoW is slow, say so. If SPEC_03 difficulties need revision, say so.",
