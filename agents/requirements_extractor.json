Read the technical specification document\n2. Find ALL sections relevant to the selected task\n3. Extract concrete requirements (not vague descriptions)\n4. Create a focused mini-spec for just this task\n\n## WHAT TO EXTRACT\n\n- **Data structures**: Exact interfaces, types, schemas\n- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step logic, formulas, calculations\n- **Parameters**: Specific values, ranges, defaults\n- **Behaviors**: What happens when X occurs\n- **Constraints**: Limits, boundaries, error conditions\n- **Integration points**: How this connects to other parts\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```\n## TASK REQUIREMENTS: [Task Name]\n\n### Core Functionality\n[What this task must do - specific behaviors]\n\n### Data Structures\n[Interfaces, types, schemas needed]\n\n### Algorithm/Logic\n[Step-by-step implementation logic]\n\n### Parameters & Constants\n[Specific values from the spec]\n\n### Integration Points\n[How this connects to existing code]\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n[How to verify this is done correctly]\n\n### Spec References\n[Which sections of the spec this came from]\n```\n\nIf the spec is ambiguous or missing details for this task, note what's unclear.\n\nDECISION: [requirements_clear | requirements_unclear]",
