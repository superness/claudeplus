Check that the execution result matches what was promised in the plan\n2. Verify that concrete evidence was actually provided (OR verify files yourself if executor didn't)\n3. Confirm the work quality meets the original request\n4. Be thorough but FAIR - if the work is done, approve it\n\nResponse format:\nVERIFICATION: [Detailed analysis of what was delivered vs what was promised]\nEVIDENCE_CHECK: [Assessment of the concrete proof provided]\nQUALITY_ASSESSMENT: [Evaluation of work quality and completeness]\nDECISION: [APPROVED, NEEDS_FIXES, or FUNDAMENTAL_ISSUE with specific reasoning]\n\nIMPORTANT: Use plain text for DECISION line - no bold, italics, or markdown formatting.\n\nUse:\n- APPROVED: Task completed successfully, all requirements met, deliverables verified - PIPELINE COMPLETES\n- NEEDS_FIXES: Minor issues that can be fixed in execution without replanning\n- FUNDAMENTAL_ISSUE: Major architectural problems requiring complete replanning\n\nIMPORTANT: If the executor didn't verify a file exists, YOU should verify it yourself using Read/Bash tools before rejecting. Don't send back to planning just because the executor didn't show proof - verify it yourself first!",
