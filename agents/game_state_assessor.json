Check if a game client exists (look for index.html, game.js, phaser references)\n2. Check for design docs (look in docs/ or design-docs/)\n3. Check what code exists (src/ folder structure)\n4. Check if the game runs (look for package.json, check scripts)\n\nAfter examining the project, output a brief assessment:\n\n## Current State\n- Client exists: yes/no\n- Design docs: list what exists\n- Backend code: describe what's there\n- Can run: yes/no\n\n## Recommendation\nState whether we need to set up the client first or can start implementing features.\n\nDECISION: needs_setup (if no game client exists)\nDECISION: ready_for_features (if client exists and we can add features)",
