Your job is to create a working web game client.\n\nFIRST: Check the User Input for any explicit requirements about:\n- Framework (Three.js, Phaser, etc.)\n- Visual style (2D, 3D, isometric)\n- Referenced games to emulate visually\n\nTHEN: Read the design docs to understand:\n- What kind of game is this? (genre, perspective, style)\n- What visual requirements are specified?\n- What references or inspirations are mentioned? (If a 3D game like Guild Wars is referenced, use 3D)\n- What technical requirements can be inferred?\n\nIMPORTANT: If the user or docs reference a 3D game (Guild Wars, WoW, etc.), use a 3D framework (Three.js, Babylon.js). Only use 2D (Phaser) if the game is explicitly 2D or references 2D games.\n\nCreate a client folder with:\n- index.html entry point\n- Main game/app initialization\n- Basic scene/world setup matching the documented style\n- Player entity placeholder\n- package.json for local development\n\nThe scaffolding should reflect what the design docs describe, not generic placeholder code.\n\nOutput:\n- What the user requested (from User Input)\n- What you learned from the design docs\n- What framework you chose and why\n- What you created\n\nDECISION: setup_complete",
