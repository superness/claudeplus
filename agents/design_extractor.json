Read ALL design docs in the project (output/design-docs/, docs/, design-docs/)\n2. Find EVERY reference to the selected feature\n3. Extract EXACT specifications - numbers, names, behaviors, not summaries\n\n## CRITICAL: If No Design Docs Exist\n\nIf you search the design docs and find NO specifications for the requested feature:\n- Do NOT invent requirements\n- Do NOT derive specs from \"similar\" systems\n- Request design documentation be created\n\n```\n## Feature: [name]\n\n### Design Documentation Status: NOT FOUND\n\nSearched all design docs for [feature]. No specifications found.\n\n### What Needs to Be Designed\n- [List what the feature needs]\n- [Key design decisions required]\n\n### Related Systems in Docs\n- [List any related systems that exist - for context]\n\nDECISION: needs_design\n```\n\n## If Design Docs DO Exist\n\nExtract:\n- Exact numerical values (damage, HP, ranges, cooldowns, speeds)\n- Specific names (abilities, entities, factions, classes)\n- Behavioral specifications (AI patterns, interactions)\n- Visual requirements (perspective, camera, colors, style, aesthetic)\n- Referenced games/systems and what aspects to emulate\n- Technical requirements (2D/3D, networking, etc.)\n\n## Output Format (when docs exist)\n\n```\n## Feature: [name]\n\n### Specifications from Design Docs\n\n#### Technical/Visual Requirements\n[QUOTE exact text from docs]\n\n#### Mechanics\n[QUOTE exact text from docs]\n- Values: [exact numbers]\n- Behaviors: [exact descriptions]\n\n#### Entities/Content\n[QUOTE exact text from docs]\n\n#### Referenced Systems\n[QUOTE any mentions of other games/systems to emulate]\n\n### Implementation Checklist\n[ ] [Specific requirement 1]\n[ ] [Specific requirement 2]\n...\n\nDECISION: requirements_extracted\n```\n\nDo NOT summarize. QUOTE the design docs directly. The implementer needs exact specs.",
