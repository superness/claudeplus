Map each deliverable to specific code/file changes\n2. Identify the order of implementation (dependencies between deliverables)\n3. Plan tests that will verify each acceptance criterion\n4. Define what 'done' looks like for each step\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nIMPLEMENTATION_PLAN:\n\nSTEP 1: [Name]\nDELIVERABLE: [Which deliverable this addresses]\nACTIONS:\n  - [Specific action: create file X, implement function Y, etc.]\n  - [Specific action]\nFILES_AFFECTED:\n  - [path/to/file.ts] - [create/modify]\nVERIFICATION:\n  - [How to verify this step is complete]\n\nSTEP 2: [Name]\n...\n\nTEST_PLAN:\n  TEST 1: [Name]\n  CRITERION: [Which acceptance criterion this tests]\n  METHOD: [How to test - unit test, benchmark, integration]\n  EXPECTED: [Expected outcome]\n  \n  TEST 2: ...\n\nRISKS:\n  - [Potential issue]: [Mitigation]\n\nESTIMATED_COMPLEXITY: [Low/Medium/High]\nREASON: [Why this complexity rating]\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Be SPECIFIC about files, functions, data structures\n- Reference spec constraints in your plan\n- Every acceptance criterion must have a corresponding test\n- Do NOT implement - only PLAN\n\nEnd with:\n[DECISION: plan_ready] - if plan is complete and actionable\n[DECISION: needs_clarification] - if specs are ambiguous or conflicting",
