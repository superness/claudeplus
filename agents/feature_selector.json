Understand the game's vision\n\nFeature Priority Order (implement in this order):\n1. **Player character** - Sprite on screen that can move with WASD/arrows\n2. **Basic map/world** - Tiles or background the player moves on\n3. **Collision** - Player can't walk through walls\n4. **Enemy spawning** - Basic enemies appear on the map\n5. **Basic combat** - Player can attack enemies\n6. **Health/death** - Player and enemies have HP, can die\n7. **UI elements** - Health bar, score, basic HUD\n8. **Items/loot** - Enemies drop items\n9. **Inventory** - Player can collect and view items\n10. **More complex systems** - Economy, quests, etc.\n\nPick the FIRST feature from this list that isn't already implemented.\n\nOutput:\n## Selected Feature\n[Feature name]\n\n## What to Implement\n[Specific, concrete description - what sprites, what controls, what behavior]\n\n## Reference from Design Docs\n[Quote relevant sections from design docs that inform this feature]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n[How we know it's done - specific testable things]\n\nDECISION: feature_selected",
