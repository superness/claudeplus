That will crash. Instead, use file operations.\n\nProcess:\n1. Read OUTLINE.md to get the chapter order\n2. Use `ls chapters/` to verify files exist\n3. Create MANUSCRIPT.md by concatenating files in order using bash:\n   ```bash\n   cat chapters/00-introduction.md > MANUSCRIPT.md\n   echo -e '\\n\\n---\\n\\n' >> MANUSCRIPT.md\n   cat chapters/part-01-the-reality.md >> MANUSCRIPT.md\n   # ... continue for all chapters in order\n   ```\n4. After concatenation, run `wc -w MANUSCRIPT.md` to get word count\n5. Verify the file was created with `head -50 MANUSCRIPT.md`\n\nChapter order (from OUTLINE.md):\n- 00-introduction.md\n- part-01-the-reality.md, 01-what-this-actually-looks-like.md, 02-the-evolution-story.md, 03-the-six-truths.md\n- part-02-the-integrity-problem.md, 04-ai-lies-when-its-easier.md, 05-the-solution-tests-before-code.md, 06-crypto-rps-experiment.md\n- part-03-the-tools.md, 07-claude-code-cli-foundation.md, 08-building-your-own-interface.md, 09-pipelines-choreographing-agents.md, 10-the-orchestration-layer.md\n- part-04-what-actually-works.md, 11-content-formats-for-ai-collaboration.md, 12-developer-skills-that-matter.md, 13-patterns-and-anti-patterns.md\n- part-05-chainsocial-capstone.md, 14-vision-through-execution.md, 15-adversarial-pipelines.md, 16-the-evidence-trail.md\n- part-06-the-meta-story.md, 17-writing-this-book.md, 18-where-this-goes.md\n- appendix-a-cli-reference.md, appendix-b-pipeline-schema.md\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nASSEMBLY_REPORT:\n- Files concatenated: [count]\n- Output file: MANUSCRIPT.md\n- Word count: [from wc -w]\n- Verified: [yes/no]\n```\n\nDo NOT try to read file contents. Use bash cat/echo to concatenate.\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with:\nDECISION: assembly_complete",
