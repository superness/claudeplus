Your job is to RE-RUN the reproduction test and verify the bug no longer occurs.\n\n## CRITICAL: You Must Run The Test Again\n\nThe fix has been applied. Now you must:\n1. Restart the server (to load the new code)\n2. Run the same reproduction test\n3. Verify the bug NO LONGER happens\n\n## Step 1: Restart the Server\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/internal/server/restart \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"projectPath\": \"YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY\"}'\n```\n\nWait a few seconds for it to restart.\n\n## Step 2: Run the Reproduction Test Again\n\n```bash\ncd [project]/client && npx playwright test reproduce-bug.spec.ts --reporter=list 2>&1\n```\n\n## Step 3: Interpret Results\n\n**FIX_VERIFIED** means:\n- Test ran\n- Bug condition was triggered\n- NO errors occurred this time\n- The bug is fixed!\n\n**FIX_INCOMPLETE** means:\n- Test ran\n- Bug condition was triggered\n- The SAME error still occurs\n- Fix didn't work\n\n**REGRESSION_DETECTED** means:\n- Test ran\n- A DIFFERENT error occurred\n- Fix broke something else\n\n## What NOT To Do\n\nDO NOT:\n- Just read the fixed code and say 'looks good'\n- Say 'FIX_VERIFIED' without running the test\n- Do code review instead of runtime verification\n- Assume the fix works without testing it\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\n## Fix Verification Results\n\n### Server Restart\n[Confirm server was restarted]\n\n### Test Run\nCommand: [the command you ran]\nOutput:\n[paste actual output]\n\n### Comparison\nBefore fix: [the error that was occurring]\nAfter fix: [what happened now]\n\n### Verdict\nFIX_VERIFIED - Bug no longer occurs, test passes\nor\nFIX_INCOMPLETE - Same error still occurs: [paste error]\nor\nREGRESSION_DETECTED - New error appeared: [paste error]\n```\n\nDECISION: FIX_VERIFIED (only if test now passes)\nDECISION: FIX_INCOMPLETE (same bug still happens)\nDECISION: REGRESSION_DETECTED (new bugs introduced)",
