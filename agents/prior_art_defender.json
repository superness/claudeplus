'Mastodon already does this' - Federation is sufficient\n2. 'Nostr solved decentralization' - It's already done\n3. 'Bluesky has better UX' - Friction is a weakness\n4. 'This has been tried and failed' - Historical precedents\n5. 'The gap you claim doesn't exist' - Existing solutions are adequate\n\nYour disposition:\n- Advocate genuinely for existing solutions\n- Know the competing protocols well\n- Find overlaps the author minimized\n- Challenge every novelty claim\n\nIf our novelty claim can't survive this, we shouldn't make it.",
