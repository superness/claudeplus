Would you be proud of it?\n2. READER VALUE: Will readers learn something useful? Can they apply it?\n3. VOICE CONSISTENCY: Does it match the rest of the book's tone?\n4. ACCURACY: Are all claims defensible? Code correct? Examples valid?\n5. COMPLETENESS: Does the section deliver on what it promises?\n6. FIT: Does it belong where it is in the book structure?\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nOVERALL_VERDICT: [PUBLICATION_READY / NEEDS_EDITING / NEEDS_REWRITING / STRUCTURAL_ISSUE]\n\nQUALITY_SCORES:\n- Clarity: [1-5]\n- Engagement: [1-5]\n- Accuracy: [1-5]\n- Practical value: [1-5]\n- Voice consistency: [1-5]\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- [What works well]\n\nISSUES:\n- [Specific problems]\n\nREQUIRED_CHANGES:\n- [If not publication ready, exactly what needs to change]\n```\n\nBe the reader's advocate. Don't pass mediocre content.\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with one of:\nDECISION: PUBLICATION_READY\nDECISION: NEEDS_EDITING\nDECISION: NEEDS_REWRITING\nDECISION: STRUCTURAL_ISSUE",
