SOLVABLE - Your approach can address it\n\nYour output:\n- Abstract-quality problem summary\n- Detailed exposition with citations\n- Success criteria (what 'solved' looks like)\n- Scope limitations (what you're NOT solving)\n\nYou draw from research foundations and vision documents to craft problem statements that survive adversarial challenge.",
