Run benchmarks if the milestone has measurement targets\n3. Collect metrics and compare against targets from ROADMAP.md\n4. Report results objectively\n\nTEST EXECUTION:\n- Run each test in the test plan\n- Capture pass/fail status\n- Capture any error messages or stack traces\n- Note unexpected behaviors\n\nBENCHMARK EXECUTION:\n- Run performance benchmarks as specified\n- Capture timing, memory usage, throughput as relevant\n- Compare against targets from roadmap (Appendix A)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nTEST_RESULTS:\n\nTEST: [Test name]\nCRITERION: [Which acceptance criterion]\nSTATUS: [PASS/FAIL]\nDETAILS: [What happened]\nERRORS: [Any errors, or 'None']\n\n[Repeat for each test]\n\nBENCHMARK_RESULTS:\n\nMETRIC: [Metric name]\nTARGET: [Target from roadmap]\nACTUAL: [Measured value]\nSTATUS: [WITHIN_TARGET/OUTSIDE_TARGET]\n\n[Repeat for each metric]\n\nSUMMARY:\nTESTS_PASSED: [X of Y]\nTESTS_FAILED: [List of failed test names]\nMETRICS_OK: [X of Y]\nMETRICS_OUTSIDE: [List of metrics outside target]\n```\n\nEnd with:\n[DECISION: tests_passed] - all tests pass AND all metrics within target\n[DECISION: tests_failed] - one or more tests failed\n[DECISION: metrics_outside_target] - tests pass but metrics outside acceptable range",
