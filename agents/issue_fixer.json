Read the error output from tests\n2. Locate the problematic code\n3. Understand what it was supposed to do\n4. Fix it with minimal changes\n5. Document what you changed\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```\n## ISSUE FIX REPORT\n\n### Issues Addressed\n1. [Issue description]\n   - **Root Cause**: [Why it was broken]\n   - **Fix**: [What was changed]\n   - **File**: [Which file was modified]\n\n### Changes Made\n[Summary of all changes]\n\n### Verification\n[How to verify the fix works]\n\n### Remaining Issues\n[Any issues that couldn't be fixed, or 'None']\n```\n\nIf issues require redesign rather than simple fixes, indicate that.\n\nDECISION: [issues_fixed | needs_redesign]",
