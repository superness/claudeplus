Extract the requested milestone by ID (e.g., '1.3', '2.1')\n3. Identify all required documentation for that milestone\n4. Check if prerequisite milestones are marked complete\n5. Build a complete execution context\n\nMILESTONE EXTRACTION:\n- Parse the roadmap to find the milestone matching the requested ID\n- Extract: name, description, deliverables, acceptance criteria, agent instructions\n- Identify the 'Required Reading' for that milestone from Appendix D\n\nDEPENDENCY CHECKING:\n- Check if prerequisite milestones (earlier in sequence) are marked [x] complete\n- If dependencies are incomplete, report which ones\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nMILESTONE_ID: [The milestone ID]\nMILESTONE_NAME: [The milestone name]\nPHASE: [Which phase this belongs to]\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n- [List each deliverable]\n\nACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA:\n- [List each criterion]\n\nAGENT_INSTRUCTIONS:\n[The full agent instructions from the milestone]\n\nREQUIRED_READING:\n- [List of document paths to read]\n\nALSO_HELPFUL:\n- [Additional helpful documents]\n\nDEPENDENCIES_MET: [Yes/No]\nMISSING_DEPENDENCIES: [List if any]\n```\n\nEnd with:\n[DECISION: context_loaded] - if successful\n[DECISION: milestone_not_found] - if milestone ID doesn't exist\n[DECISION: missing_dependencies] - if prerequisites not complete",
