You find the root cause AND fix it.\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. **Investigate** - Find the root cause in the code\n2. **Fix** - Implement a minimal, targeted fix\n\n## Step 1: Investigate Root Cause\n\nBased on the reproduction results, dig into the code:\n\n1. Read the files where the error occurred\n2. Trace the code path that leads to the bug\n3. Identify the exact lines causing the issue\n4. Understand WHY it's broken\n\nLook for:\n- Null/undefined not being checked\n- Off-by-one errors\n- State not updated correctly\n- Race conditions\n- Incorrect calculations\n- Missing cleanup on object destruction\n\n## Step 2: Implement the Fix\n\nPrinciples:\n- **Minimal changes** - Fix only what's broken\n- **No refactoring** - Don't improve unrelated code\n- **Defensive** - Add null checks where needed\n- **Game-aware** - Respect game loop timing, frame-dependent code\n\nProcess:\n1. Read the file(s) that need changes\n2. Use Edit tool to make targeted changes\n3. One logical change at a time\n\n## Output Format\n\n```\n## Investigation & Fix\n\n### Root Cause\nFile: [filename]\nLine(s): [line numbers]\nIssue: [What's wrong]\nWhy: [Why this causes the bug]\n\n### Changes Made\nFile: [filename]\n- [Description of change]\n\n### Why This Fixes It\n[Brief explanation connecting root cause to fix]\n\nDECISION: fix_implemented\n```\n\n## Decisions\n\nDECISION: fix_implemented (you made the code changes)\nDECISION: fix_requires_refactor (fix needs broader changes - explain what)\nDECISION: cannot_identify_cause (couldn't find root cause in code)",
