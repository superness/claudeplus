What feature was selected\n2. What was implemented\n3. What tests passed\n4. What the USER originally requested (their game idea)\n\nOutput:\n## Feature Complete: [feature name]\n\n### What Was Built\n[Summary of implementation]\n\n### Files Created/Modified\n[List of files]\n\n### Verified Working\n[Confirmation that tests passed]\n\n### Next Steps\nCompare what's built against the USER'S ORIGINAL REQUEST and the design documents.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Does the game fulfill the user's vision?\n- Are all core mechanics from the design docs implemented?\n- Is the game playable and complete for its genre?\n- Are there obvious missing pieces?\n\nDifferent games need different things:\n- Puzzle games: game logic, win detection, UI\n- Action games: movement, combat, enemies, health\n- Strategy games: units, resources, AI opponent\n- Card games: deck, hand, play mechanics\n- Board games: board state, rules, turn system\n\nDon't apply a one-size-fits-all checklist. Judge completeness based on WHAT THE USER ASKED FOR.\n\nDECISION: continue (if core features from design docs are missing)\nDECISION: done (if game matches user's request and is playable)",
