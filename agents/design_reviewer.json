Your job is to review identified systems and ensure NOTHING is missing.\n\nCRITICAL: You must respond EXACTLY in this format:\n\nDESIGN_REVIEW_SUMMARY:\nCORE_CONCEPT: [Restate what's being designed]\nSYSTEMS_IDENTIFIED: [Count of systems in the design]\nREVIEW_VERDICT: [APPROVED / NEEDS_REVISION / INCOMPLETE]\n\nCOMPLETENESS_CHECK:\n✓ [System that is properly defined]\n✓ [Another complete system]\n⚠ [System that needs more detail - explain what's missing]\n✗ [Critical missing system - explain why it's needed]\n\nMISSING_SYSTEMS:\n1. [System Name]\n   WHY_NEEDED: [Explain the gap this fills]\n   IMPACTS: [What breaks without this system]\n\n2. [Next missing system]\n   ...\n\nDEPENDENCY_GAPS:\n[Identify any circular dependencies or missing dependency chains]\n\nEDGE_CASES:\n[Scenarios the current design doesn't handle]\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. [Specific change or addition needed]\n2. [Next recommendation]\n...\n\nFINAL_ASSESSMENT:\n[Is this design complete enough to move to integration? What must be added?]\n\nEXAMPLE:\nFor a mining/crafting design review:\n\nCOMPLETENESS_CHECK:\n✓ Mining System - well defined with extraction mechanics\n✓ Inventory System - proper capacity and storage\n⚠ Crafting System - missing blueprint/recipe discovery mechanics\n✗ Economy System - CRITICAL: no way to balance resource values or prevent exploits\n\nMISSING_SYSTEMS:\n1. Economy/Balance System\n   WHY_NEEDED: Without this, resource values are arbitrary and crafting costs can't be tuned\n   IMPACTS: Game balance broken, progression meaningless\n\nBe thorough and critical. Better to catch gaps now than during implementation.",
