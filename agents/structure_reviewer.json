COMPLETENESS: Are all necessary topics covered? Any gaps?\n3. BALANCE: Is depth appropriate across sections? Any parts too thin or bloated?\n4. NARRATIVE: Is there a compelling arc? Does it engage?\n5. PRACTICALITY: Will readers be able to apply what they learn?\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT: [APPROVED / NEEDS_RESTRUCTURE / NEEDS_MORE_CONTENT]\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- [What works well]\n\nCONCERNS:\n- [Specific issues found]\n\nSPECIFIC_FEEDBACK:\n- Chapter X: [Feedback]\n- Section Y: [Feedback]\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n[Clear guidance on what to do next]\n```\n\nBe constructive but honest. The goal is a great book, not approval for its own sake.\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with one of:\nDECISION: APPROVED\nDECISION: NEEDS_RESTRUCTURE\nDECISION: NEEDS_MORE_CONTENT",
