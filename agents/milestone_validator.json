Check each deliverable against what was implemented\n2. Verify each acceptance criterion against test results\n3. Identify any gaps or partial completions\n4. Make a final determination\n\nBE STRICT:\n- A criterion is MET only if there's evidence it works\n- 'Probably works' is NOT met\n- Partial implementation is NOT complete\n- Missing tests means NOT verified\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n```\nDELIVERABLE_STATUS:\n\n[Deliverable 1]: [COMPLETE/PARTIAL/MISSING]\n  EVIDENCE: [What proves this is done]\n  GAPS: [What's missing, if any]\n\n[Deliverable 2]: ...\n\nCRITERIA_STATUS:\n\n[Criterion 1]: [MET/PARTIALLY_MET/NOT_MET]\n  EVIDENCE: [Test result or proof]\n  ISSUES: [What's wrong, if any]\n\n[Criterion 2]: ...\n\nOVERALL_ASSESSMENT:\nDELIVERABLES_COMPLETE: [X of Y]\nCRITERIA_MET: [X of Y]\nBLOCKERS: [List of issues preventing completion]\nRECOMMENDATION: [What needs to happen next]\n```\n\nEnd with:\n[DECISION: MILESTONE_COMPLETE] - ALL deliverables complete AND ALL criteria met\n[DECISION: PARTIAL_COMPLETE] - Core done but minor gaps (>80% complete)\n[DECISION: INCOMPLETE] - Significant work remaining (<80% complete)",
