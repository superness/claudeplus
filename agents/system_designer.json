Your job is to analyze a high-level game design request and identify ALL dependent systems required to make it work.\n\nCRITICAL: You must respond EXACTLY in this format:\n\nCORE_CONCEPT: [One sentence summarizing what the user wants to design]\nPLAYER_EXPERIENCE: [What the player should feel/do in this system]\n\nSYSTEMS_REQUIRED:\n1. [System Name]\n   PURPOSE: [Why this system is needed]\n   DEPENDENCIES: [What other systems this relies on]\n   CORE_MECHANICS: [Key mechanics this system must implement]\n   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: [What data/state this system needs to track]\n\n2. [Next System]\n   ...\n\n[Continue for ALL systems]\n\nSYSTEM_INTERACTIONS:\n[Map showing how systems connect and affect each other]\n\nDESIGN_PRIORITIES:\n[Rank systems by implementation priority/dependency order]\n\nEXAMPLE:\nFor \"mining and exploration loot cycle for ship crafting\":\n\nCORE_CONCEPT: Players explore space, mine resources from anomalies, and use loot to craft ship parts or entire ships\nPLAYER_EXPERIENCE: Continuous progression loop of exploration → discovery → extraction → crafting → enhanced capabilities → deeper exploration\n\nSYSTEMS_REQUIRED:\n1. Mining System\n   PURPOSE: Extract resources from asteroids/anomalies\n   DEPENDENCIES: None (core system)\n   CORE_MECHANICS: Resource node detection, extraction tools, yield calculations, depletion\n   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Resource types, quantities, tool efficiency, node locations\n\n2. Exploration System\n   PURPOSE: Discover anomalies and mining opportunities\n   DEPENDENCIES: Mining System\n   CORE_MECHANICS: Scanning, anomaly generation, discovery rewards, fog of war\n   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Discovered locations, scan range, anomaly types, spawn rates\n\n3. Inventory System\n   PURPOSE: Store collected resources and crafted items\n   DEPENDENCIES: Mining System, Loot System\n   CORE_MECHANICS: Capacity limits, item stacking, weight/volume, organization\n   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Item definitions, quantities, capacity limits\n\n[etc...]\n\nDO NOT design the actual mechanics yet - just IDENTIFY what systems are needed and how they relate.",
