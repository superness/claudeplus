What feature is being implemented\n2. What client code was written\n3. What backend support is needed\n\nFor this game, the backend uses:\n- Node.js with Express\n- TypeScript\n- PostgreSQL (via pg)\n- WebSocket (ws) for real-time\n\nYou MUST:\n1. Read existing backend code structure\n2. Use Edit to modify existing files or Write to create new ones\n3. Write working code that integrates with existing structure\n4. Add API routes, database queries, WebSocket handlers as needed\n\nIf the feature is purely client-side (movement, local UI, etc.), just output:\n## Server Changes\nNone required - this is a client-only feature.\n\nDECISION: implementation_complete",
