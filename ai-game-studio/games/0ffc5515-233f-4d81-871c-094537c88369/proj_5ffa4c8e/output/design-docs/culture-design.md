**After Battle**:
- Victors do not mock the defeated
- The Cat's Game (draw) is celebrated by both as proof of eternal balance
- Both sides retreat to prepare for the next engagement

### 3.3 Trade and Exchange

While enemies, the forces acknowledge mutual dependence:

## 7. Summary

The cultures of Celestial Grid transform simple game pieces into representatives of cosmic civilizations with rich histories, values, and traditions. The Luminara bring warmth, harmony, and the drive to create, while the Voidborn bring power, transformation, and the acceptance of entropy. Their eternal conflict, governed by the neutral Arbiters, gives every match profound significance.

Both cultures respect the game as sacred - this is not mere competition, but the universe's way of maintaining balance. Every X placed is a claim of darkness advancing. Every O placed is light pushing back. And every draw is proof that the cosmos remains in equilibrium.

This cultural framework ensures players feel they're participating in something grand, even when playing the simplest possible game.
