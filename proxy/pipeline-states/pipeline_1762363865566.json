    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a professional showcase website for ClaudePlus AI Agent Automation tool to be deployed at www.superagentification.com. The site should demonstrate the tool's capabilities, include screenshots of templates, tool layout, and the engaging commentator progress reporting system from standalone-pipeline. The goal is to impress potential employers and secure interviews by highlighting AI Agent Automation expertise.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, explore the codebase to understand ClaudePlus architecture, features, and components\n2. Identify key visual assets and screenshot opportunities (templates, pipeline designer, progress reporting)\n3. Review the standalone-pipeline system and engaging commentator for progress reporting features\n4. Create a modern, professional single-page showcase website with sections for features, architecture, templates, and live screenshots\n5. Design the page with employer appeal in mind - focus on technical sophistication, automation capabilities, and innovation\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/CLAUDE.md` for system architecture understanding\n2) Use Glob tool to find all template files: `templates/*.json`\n3) Use Read tool to examine key templates (claude-plus-v1.json, game-design-v1.json, living-game-world-v1.json, thesis-generator-v1.json)\n4) Use Glob tool to find agent definitions: `agents/*.json`\n5) Use Read tool to examine `proxy/multi-agent-system.js` to understand orchestration layer\n6) Use Glob tool to find standalone-pipeline files: `**/standalone-pipeline*` or `**/commentator*`\n7) Use Read tool to examine pipeline designer files: `src/pipeline-designer.html` and `src/pipeline-designer.js`\n8) Use Read tool to examine main interfaces: `src/index.html`, `src/claude-app-web.html`\n9) Use Grep tool to search for \"commentator\" or \"progress\" to find engaging commentator system\n10) Use Glob tool to find existing screenshots in `mediaexamples/` directory\n11) Create HTML showcase page at `output/index.html` with:\n    - Hero section highlighting ClaudePlus capabilities\n    - Architecture diagram section (based on CLAUDE.md architecture)\n    - Template showcase section (with descriptions of 4 main templates)\n    - Agent system section (highlighting 38+ specialized agents)\n    - Screenshots gallery section (using images from mediaexamples or placeholders)\n    - Progress reporting/commentator section (showing real-time status updates)\n    - Technical highlights section (WebSocket, multi-agent orchestration, pipeline designer)\n12) Create accompanying CSS file for professional styling\n13) Include JavaScript for interactive elements (image galleries, section navigation)\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will verify all file paths and screenshots exist before referencing\n- Will ensure the page loads correctly with fallback content if screenshots are missing\n- Will test responsive design for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)\n- Will validate that technical details accurately reflect the codebase architecture\n- Will ensure the page highlights both technical depth and practical use cases\n- Will test that the page can be deployed as a static site (no server dependencies)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will provide the complete HTML/CSS/JS files for the showcase page\n- Will list all screenshots identified from mediaexamples directory\n- Will show accurate technical details extracted from CLAUDE.md, agents/*.json, and templates/*.json\n- Will demonstrate understanding of the multi-agent system, pipeline designer, and commentator features\n- Will provide a file tree showing the deliverable structure in output/\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - The codebase has comprehensive documentation (CLAUDE.md), structured agent/template systems, and existing UI components to reference. The task is well-defined with clear goals (impress employers, showcase automation capabilities). Will create a professional showcase that accurately represents the technical sophistication of ClaudePlus while being visually engaging.",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: This request LACKS a concrete execution plan and has CRITICAL gaps that prevent proper evaluation:\n\n**UNDERSTANDING ISSUES:**\n1. **No Plan Submitted** - This is a direct user request, NOT a plan from a task_planner agent to review\n2. **Vague Deliverable** - \"showcase page\" is ambiguous - is this a static HTML page, a React app, a documentation site, or integration into an existing platform?\n3. **Unclear Deployment** - Mentions www.superagentification.com but no details on hosting infrastructure, deployment method, or domain setup\n4. **Missing Technical Specs** - No framework choice, no responsive design requirements, no performance criteria\n5. **Undefined Success Criteria** - \"knock their socks off\" is subjective, not measurable\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY ISSUES:**\nThe request mentions showcasing:\n- Screenshots of templates ✓ (Available: 8 templates in /templates/)\n- Full tool layout ✓ (Available: pipeline designer UI screenshots)\n- Progress reporting from commentator ✓ (Available: commentator system with styled messages)\n\nHowever, there's NO PLAN describing:\n- How screenshots will be captured (manual vs automated)\n- What specific pipeline executions will be demonstrated\n- How the showcase will be structured (sections, navigation, storytelling)\n- What \"understanding the tool\" means concretely (documentation? video? interactive demo?)\n- How this will be tested before deployment\n- How success will be measured (specific metrics that prove it \"knocks socks off\")\n\n**ARCHITECTURAL UNDERSTANDING:**\nThe claudeplus tool is a sophisticated multi-agent AI automation system with:\n- **3-tier architecture**: Windows Electron App → WebSocket (port 8081) → WSL Proxy Server → Claude Code Processes\n- **38+ specialized agents** organized by domain (game design, system design, validation, analysis, testing)\n- **Visual pipeline designer** with drag-and-drop interface for building custom agent workflows\n- **8 pre-built templates** (claude-plus-v1, game-design-v1, living-game-world-v1, thesis-generator-v1, business-builder-v1, cerebro-meta-pipeline-v1, full-stack-enterprise-v1, test-automation-v1)\n- **Engaging commentator system** that provides real-time styled commentary during pipeline execution (EXCITED, FOCUSED, CONCERNED, TRIUMPHANT, CRITICAL styles)\n- **Advanced features**: circuit breaker patterns, process pooling, pipeline state management, checkpoint/resume, adaptive timeouts\n\nThis is EXCELLENT material for a showcase - but without a structured plan, I cannot evaluate execution quality.\n\n**WHAT A PROPER PLAN WOULD NEED:**\n1. **Technology Stack Decision**: Static HTML/CSS/JS vs React vs Next.js vs other\n2. **Content Strategy**: Hero section, feature highlights, live demos, architecture diagrams, testimonials\n3. **Screenshot Capture Plan**: Which pipelines to execute, what stages to capture, how to annotate\n4. **Deployment Steps**: Domain configuration, hosting setup (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages), CI/CD if applicable\n5. **Success Metrics**: Load time < 2s, mobile-responsive, accessibility score > 90, specific employer engagement metrics\n6. **Evidence Collection**: Screenshots of deployed site, Lighthouse scores, accessibility audit, cross-browser testing results\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **INSUFFICIENT** - No plan exists to evaluate. The user request itself has good source material (screenshots available, system well-documented), but there's no structured approach to turning this into a deliverable.\n\nDECISION: **REJECTED** \n\n**REASONING:**\nI am a DISCERNING EXPERT reviewing task plans from a task_planner agent. This is NOT a plan - it's the original user request. \n\n**THE PROPER WORKFLOW SHOULD BE:**\n1. **User Request** → (This message)\n2. **Task Planner** → Creates detailed plan with UNDERSTANDING, APPROACH, STEPS, TEST_CONSIDERATIONS, EVIDENCE, CONFIDENCE\n3. **Discerning Expert (me)** → Reviews that plan with extreme scrutiny\n4. **Task Executor** → Executes approved plan\n5. **Proof Validator** → Validates results\n\n**WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW:**\nThe task_planner agent must create a comprehensive plan addressing:\n- Concrete technology choices (framework, deployment platform)\n- Specific content sections with wireframes/structure\n- Screenshot capture methodology (which templates, which execution flows)\n- Step-by-step implementation approach\n- Deployment checklist with domain setup\n- Measurable success criteria (performance, accessibility, engagement)\n- Evidence collection plan (screenshots, metrics, test results)\n\n**I WILL NOT APPROVE THIS** until a proper plan exists with clear, verifiable evidence that the showcase will be professional, comprehensive, and deployment-ready."
