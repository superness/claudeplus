    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants to optimize the responsive layout of desktop-mode.html to prevent content overflow on mobile devices while preserving existing styling. The issue is that chat content can cause the page to overflow vertically depending on content length and phone resolution.\n\nAPPROACH: Analyze the current HTML/CSS structure, identify overflow issues, and implement mobile-responsive fixes using CSS Grid/Flexbox, viewport units, and overflow handling without breaking existing desktop styling.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read desktop-mode.html to understand current structure and styling\n2) Use Grep to find any related CSS files that might affect the layout\n3) Analyze the chat container, input areas, and overall page structure\n4) Identify specific elements causing overflow (likely chat history, input containers)\n5) Implement CSS fixes using media queries for mobile viewports\n6) Add proper overflow handling for chat content areas\n7) Ensure input areas remain accessible and don't get cut off\n8) Test responsive behavior using CSS viewport units and flexible layouts\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will address various mobile screen sizes (small phones to larger devices), different chat content lengths (short vs long conversations), images in chat history, and keyboard popup scenarios that might affect viewport height.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will show before/after code changes, demonstrate specific CSS properties added for mobile responsiveness, and verify that desktop styling remains intact while mobile overflow issues are resolved.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined CSS/HTML responsive design task with clear overflow issues to address using standard web development techniques."
