    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to read the technical build plan document for Super Axe Coin (AXE) and implement the system according to that specification. This will involve understanding the architecture, components, and requirements outlined in the plan, then building out the cryptocurrency/token system.\n\nAPPROACH: First read the technical build plan to understand what needs to be built, then systematically implement each component according to the specification. This will likely involve creating smart contracts, agent systems, or other blockchain-related code as defined in the document.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read `doc/TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md` using the Read tool to understand the full specification\n2) Explore the existing codebase structure using Glob to understand what's already implemented (based on git log showing \"Initialize SuperAxeCoin repository structure with core implementation files\")\n3) Read any existing implementation files to understand current state\n4) Create a detailed todo list breaking down the build into manageable components based on the technical plan\n5) Implement each component sequentially:\n   - Core token/coin mechanics\n   - Agent group system (referenced in recent commit)\n   - Any smart contracts or blockchain integrations\n   - Supporting infrastructure (APIs, utilities, etc.)\n6) Write tests for each component as they are built\n7) Validate the implementation against the technical plan requirements\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Will need to understand what testing framework is specified in the technical plan\n- Unit tests for individual components\n- Integration tests for agent group interactions\n- Edge cases for token operations (transfers, minting, burning if applicable)\n- Security considerations for any cryptographic operations\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will provide the contents of the technical build plan\n- Show existing codebase structure\n- Document each implementation step with code references\n- Demonstrate test coverage for implemented features\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to first read the technical build plan to understand the full scope. The recent commits suggest there's already some structure in place, which will inform the implementation approach. Confidence will increase after reviewing the specification.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: \n\nThe plan demonstrates a reasonable high-level approach but has several significant weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Correctly identifies the first critical step: reading the technical build plan\n- Acknowledges existing codebase needs to be explored\n- Mentions testing as part of the implementation process\n- Honest about medium confidence due to unknown specification details\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Premature specificity without information**: The plan lists specific implementation items (token mechanics, smart contracts, APIs) before actually reading the technical plan. This is speculative and could be completely wrong.\n\n2. **Vague evidence collection**: \"Document each implementation step with code references\" and \"Demonstrate test coverage\" are not concrete. What specific artifacts will prove completion? What metrics define success?\n\n3. **No verification criteria**: How will we know the implementation matches the spec? There's no mention of a checklist or validation step comparing implemented features against the technical plan's requirements.\n\n4. **Missing completion definition**: What constitutes \"done\"? All features implemented? Tests passing? Code compiling? This is undefined.\n\n5. **The plan essentially says \"read the doc, then figure it out\"**: While pragmatic, this means we're approving a plan that admits it doesn't know what it's actually building yet.\n\n**What would make this stronger:**\n- Read the technical plan FIRST, then create a concrete implementation plan\n- Define specific success criteria based on the actual spec\n- List verifiable deliverables (e.g., \"X contract deployed\", \"Y tests passing\", \"Z endpoints functional\")\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Insufficient\n\nThe proposed evidence is too vague. \"Show existing codebase structure\" and \"document each implementation step\" don't provide verifiable proof of completion. There's no concrete success criteria tied to the technical plan's actual requirements.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\nThe plan is putting the cart before the horse. It proposes implementation steps before understanding what needs to be built. The correct first step should be: read the technical plan, THEN create a detailed implementation plan with specific, verifiable deliverables. Return to planning after the document has been read and a concrete build plan with measurable success criteria can be created.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED"
