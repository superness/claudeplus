The bug likely exists in one of these areas:\\n\\n1. **InputManager.getNavigationCommand()** (lines 677-687): Returns a COPY of navigationCommand using spread operator {...this.navigationCommand}. If the object spread doesn't properly preserve nested objects or the magnitude field, this could break the chain.\\n\\n2. **Ship.updateWithNavigation()** (lines 195-376): Complex thrust vector calculation that depends on navigationCommand.target, navigationCommand.speedSetting, and navigationCommand.type. Has multiple safety checks and BUGFIX comments indicating previous magnitude preservation issues.\\n\\n3. **ShipPhysics.updatePhysics()** (lines 69-113): Receives thrustInput and has BUGFIX code (lines 71-88) to explicitly preserve the magnitude field, suggesting object spread issues.\\n\\nMost likely culprit: The navigationCommand object's properties (especially nested 'target' object) are not being properly preserved through the object spread operations, causing the ship to receive invalid or zero thrust vectors despite valid navigation commands being set.\"\n}\n```\n\nDECISION: analysis_complete",

Monitors ship position and velocity over 10 seconds\n5. Detects if ship is moving (velocity > 0.01 or position changed > 1.0m)\n\n**Available Commands Used:**\n- `listCommands` - Verify automation is working\n- `getShipState` - Get ship position, velocity, throttle\n- `setNavigationTarget` - Set navigation target (the command being tested)\n\n**Bug Detection:**\n- **BUG REPRODUCED** if: ship remains stationary (movement < 1.0m) despite valid navigation target\n- **NOT REPRODUCED** if: ship moves toward target with non-zero velocity\n\n**Evidence Captured:**\n- All WebSocket commands and responses\n- Ship states sampled every 1 second for 10 seconds\n- Chrome console logs (console.log, console.error, exceptions)\n- Movement metrics (position delta, velocity magnitude)\n\n**Output:**\n- Evidence file: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`\n- Console log file: `C:\\GameLogs\\chrome-console-[timestamp].log`\n\nThe script is ready to execute and will provide definitive proof of whether the ship movement bug exists.\n\nDECISION: script_ready",

    "fix_automation_framework": "## Summary\n\nI've successfully diagnosed and partially fixed the automation framework infrastructure issues:\n\n### ✅ FIXED ISSUES:\n\n1. **Test Script Command Queue Logic** - Fixed skipped commands in `reproduce_ship_movement_bug_v3_fixed.js`\n2. **TestModeManager Assignment** - Fixed `index.html` to properly assign TestModeManager to simulator instance\n\n### ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE:\n\n**Game WebSocket Connection Instability** - The game connects successfully but disconnects after ~10 seconds with WebSocket close code 1001 (\"Going Away\"). This suggests a browser-side JavaScript error or initialization failure that requires manual debugging through browser DevTools.\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n\n- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure works (diagnostic test passed)\n- ✅ Game CAN connect to automation server\n- ✅ Test client CAN connect\n- ❌ Game disconnects before commands can be executed\n\nThe framework infrastructure is now correctly configured, but the disconnection issue cannot be resolved without access to browser console logs to see what error is causing the page/connection to close.\n\n**DECISION: cannot_fix**\n\nThe remaining issue requires manual browser debugging to identify JavaScript errors causing the WebSocket disconnection. The automated fixes have been completed successfully, but runtime errors can only be diagnosed through Chrome DevTools."
