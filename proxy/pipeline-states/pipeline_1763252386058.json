    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants to improve the Station UI's manufacturing/crafting interface for better readability and accessibility. They've provided a screenshot (stationuiiteration.PNG) showing the current UI has wasted space and needs larger text, better spacing, and improved layout for users with lower resolution displays or eye strain issues.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First examine the screenshot to understand current UI layout and identify wasted space\n2. Locate the Station UI code files (StationUI.js, station-related CSS)\n3. Review current manufacturing/crafting UI implementation\n4. Identify specific areas with poor space utilization and small text\n5. Plan CSS and JavaScript changes to improve readability with larger fonts, better spacing, and more efficient use of available screen real estate\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read the screenshot file `stationuiiteration.PNG` to see current UI state and identify specific problems\n2) Use Glob to find Station UI related files: `**/*station*.{js,css}` and `**/*craft*.{js,css}` \n3) Read `js/ui/StationUI.js` to understand current manufacturing/crafting UI implementation\n4) Read relevant CSS files (likely `css/station*.css` or main CSS files) to see current styling\n5) Identify specific elements with poor readability:\n   - Text sizes that are too small\n   - Wasted whitespace or overly compact layouts\n   - Areas where information is cramped\n6) Review any previous changes made to understand what was already attempted\n7) Plan specific CSS changes:\n   - Increase font sizes (body text, headers, labels, values)\n   - Increase spacing/padding around UI elements\n   - Adjust container widths to use more screen space\n   - Improve contrast and visual hierarchy\n8) Plan JavaScript changes if needed for layout structure\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Will verify changes work at 1600x900 resolution (the project's UI scale based on git history)\n- Will ensure text remains readable at lower resolutions\n- Will check that increased spacing doesn't cause overflow issues\n- Will verify all manufacturing/crafting information is still visible and accessible\n- Will ensure changes don't break existing functionality\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will show the current screenshot analysis identifying specific problem areas\n- Will show current CSS values (font-sizes, padding, margins, widths)\n- Will show current JavaScript DOM structure for the manufacturing UI\n- Will identify specific measurements that need changing\n- Will provide before/after comparison of text sizes and spacing values\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward UI/UX improvement task focused on CSS and potentially minor DOM structure changes. The screenshot provides clear visual reference, and the codebase structure is well-documented with clear file organization.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "I need to examine the plan from the previous stage to provide my assessment.\n\nASSESSMENT: The plan shows a solid understanding of the user's request to improve readability in the Station UI manufacturing/crafting interface. The approach is logical and systematic:\n\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The planner correctly identified that the issue is about readability, accessibility, wasted space, and the need for larger text in the manufacturing/crafting UI.\n\n2. **Logical Steps**: The approach follows a sensible progression:\n   - First examine the screenshot to understand the problem\n   - Locate relevant files (StationUI.js and CSS files)\n   - Review current implementation\n   - Identify specific problem areas\n   - Plan and implement changes\n\n3. **Concrete Evidence Plan**: The plan specifies collecting:\n   - Screenshot analysis identifying problem areas\n   - Current CSS values (font-sizes, padding, margins, widths)\n   - Current JavaScript DOM structure\n   - Specific measurements that need changing\n   - Before/after comparison of values\n\n4. **Testing Considerations**: The plan accounts for the 1600x900 resolution mentioned in the project, lower resolution testing, and ensuring no functionality breaks.\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Systematic approach starting with understanding the problem via the screenshot\n- Appropriate file discovery strategy using Glob patterns\n- Good coverage of both CSS and potential JavaScript changes\n- Considers testing at the project's target resolution (1600x900)\n\n**Potential Concerns**:\n- The evidence section could be more specific about what \"before/after comparison\" means - will this be in the code comments, or actual screenshots?\n- The plan mentions \"previous changes\" but doesn't specify how to identify what was already attempted\n- No mention of verifying changes in an actual browser (though this may be implied)\n\nHowever, these are minor concerns. The plan provides sufficient structure to identify problems, make targeted improvements, and verify the changes are effective.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong - The plan specifies concrete code artifacts (CSS values, DOM structure, specific measurements) that will prove the task was completed. The evidence is verifiable and directly relates to the user's concerns about readability and wasted space.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED (Plan approved, proceed to execution)"
