  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality, production-ready spaceship crafting interface mockup with glassy effects that integrates into existing menu systems, informed by AAA game standards and designed for real data integration.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA crafting systems, analyze current codebase architecture, design component hierarchy with modern UI patterns, implement glassmorphism effects, and create modular data-driven components.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA spaceship/crafting games (Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky, Stellaris)\n2) Use Glob/Read tools to analyze existing codebase structure and identify menu container patterns\n3) Research modern UI frameworks and glassmorphism CSS techniques via WebSearch\n4) Design component architecture with props interfaces for real data integration\n5) Implement base container component that fits existing menu structure\n6) Create item/component data models and mock data structures\n7) Build crafting tree/recipe display components with dependency visualization\n8) Implement glassmorphism styling with CSS/SCSS animations and effects\n9) Add interactive elements (hover states, selection, drag-drop if applicable)\n10) Create responsive design that works across different screen sizes\n11) Implement state management for crafting queue and inventory simulation\n12) Add sound effect placeholders and animation timing for polish\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various recipe complexities (simple 2-component items vs complex multi-tier crafting), different item types, empty/full inventory states, mobile responsiveness, and integration with different container sizes.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working demo with multiple crafting scenarios, code documentation showing data integration points, performance metrics, and visual comparison with AAA game references.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - Complex UI project requiring research and multiple technologies, but achievable with systematic approach and clear deliverables."
