    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to fix mobile layout overflow issues in desktop-mode.html where content can overflow at the bottom depending on chat content and phone resolution, while preserving existing styling.\n\nAPPROACH: First examine the current HTML structure and CSS styling in desktop-mode.html, identify layout issues causing mobile overflow, then implement responsive fixes using CSS flexbox/grid techniques and viewport-relative units to ensure content always fits within mobile viewports.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read desktop-mode.html to understand current structure and styling\n2) Use Grep to search for CSS classes and mobile-specific styles in the file\n3) Analyze the layout structure (containers, chat areas, input areas) \n4) Identify overflow causes (fixed heights, inadequate mobile CSS, content expansion)\n5) Implement responsive CSS fixes using:\n   - CSS flexbox with flex-grow/shrink properties\n   - Viewport units (vh, vw) for height constraints\n   - Media queries for mobile-specific adjustments\n   - Overflow handling for chat content areas\n6) Test the changes by examining the updated code structure\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will ensure the layout works across different mobile resolutions (small phones, large phones, tablets), handles varying chat content lengths (short messages, long messages, images), and maintains functionality on both portrait and landscape orientations. Will verify input areas remain accessible and chat history doesn't get cut off.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide before/after code comparison showing specific CSS changes made, demonstrate how the new layout structure prevents overflow, and show implementation of responsive design principles.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a standard responsive web design task involving CSS layout optimization, which can be solved with established mobile-first design patterns and viewport management techniques."
