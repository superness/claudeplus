    "planning": "Now I have a comprehensive understanding of everything needed. Let me create a plan for this comprehensive Business Plan Elaboration Pipeline.\n\n---\n\n**UNDERSTANDING:** \nThe user wants a pipeline that takes the MineBox thesis refinement document and expands it into a complete business plan with documentation from all business perspectives. The pipeline should:\n1. Generate multiple markdown files (not execute anything)\n2. Include review loops between agents\n3. Create timelines and milestones\n4. Cover all business perspectives (market, finance, technical, operations, legal, etc.)\n5. Use the pipeline engine's unique features (routing decisions, conditional flows, loops)\n6. Explicitly create each document as a pipeline stage\n\n**APPROACH:**\nCreate a comprehensive \"Business Plan Elaboration Pipeline\" with 30+ stages organized into:\n1. **Input & Analysis Phase** - Read and parse the thesis document\n2. **Market Perspective Loop** - Market research, competitor analysis, customer personas (with review cycle)\n3. **Financial Perspective Loop** - Revenue models, projections, funding strategy (with review cycle)\n4. **Technical Perspective Loop** - Architecture, implementation roadmap, technical feasibility (with review cycle)\n5. **Operations Perspective Loop** - Launch plan, supply chain, customer support (with review cycle)\n6. **Legal/Compliance Perspective Loop** - Terms of service, privacy, regulatory (with review cycle)\n7. **Executive Summary Phase** - Synthesize all perspectives\n8. **Timeline Generation Phase** - Create milestones, roadmaps, Gantt-style documents\n9. **Final Integration & Review** - Cross-perspective validation\n\nEach perspective loop has: Draft → Review → Revise → Approve pattern\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n1. **Create new agents** for business plan elaboration:\n   - `thesis_analyzer` - Parses the input thesis document\n   - `market_analyst` - Deep market research & sizing\n   - `competitor_mapper` - Competitive landscape analysis\n   - `persona_builder` - Customer persona creation\n   - `market_reviewer` - Reviews market perspective docs\n   - `revenue_modeler` - Revenue stream design\n   - `financial_projector` - Financial projections & forecasts\n   - `funding_strategist` - Funding requirements & strategy\n   - `finance_reviewer` - Reviews financial docs\n   - `technical_architect_bp` - Technical architecture docs\n   - `implementation_planner_bp` - Implementation roadmap\n   - `feasibility_assessor` - Technical feasibility analysis\n   - `technical_reviewer_bp` - Reviews technical docs\n   - `operations_designer` - Operations plan\n   - `launch_planner` - Go-to-market launch plan\n   - `support_designer` - Customer support strategy\n   - `operations_reviewer` - Reviews operations docs\n   - `legal_analyst` - Legal/regulatory analysis\n   - `compliance_mapper` - Compliance requirements\n   - `risk_assessor` - Risk assessment & mitigation\n   - `legal_reviewer` - Reviews legal docs\n   - `executive_synthesizer` - Creates executive summary\n   - `timeline_generator` - Creates project timelines\n   - `milestone_planner` - Defines milestones\n   - `cross_perspective_validator` - Cross-checks all docs\n   - `final_integrator_bp` - Final document package\n\n2. **Design the pipeline JSON structure**:\n   - Input stage reads the thesis file\n   - 5 parallel perspective tracks (market, finance, tech, ops, legal)\n   - Each track has 3-4 stages with review loops\n   - Review stages can route back for revision or forward for approval\n   - Executive summary synthesizes all approved outputs\n   - Timeline generation creates chronological documents\n   - Final integration validates the complete package\n\n3. **Define routing decisions** for each review agent:\n   - `approved` → proceed to next stage\n   - `needs_revision` → loop back to drafting stage\n   - `major_issues` → loop back with specific feedback\n   - `perspective_conflict` → route to cross-perspective validator\n\n4. **Specify explicit document outputs** for each stage:\n   - `01-executive-summary.md`\n   - `02-market-analysis/market-sizing.md`\n   - `02-market-analysis/competitor-landscape.md`\n   - `02-market-analysis/customer-personas.md`\n   - `03-financial-plan/revenue-model.md`\n   - `03-financial-plan/5-year-projections.md`\n   - `03-financial-plan/funding-strategy.md`\n   - `04-technical-plan/architecture-overview.md`\n   - `04-technical-plan/implementation-roadmap.md`\n   - `04-technical-plan/technical-feasibility.md`\n   - `05-operations-plan/launch-strategy.md`\n   - `05-operations-plan/customer-support-plan.md`\n   - `05-operations-plan/supply-chain.md`\n   - `06-legal-compliance/regulatory-analysis.md`\n   - `06-legal-compliance/risk-assessment.md`\n   - `06-legal-compliance/compliance-requirements.md`\n   - `07-timeline/project-milestones.md`\n   - `07-timeline/gantt-chart.md`\n   - `07-timeline/quarterly-roadmap.md`\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- Each review loop should be tested by having the reviewer agent actually reject drafts to verify the loop functions\n- The cross-perspective validator should catch conflicts (e.g., financial projections not matching technical timeline)\n- Edge cases: thesis missing key information should trigger requests for clarification\n- Large document handling: ensure agents can handle verbose outputs without truncation\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Pipeline JSON file created at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/business-plan-elaborator-v1.json`\n- 26+ new agent JSON files created in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/`\n- Test run of pipeline generates all expected markdown files\n- Review loops demonstrate actual revision cycles in execution logs\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** High - The existing pipeline infrastructure (living-game-world-v1, meta-pipeline-builder-v1) demonstrates proven patterns for complex multi-stage pipelines with review loops. The thesis document provides clear structure for the business plan content.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Pipeline Design\n\n### Phase 1: Input & Foundation\n```\n[thesis_analyzer] → Reads minebox-thesis-refinement.md\n                  → Extracts key theses, arguments, evidence needs\n                  → Creates foundation document\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Market Perspective (with loop)\n```\n[market_analyst] → Creates market-sizing.md\n                 ↓\n[competitor_mapper] → Creates competitor-landscape.md\n                    ↓\n[persona_builder] → Creates customer-personas.md\n                  ↓\n[market_reviewer] ⟲ Loop: approved → next phase\n                    ⟲ Loop: needs_revision → back to market_analyst\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Financial Perspective (with loop)\n```\n[revenue_modeler] → Creates revenue-model.md\n                  ↓\n[financial_projector] → Creates 5-year-projections.md\n                      ↓\n[funding_strategist] → Creates funding-strategy.md\n                     ↓\n[finance_reviewer] ⟲ Loop: approved → next phase\n                   ⟲ Loop: needs_revision → back to revenue_modeler\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Technical Perspective (with loop)\n```\n[technical_architect_bp] → Creates architecture-overview.md\n                         ↓\n[implementation_planner_bp] → Creates implementation-roadmap.md\n                            ↓\n[feasibility_assessor] → Creates technical-feasibility.md\n                       ↓\n[technical_reviewer_bp] ⟲ Loop: approved → next phase\n                        ⟲ Loop: needs_revision → back to technical_architect_bp\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Operations Perspective (with loop)\n```\n[operations_designer] → Creates operations-plan.md\n                      ↓\n[launch_planner] → Creates launch-strategy.md\n                 ↓\n[support_designer] → Creates customer-support-plan.md\n                   ↓\n[operations_reviewer] ⟲ Loop: approved → next phase\n                      ⟲ Loop: needs_revision → back to operations_designer\n```\n\n### Phase 6: Legal Perspective (with loop)\n```\n[legal_analyst] → Creates regulatory-analysis.md\n               ↓\n[compliance_mapper] → Creates compliance-requirements.md\n                    ↓\n[risk_assessor] → Creates risk-assessment.md\n                ↓\n[legal_reviewer] ⟲ Loop: approved → next phase\n                 ⟲ Loop: needs_revision → back to legal_analyst\n```\n\n### Phase 7: Cross-Validation & Integration\n```\n[cross_perspective_validator] → Validates all perspectives align\n                              ⟲ Loop: conflict_found → routes to specific perspective\n                              → approved → synthesis\n```\n\n### Phase 8: Executive Summary & Timeline\n```\n[executive_synthesizer] → Creates 01-executive-summary.md\n                        ↓\n[milestone_planner] → Creates project-milestones.md\n                    ↓\n[timeline_generator] → Creates gantt-chart.md, quarterly-roadmap.md\n                     ↓\n[final_integrator_bp] → Final validation, creates table-of-contents.md\n```\n\n[DECISION: plan_complete]",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\nThis is an ambitious and well-structured plan for a Business Plan Elaboration Pipeline. Let me evaluate it critically:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan correctly interprets the user's intent - generating documentation and data, not executing business tasks. The thesis refinement document is well understood.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The 8 phases cover all major business perspectives (Market, Financial, Technical, Operations, Legal) plus synthesis and timeline generation.\n\n3. **Review Loops**: The plan correctly incorporates review cycles with routing decisions (approved → proceed, needs_revision → loop back). This is a key requirement the user explicitly requested.\n\n4. **Explicit Document Outputs**: The plan specifies 19+ distinct markdown files organized into logical directories. This matches the user's request for \"lots of .md files.\"\n\n5. **Use of Pipeline Features**: The plan leverages routing decisions, conditional flows, and looping - demonstrating understanding of the pipeline engine's unique capabilities.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n1. **26 New Agents is Aggressive**: Creating 26 new agent JSON files is substantial. However, the plan correctly identifies this as necessary given the scope. Each agent has a distinct, non-overlapping purpose.\n\n2. **Review Loop Mechanics Need Clarification**: The plan mentions \"routing decisions\" but doesn't specify the exact `decision` field values and `next_stage` mappings. The pipeline JSON will need explicit routing configuration.\n\n3. **Missing Cross-Perspective Routing Details**: The cross_perspective_validator's \"conflict_found\" routing to specific perspectives is mentioned but not detailed. Which stage does it route to? The market_analyst, revenue_modeler, etc.?\n\n4. **Evidence Collection is Concrete**: The plan specifies exact file paths for both the pipeline JSON and agent files, plus the expected markdown outputs. This is verifiable.\n\n5. **Timeline Documents**: The plan includes gantt-chart.md and quarterly-roadmap.md which are challenging to generate as text. However, these can be structured markdown tables.\n\n**Critical Verification Points:**\n\n- Pipeline file at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/business-plan-elaborator-v1.json` - Verifiable\n- Agent files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` - Verifiable (26 files)\n- Review loops in pipeline JSON with proper routing - Verifiable\n- Markdown file outputs during test run - Verifiable\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe plan provides:\n- Exact file paths for all outputs\n- Clear structure for verification (pipeline JSON, agent files, output directories)\n- Testable assertions (review loops should demonstrate revision cycles in logs)\n- Specific document names (01-executive-summary.md, etc.)\n\nThe evidence plan is concrete and achievable. The only minor weakness is that some routing details are implicit rather than explicit, but the overall structure is sound.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
