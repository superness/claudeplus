    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create an agent JSON specification for an rpc_tester agent that will test Bitcoin RPC functionality in the SuperCoinServ mining pool. The agent needs to validate all RPC endpoints used by the pool, test authentication/authorization, monitor performance metrics, detect errors/timeouts, and generate test reports.\n\nAPPROACH: Based on the exploration results, I'll design a comprehensive test agent that:\n1. Tests all identified RPC methods (getblocktemplate, submitblock, getinfo, etc.) - approximately 30+ methods found\n2. Validates HTTP Basic Authentication with credentials from daemon config\n3. Tests error handling for all RPC exception types (timeout, connection, error codes)\n4. Monitors RPC latency and throughput metrics\n5. Generates structured test reports with pass/fail status\n6. Uses the existing DaemonClient configuration structure for connectivity\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read example agent JSON files from /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ to understand the agent schema and format\n2) Review the DaemonClient.cs file to get complete list of RPC methods to test\n3) Review DaemonConfig.cs to understand authentication configuration structure\n4) Review RpcErrorCode.cs to get all error codes to test\n5) Design test cases covering:\n   - Basic connectivity tests (getinfo, getnetworkinfo, getblockchaininfo)\n   - Mining-critical methods (getblocktemplate, submitblock, getmininginfo)\n   - Transaction methods (gettransaction, sendmany, validateaddress)\n   - Block methods (getblock, getblockhash, getblockcount)\n   - Error scenarios (invalid params, timeout simulation, connection failures)\n   - Authentication failures (wrong credentials, missing credentials)\n   - Performance benchmarks (latency measurement, throughput testing)\n6) Create JSON structure with:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, permissions, decisions)\n   - Test configuration parameters (RPC endpoints, credentials, timeout thresholds)\n   - Test execution workflow (sequential test execution with error handling)\n   - Report generation logic (JSON/text output with metrics)\n7) Write the complete agent JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/rpc_tester.json\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- **RPC Method Coverage**: Will test all 30+ RPC methods identified in exploration (getblocktemplate, submitblock, getinfo, getnetworkinfo, getblock, gettransaction, sendmany, validateaddress, etc.)\n- **Authentication Tests**: Test valid credentials, invalid username, invalid password, missing credentials\n- **Error Code Handling**: Test all RPC error codes from RpcErrorCode.cs (-32600 to -32700 JSON-RPC errors, -1 to -26 Bitcoin errors)\n- **Timeout Scenarios**: Test with very short timeout values to trigger RpcTimeoutException\n- **Connection Failures**: Test with invalid host/port to trigger RpcConnectionException\n- **Performance Metrics**: Measure latency (avg/min/max/p95/p99), throughput (requests/sec), success rate\n- **Edge Cases**: Empty parameters, malformed JSON, unsupported methods, blockchain sync state\n- **Multi-Pool Testing**: Test against multiple daemon configurations if multiple pools configured\n- **Report Formats**: Generate both JSON (machine-readable) and text (human-readable) reports\n\nEVIDENCE: The agent will collect and report:\n1. **Test Execution Log**: Timestamp, method name, parameters, response time, status (pass/fail), error details\n2. **Authentication Results**: Success/failure for each credential configuration tested\n3. **Performance Metrics**: \n   - Per-method latency statistics (min/max/avg/median/p95/p99)\n   - Overall throughput (total requests/sec)\n   - Success rate percentage\n   - Timeout count and percentage\n4. **Error Analysis**:\n   - Count of each RPC error code encountered\n   - List of failed methods with error messages\n   - Connection failure details\n5. **Coverage Report**: List of all RPC methods tested vs. methods available\n6. **Summary Statistics**: Total tests, passed, failed, skipped, execution time\n7. **Raw RPC Responses**: Sample responses for validation (optional verbose mode)\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - I have comprehensive understanding of:\n- The complete RPC implementation architecture from the exploration\n- All RPC methods used by the pool (30+ methods identified)\n- Authentication mechanism (HTTP Basic Auth with DaemonConfig)\n- Error handling structure (RpcException hierarchy, error codes)\n- Configuration file structure (daemon config in pool JSON)\n- Agent JSON schema requirements (from user specifications)\n- Performance monitoring requirements (latency, throughput metrics)\n\nThe agent design will be straightforward as it follows standard testing patterns: connect, authenticate, execute tests, collect metrics, generate report. The exploration provided complete visibility into the RPC implementation details.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT: \n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive understanding of the SuperCoinServ Bitcoin RPC architecture, including DaemonClient, RpcException hierarchy, and authentication mechanisms\n2. **Concrete Steps**: Well-defined 7-step approach from reading examples to writing the final JSON\n3. **Thorough Test Coverage**: Excellent coverage including 30+ RPC methods, authentication scenarios, error codes, timeouts, performance metrics, and edge cases\n4. **Specific Evidence Collection**: Highly detailed evidence plan with 7 categories including execution logs, performance metrics, error analysis, and coverage reports\n5. **Technical Depth**: Shows understanding of HTTP Basic Auth, RPC error codes (-32600 to -32700, -1 to -26), timeout thresholds, and multi-pool configurations\n\n**Weaknesses/Concerns:**\n1. **Implementation Complexity**: The plan is quite ambitious - testing 30+ methods with authentication, performance metrics, error scenarios, and multi-format reports in a single agent JSON file may be overly complex\n2. **Missing Specifics**: While the plan mentions \"reading example agent JSON files,\" it doesn't specify exactly what the agent JSON schema should look like (e.g., what fields are required, how the \"prompt\" field should be structured)\n3. **Verification Gap**: No clear step to validate the JSON is syntactically correct or matches the expected schema before final write\n4. **Dependency Assumptions**: Assumes access to daemon configuration files and running Bitcoin daemons for testing - no fallback if these aren't available\n\n**Evidence Quality Analysis:**\n\nThe proposed evidence is **comprehensive and specific**:\n- ✅ Test execution logs with timestamps, methods, parameters, response times\n- ✅ Quantifiable metrics (latency stats, throughput, success rates)\n- ✅ Error analysis with specific error codes and counts\n- ✅ Coverage reports comparing tested vs. available methods\n- ✅ Summary statistics (total/passed/failed/skipped)\n- ✅ Optional raw RPC responses for validation\n\nThis is machine-verifiable and provides concrete proof of test execution.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\nDespite minor concerns about complexity and schema validation, the plan shows:\n- Crystal clear understanding of Bitcoin RPC testing requirements\n- Logical step-by-step approach from research to implementation\n- Exceptionally detailed evidence collection that will provide concrete, verifiable proof\n- High confidence backed by thorough exploration results\n\nThe evidence quality is strong enough to verify task completion through test logs, metrics, and reports.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
