  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality spaceship game crafting interface mockup that can integrate into existing menu systems, with competitive analysis of AAA game standards and modern glassy spaceship aesthetics.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA crafting systems, analyze current codebase structure, design component-based crafting UI with spaceship theming, create modular implementation that accepts external data sources.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA space game crafting interfaces (Elite Dangerous, No Man's Sky, Star Citizen, EVE Online)\n2) Use Glob tool to explore current codebase structure and identify existing menu systems\n3) Use Read tool to examine existing UI components and styling patterns\n4) Design data structure for crafting recipes, components, and items\n5) Create main CraftingInterface component with proper props for external data integration\n6) Implement ItemGrid component for displaying craftable items\n7) Create RecipeView component showing required components and crafting process\n8) Build ComponentInventory display for available materials\n9) Design CraftingQueue for batch operations\n10) Implement glassy spaceship visual effects using CSS/styled-components\n11) Create responsive design that fits within existing menu container constraints\n12) Add interactive states (hover, selection, crafting progress)\n13) Write comprehensive documentation for integration\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various data scenarios including empty inventories, missing components, complex multi-tier recipes, different screen sizes, and integration with mock existing menu systems. Will validate accessibility and performance with large item catalogs.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working demo with sample data, screenshots of competitive analysis findings, code documentation showing integration points, and responsive design demonstrations across different viewport sizes.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined UI development task with clear deliverables and established patterns from gaming industry research."
