  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality, game-ready spaceship crafting interface mockup that mimics AAA gaming standards, features glassy spaceship UI aesthetics, integrates with existing menu systems, and supports component-based item crafting with real data compatibility.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA space game crafting systems, analyze UI/UX patterns, then design and implement a modular React/Vue component with modern web technologies, focusing on glassmorphism effects and spaceship-themed visuals.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA space games (Elite Dangerous, No Man's Sky, Star Citizen, EVE Online) crafting interfaces\n2) Use WebSearch to find UI/UX patterns and design principles for game crafting systems\n3) Use Glob to examine existing codebase structure and identify framework/technology stack\n4) Use Read to analyze existing menu container implementation and styling patterns\n5) Create component architecture plan supporting modular data integration\n6) Implement base crafting interface component with glassmorphism styling\n7) Build item grid/list display with component requirements visualization\n8) Add interactive crafting logic (drag-drop, selection, validation)\n9) Implement spaceship-themed animations and visual effects\n10) Create responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes\n11) Add accessibility features and keyboard navigation\n12) Write comprehensive documentation for integration\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various item types, complex crafting recipes with multiple components, edge cases like insufficient materials, mobile responsiveness, performance with large item catalogs, integration with different data source formats, and accessibility compliance.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working demo with sample data, comparative analysis screenshots from AAA games, performance metrics, accessibility audit results, integration documentation, and code structure showing modularity for real data sources.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - Complex UI/UX project requiring both research and technical implementation, but clear requirements and established patterns in gaming industry provide good foundation."
