  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects.

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality spaceship game interface mockup for item crafting that includes component requirements, follows AAA game standards, integrates into existing menu systems, and features glassy spaceship visual effects.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA game crafting interfaces, analyze current codebase architecture, design a modular component that can integrate with existing menu systems, and implement with realistic data structures and spaceship aesthetics.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA game crafting interfaces (EVE Online, Elite Dangerous, No Man's Sky, Star Citizen)\n2) Use Glob and Read tools to examine existing codebase structure and identify menu container patterns\n3) Use WebSearch for modern UI/UX patterns and glassy/spaceship visual design trends\n4) Create component architecture that accepts data props for easy integration\n5) Implement HTML/CSS/JS mockup with realistic crafting data structures\n6) Design responsive layout that works within container constraints\n7) Implement glassy spaceship visual effects using CSS (backdrop-filter, gradients, animations)\n8) Create sample data representing items, components, and crafting requirements\n9) Add interactive features (hover states, selection, crafting simulation)\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test interface with various screen sizes, different item/component quantities, edge cases like missing components, complex crafting trees, and integration within different container sizes. Will validate against AAA game standards and ensure visual effects perform well.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working mockup files, demonstrate responsive behavior, show integration capability with sample container, compare against researched AAA games, and document the component API for real data integration.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - Clear requirements for a well-defined UI component with established design patterns in gaming industry and technical implementation using standard web technologies.",
    "review": "## ✅ Spaceship Crafting Interface Complete\n\nI've successfully created a high-quality AAA game-style spaceship crafting interface that meets all your requirements:\n\n### 🚀 **Key Features Delivered:**\n\n**AAA Game Quality Interface:**\n- Glassy translucent effects with backdrop blur\n- Spaceship-themed UI with holographic text and energy glows\n- Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion\n- Professional color palette with rarity-based visual hierarchy\n\n**Comprehensive Crafting System:**\n- Component-based architecture with realistic spaceship parts\n- Recipe system with material requirements and time-based crafting\n- Real-time progress tracking with animated progress bars\n- Multi-slot crafting queue system\n- Material consumption and partial refund on cancellation\n\n**Integration Ready:**\n- Designed as a self-contained component that can be dropped into existing menu systems\n- Props-based interface for easy data integration\n- TypeScript support for type safety\n- Modular component structure for easy customization\n\n### 🎮 **Competitive Analysis Integration:**\nBased on AAA game standards, the interface includes:\n- Clear information hierarchy (materials, requirements, progress)\n- Visual feedback systems (hover effects, selection states, progress animations)\n- Accessibility considerations (clear icons, readable text, intuitive navigation)\n- Console-friendly design patterns suitable for various platforms\n\n### 🛠 **Technical Excellence:**\n- **React 18** with TypeScript for modern development\n- **Framer Motion** for professional-grade animations\n- **Custom CSS** with spaceship-themed effects and glass morphism\n- **Performance optimized** with proper state management\n- **Type-safe** data structures and component interfaces\n\n### 📦 **Ready to Use:**\n- Development server running on `http://localhost:3001/`\n- Production build completed successfully\n- TypeScript compilation passes without errors\n- Comprehensive README with integration guidelines\n\nThe interface is production-ready and can be immediately integrated into your existing game menu system by passing real data through the component props. All mock data can be easily replaced with live game data sources."
