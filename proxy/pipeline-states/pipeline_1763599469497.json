    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the `miner_pool_connector` agent based on section 2.2 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document. This agent will handle establishing and validating stratum connections between miners and mining pools, including connection configuration, authentication, and state monitoring.\n\nAPPROACH: First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 specifications, then examine any existing agent JSON files to understand the structure/format used in this project. Create a comprehensive agent JSON that handles stratum protocol connection setup, subscription, authorization, and connection state monitoring with the specified decision outcomes.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` focusing on section 2.2 to extract detailed requirements\n2) Use Glob tool to find existing agent JSON files with pattern `**/agents/*.json` to understand the expected JSON schema/structure\n3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example agent JSON files to understand:\n   - Required fields (name, description, permissions, decisions, etc.)\n   - Tool configuration format\n   - Decision flow structure\n   - Prompt/instruction format\n4) Use Grep tool to search for stratum-related code with pattern `stratum` in relevant directories to understand existing stratum implementation\n5) Use Grep tool to search for pool connection code with pattern `pool.*connect` to find relevant connection logic\n6) Design the agent JSON structure including:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Permissions array: [\"Read\", \"Write\", \"Edit\", \"Bash\", \"Glob\", \"Grep\"]\n   - Decisions array: [\"stratum_connected\", \"subscribe_successful\", \"authorize_successful\", \"connection_failed\", \"error\"]\n   - Detailed prompt/instructions for:\n     * Reading pool configuration (URL, port, worker credentials)\n     * Generating miner connection strings\n     * Establishing stratum TCP connection\n     * Sending stratum.subscribe message\n     * Validating subscribe response\n     * Sending stratum.authorize with worker credentials\n     * Validating authorize response\n     * Monitoring connection state\n     * Error handling and appropriate decision routing\n7) Use Write tool to create `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/miner_pool_connector.json` with the complete agent definition\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Will include logic to handle various pool configurations (different ports, protocols)\n- Will validate connection string format before attempting connection\n- Will implement timeout handling for subscribe/authorize operations\n- Will test both successful and failed authorization scenarios\n- Will handle network errors and connection drops\n- Will validate stratum protocol message formats\n- Will ensure worker credentials are properly formatted\n- Will test connection state transitions (connecting → connected → authorized)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will reference specific sections from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2\n- Will show the complete agent JSON structure matching project conventions\n- Will include stratum protocol message examples in the agent instructions\n- Will demonstrate decision flow logic for all 5 outcomes\n- Will show how connection validation is performed at each step\n- Will provide error handling paths for common failure scenarios\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - While I can read the plan document and understand stratum protocol requirements, the exact JSON schema format depends on examining existing agent files in this specific project. The stratum connection logic is well-defined in mining protocols, but integration with this project's agent framework requires seeing examples first.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\nThe plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the task requirements. The designer correctly identifies the need to:\n1. Read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 specifications\n2. Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the project's schema\n3. Research existing stratum implementation in the codebase\n4. Create a comprehensive agent JSON with proper decision flows\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear step-by-step approach with logical progression\n- Recognizes the need to examine existing patterns before creating new files\n- Comprehensive coverage of stratum connection lifecycle (connect → subscribe → authorize → monitor)\n- Appropriate tool selection (Read, Glob, Grep, Write)\n- Thoughtful test considerations covering error cases, timeouts, validation\n- Plans to research both the specification document AND existing codebase implementation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The confidence level is \"Medium\" which shows appropriate humility, but could be stronger given the clear approach\n- Step 4-5 (Grep searches) might not yield results if this is a new implementation, though this is a reasonable exploration step\n\n**Evidence Collection:**\nThe plan specifies concrete evidence that will be gathered:\n- Direct references from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2\n- Complete agent JSON matching project conventions (verified by examining existing agents)\n- Stratum protocol message examples\n- Decision flow logic for all 5 specified outcomes\n- Connection validation methodology\n- Error handling scenarios\n\nThis is verifiable and concrete - we can check if the final JSON includes these elements.\n\n**Logical Soundness:**\nThe approach follows a classic \"research → understand → implement\" pattern:\n1. Read specifications (authoritative source)\n2. Examine existing implementations (learn conventions)\n3. Research relevant code (understand integration points)\n4. Design solution (synthesize knowledge)\n5. Implement solution (write the JSON file)\n\nThis is a sound methodology for creating a new component in an existing system.\n\n**Completeness:**\nAll required elements are addressed:\n- ✅ Configure miner→pool stratum connection\n- ✅ Generate miner connection string\n- ✅ Configure pool URL and port\n- ✅ Set worker credentials\n- ✅ Test stratum subscribe\n- ✅ Validate authorize response\n- ✅ Monitor connection state\n- ✅ All 5 decision outcomes planned\n- ✅ All 6 required permissions included\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe proposed evidence is specific and verifiable:\n1. Can verify section 2.2 content is incorporated\n2. Can verify JSON structure matches project conventions\n3. Can verify all 5 decision paths exist\n4. Can verify stratum protocol steps are included\n5. Can verify error handling is present\n6. Can verify the file is created at the correct path\n\nThe designer commits to showing concrete examples and logic, not just vague statements.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\n\n**Reasoning:** This plan demonstrates thorough preparation, appropriate research steps, comprehensive coverage of requirements, and a commitment to gathering concrete evidence. The methodology is sound (research existing patterns before implementing), the scope is complete (all requirements addressed), and the evidence criteria are specific and verifiable. The \"Medium\" confidence is honest given dependency on examining existing files, but the approach itself is robust enough to handle discovery along the way.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
