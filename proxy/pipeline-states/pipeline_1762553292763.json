    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a mobile-optimized version of 'desktop-mode.html' that maintains all existing features while being specifically designed for mobile layouts, running fast, and looking consistent with the desktop version.\n\nAPPROACH: First analyze the existing desktop-mode.html to understand its structure, features, and styling. Then create a mobile-specific version that optimizes the layout, interactions, and performance for mobile devices while preserving all functionality.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read and analyze C:/github/ai-assistant/www/src/desktop-mode.html to understand current structure and features\n2) Read associated CSS/JS files (desktop-renderer.js, any stylesheets) to understand styling and functionality\n3) Identify mobile-specific optimizations needed (touch interactions, viewport handling, responsive layout)\n4) Create a new mobile-mode.html file with mobile-optimized HTML structure\n5) Adapt/create mobile-specific CSS for proper mobile layout, touch targets, and responsive design\n6) Modify JavaScript interactions for mobile (touch events, keyboard handling, etc.)\n7) Ensure all existing features work on mobile (chat, file uploads, settings, etc.)\n8) Test viewport meta tags and mobile browser compatibility\n9) Optimize for mobile performance (smaller assets, efficient DOM structure)\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test across different mobile screen sizes (phones, tablets), various mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox mobile), touch interactions, keyboard behavior, orientation changes, and ensure all desktop features work properly on mobile including file uploads, chat functionality, and any advanced features like the buddy system.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide the new mobile-mode.html file, demonstrate that all existing desktop features are preserved, show responsive behavior across different screen sizes, and verify performance optimizations are in place.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward web development task involving responsive design and mobile optimization of an existing interface.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the core requirement - creating a mobile-optimized version of the existing desktop interface. The approach is methodical, starting with analysis of the current implementation and moving through systematic mobile optimization steps. The plan correctly identifies key mobile considerations like touch interactions, responsive design, and performance optimization.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns with specificity and evidence collection:\n\n1. **Vague evidence criteria**: \"demonstrate that all existing desktop features are preserved\" and \"show responsive behavior\" lack concrete verification methods\n2. **Missing specific technical details**: No mention of how to verify performance improvements or what metrics will be used\n3. **Incomplete testing strategy**: While mobile browsers and screen sizes are mentioned, there's no specific plan for validating feature parity\n4. **File structure ambiguity**: Unclear if this creates a new file or modifies existing structure\n\nThe plan shows good technical understanding but lacks the precision needed for verifiable completion.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak - The proposed evidence is too general and doesn't provide concrete, measurable proof that all requirements have been met.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED (Go to planning)\n\nThe plan needs more specific evidence collection steps, concrete success criteria for performance and feature parity, and clearer verification methods for mobile optimization effectiveness."
