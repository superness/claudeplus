  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a complete spaceship game interface mockup for item crafting that includes competitive analysis, component-based crafting system, and high-quality glassy spaceship effects, designed to integrate into an existing menu system as a tab.\n\nAPPROACH: I'll research AAA game crafting interfaces, analyze the existing codebase structure, design a modular crafting system with realistic data models, and implement a polished UI with spaceship-themed visual effects.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA game crafting interfaces (Subnautica, No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen)\n2) Use Glob/Read tools to examine existing codebase structure and identify menu container patterns\n3) Design data models for items, components, and crafting recipes that can accept real data sources\n4) Create modular React components for crafting interface (item browser, recipe viewer, component tracker)\n5) Implement glassy spaceship UI effects using CSS animations and modern styling\n6) Build inventory management and crafting queue functionality\n7) Add responsive design and accessibility features\n8) Create mock data that demonstrates the system with realistic spaceship components\n9) Test integration patterns that allow dropping into existing menu containers\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various item types (weapons, ship parts, consumables), different component availability scenarios, complex multi-tier crafting recipes, responsive behavior across screen sizes, and integration with different container structures.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide competitive analysis documentation, working interactive mockup, clean modular code structure, demonstration of glassy visual effects, mock data examples, and integration guidelines.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This combines UI/UX design, competitive research, and technical implementation which are all within my capabilities. The modular approach ensures it can integrate with existing systems."
