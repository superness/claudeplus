    "design_specification": "Now I have all the necessary context. Let me create the comprehensive plan for building the performance_analyzer agent.\n\n---\n\n**UNDERSTANDING:** User wants me to design (NOT implement) a `performance_analyzer` agent based on section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent should analyze mining performance metrics including hashrate, share acceptance rate, block discovery time, identify bottlenecks, generate reports, and compare to expected values. The agent needs specific permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and must support 4 decisions (analysis_complete, performance_good, performance_issues, error). The final JSON will be written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/performance_analyzer.json`.\n\n**APPROACH:** I will design a comprehensive agent specification by:\n1. Analyzing the plan document section 2.3 (lines 356-376) to extract exact requirements\n2. Examining similar existing agents (mining_status_checker, performance_test_engineer, balance_analyzer, system_analyzer) to understand the expected JSON structure and system prompt patterns\n3. Defining mining-specific performance metrics and analysis criteria\n4. Creating decision tree logic for the 4 required decisions\n5. Structuring a detailed system prompt with execution workflow, metrics collection, analysis methodology, and reporting format\n6. Defining validation criteria and success metrics specific to mining performance\n\n**STEPS:**\n1. **Extract Requirements from Plan Document** - Review section 2.3 (lines 356-376) and identify all capabilities: calculate effective hashrate, measure share acceptance rate, track block discovery time, identify bottlenecks, generate performance reports, compare to expected values\n2. **Analyze Reference Agents** - Study mining_status_checker.json structure (comprehensive mining-specific prompts), performance_test_engineer.json (performance analysis patterns), balance_analyzer.json (simple structure), system_analyzer.json (analysis workflow patterns)\n3. **Define Performance Metrics** - List specific metrics to collect: hashrate (current vs expected), share acceptance rate (%), block discovery time (actual vs theoretical), pool latency, RPC response time, stratum job delivery time, resource utilization\n4. **Design Decision Tree** - Create logic for 4 decisions:\n   - `analysis_complete`: All metrics collected and analyzed successfully\n   - `performance_good`: Metrics within acceptable ranges (e.g., hashrate ≥90%, acceptance ≥95%, no bottlenecks)\n   - `performance_issues`: Metrics degraded but operational (e.g., hashrate 50-90%, acceptance 80-95%, minor bottlenecks)\n   - `error`: Cannot collect metrics or critical analysis failure\n5. **Structure System Prompt** - Build comprehensive prompt sections:\n   - Agent role and responsibilities\n   - Performance metrics definitions\n   - Data collection methodology using Bash, Grep, Read tools\n   - Calculation formulas (effective hashrate, acceptance rate, expected block time)\n   - Bottleneck identification techniques (CPU, network, RPC, stratum)\n   - Decision tree with specific thresholds\n   - Report generation format\n   - Execution workflow (collect → analyze → compare → identify issues → decide → report)\n6. **Define Validation Criteria** - Specify success criteria: hashrate measured, share stats analyzed, block timing tracked, bottlenecks identified, comparison to expected values, decision made, report generated\n7. **Create JSON Structure** - Assemble complete agent JSON with: id, name, role, expertise array, systemPrompt (multi-section detailed prompt), outputFormat (markdown), validationCriteria array, decisions array\n8. **Specify Tool Usage Patterns** - Document how to use permitted tools:\n   - Bash: Execute mining log analysis, process monitoring, network stats\n   - Grep: Search logs for hashrate, share submissions, block discoveries, errors\n   - Read: Read configuration files for expected values, mining logs\n   - Write: Generate performance reports\n   - Edit: Update configuration if needed\n   - Glob: Find log files across directories\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**\nThe agent design will handle these test scenarios:\n- **Optimal Performance**: All metrics at/above expected values → decision: `performance_good`\n- **Degraded Performance**: Metrics below optimal but still functional → decision: `performance_issues` with specific bottleneck identification\n- **Multiple Bottlenecks**: Network + CPU issues → report should identify all bottlenecks with priority ranking\n- **Missing Expected Values**: No baseline for comparison → use industry standards or warn in report\n- **Incomplete Logs**: Cannot find all metrics → decision: `error` with clear explanation\n- **Edge Cases**: Zero hashrate, 100% rejection, very long block times → proper categorization in decision tree\n- **Comparison Logic**: Handle percentage calculations, time conversions, statistical variance\n- **Report Completeness**: Ensure all sections populated even with partial data\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\nThe plan will include specifications for:\n- Complete JSON agent definition file structure\n- Detailed system prompt with 8+ major sections (role, metrics, collection, analysis, decision tree, reporting, workflow, examples)\n- Decision tree with specific numeric thresholds (e.g., hashrate ≥90% = good, 50-90% = issues, <50% = critical)\n- Metrics collection commands (specific Bash/Grep commands for mining logs)\n- Performance report template with sections: summary, metrics table, bottleneck analysis, recommendations, decision rationale\n- Tool usage examples for each permitted tool (Bash, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Glob)\n- Validation criteria array with 7+ specific items\n- Expertise array with 6+ mining performance domains\n- Reference to section 2.3 requirements verification checklist\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** High\n\n**Rationale for High Confidence:**\n- Clear requirements in section 2.3 of plan document (lines 356-376)\n- Strong reference agents available (especially mining_status_checker with comprehensive mining-specific prompts)\n- Well-defined performance metrics that are standard in mining operations\n- Straightforward decision tree with quantifiable thresholds\n- Task is design/planning (not implementation), which is well-suited for specification\n- All required components can be designed based on existing patterns and mining domain knowledge\n- The 4 decisions map clearly to analysis outcomes (complete, good, issues, error)\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",
    "design_review": "**ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThis plan demonstrates strong understanding of the requirements and provides a comprehensive design approach for the performance_analyzer agent. Let me evaluate the key aspects:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Requirements Extraction**: The plan correctly identifies section 2.3 (lines 356-376) as the source and lists all required capabilities (hashrate, share acceptance, block timing, bottlenecks, reporting)\n2. **Logical Methodology**: The 8-step approach is well-structured: extract requirements → study references → define metrics → design decision tree → structure prompt → validate → create JSON → document tool usage\n3. **Concrete Metrics Defined**: Specific performance indicators are listed (hashrate %, acceptance rate %, block discovery time, latency, RPC response time)\n4. **Decision Tree with Thresholds**: Numeric criteria provided (e.g., hashrate ≥90% = good, 50-90% = issues, <50% = critical)\n5. **Reference Analysis**: Plan leverages existing agents (mining_status_checker, system_analyzer) to ensure consistent structure\n6. **Tool Usage Clarity**: Each permitted tool (Bash, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Glob) has defined usage patterns\n7. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test scenarios identified (optimal, degraded, multiple bottlenecks, missing data, edge cases)\n\n**Verification of Requirements Coverage:**\n- ✅ Analyze mining performance and efficiency\n- ✅ Calculate effective hashrate (with formula and comparison)\n- ✅ Measure share acceptance rate (percentage calculation)\n- ✅ Track block discovery time (actual vs theoretical)\n- ✅ Identify bottlenecks (CPU, network, RPC, stratum)\n- ✅ Generate performance reports (template structure defined)\n- ✅ Compare to expected values (baseline comparison methodology)\n- ✅ 4 decisions mapped (analysis_complete, performance_good, performance_issues, error)\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n1. **Missing Implementation Details**: While the plan describes WHAT to include in the system prompt, it doesn't provide the ACTUAL text of the prompt sections - this is acceptable for a design phase\n2. **Threshold Justification**: The numeric thresholds (90%, 95%, etc.) are stated but not justified with mining industry standards - could be stronger\n3. **Bottleneck Detection**: Methodology is mentioned but specific diagnostic commands/patterns are not detailed in the plan\n\n**Evidence Specification:**\nThe plan promises to deliver:\n- ✅ Complete JSON structure specification\n- ✅ Detailed system prompt with 8+ sections\n- ✅ Decision tree with numeric thresholds\n- ✅ Metrics collection methodology\n- ✅ Performance report template\n- ✅ Tool usage examples for each tool\n- ✅ Validation criteria array (7+ items)\n- ✅ Expertise array (6+ domains)\n- ✅ Requirements verification checklist\n\nThese are **concrete, verifiable deliverables** that can be inspected in the final JSON.\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY:** Strong\n\nThe proposed evidence is specific and verifiable:\n- JSON file structure can be validated against schema\n- System prompt sections can be counted and reviewed for completeness\n- Decision thresholds can be checked for numeric specificity\n- Tool usage patterns can be tested for executability\n- Report template can be evaluated for coverage of required sections\n- The final output at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/performance_analyzer.json` will serve as tangible proof\n\nThe plan includes validation through test scenarios (optimal, degraded, error cases) which demonstrates thoughtfulness about real-world usage.\n\n**Minor Gaps:**\n- Could specify exact log file paths to search (e.g., `/var/log/mining/*.log`)\n- Could define expected value sources more precisely (config file locations)\n- Could specify report output location\n\nHowever, these are implementation details that can be addressed during development, not critical gaps in the design plan.\n\n**Confidence Justification Review:**\nThe \"High Confidence\" claim is **well-justified**:\n- Clear source document (section 2.3)\n- Multiple reference agents available\n- Standard mining metrics (well-understood domain)\n- Design task (not implementation)\n- Quantifiable decision criteria\n- Comprehensive test scenario coverage\n\n---\n\n**DECISION:** APPROVED\n\n**Reasoning:** This design plan demonstrates thorough understanding of requirements, provides a logical step-by-step approach with specific deliverables, and specifies concrete evidence (JSON structure, prompt sections, decision thresholds, tool patterns) that can be verified. The plan addresses all 7 stated requirements and maps them to the 4 required decisions with quantifiable thresholds. While some implementation details could be more granular, the design-level specification is sufficiently detailed to guide implementation and validate completion. The high confidence rating is appropriately justified.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
