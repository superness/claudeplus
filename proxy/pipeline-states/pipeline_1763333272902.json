Look for these console messages after double-tapping a location:\n- `🎯 Navigation target set:` - Confirms navigation command was created\n- `🔍 getNavigationCommand() returning:` - Shows what's being retrieved every second\n- `🚢 Ship.updateWithNavigation()` - Shows what the ship received\n- `🚢 Thrust vector being sent to physics:` - Shows calculated thrust vector\n- `🛑 NAVIGATION DEBUG:` - Shows why navigation isn't working (if it fails)\n\nThe debug logs will pinpoint exactly where the navigation command chain breaks.\n\nDECISION: execution_complete",
    "verify_bug": "## Evidence Analysis\n\nAfter reviewing all available evidence files, I need to make a verification decision.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\n**Evidence Files Analyzed:**\n1. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json` - WebSocket connection refused\n2. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332749906.json` - WebSocket connection refused\n3. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763333162727.json` - WebSocket timeout after connection\n4. `ship_movement_bug_execution_report.json` - WebSocket server not running\n5. `test-ship-movement-bug-gamerunner.js` - Test automation script (not executed)\n\n### Runtime Evidence Assessment\n\n**Critical Finding**: ❌ **No Runtime Evidence Captured**\n\nAll evidence files show **WebSocket connection failures** or **timeouts**:\n- Evidence file 1: `\"error\": \"connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765\"`\n- Evidence file 2: `\"error\": \"connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765\"`\n- Evidence file 3: WebSocket connected briefly then closed, test timed out\n- Execution report: `\"rootCause\": \"WebSocket automation server not running\"`\n\n**State Snapshots**: None captured\n- `stateSnapshots: []` in all files\n- No `getShipState` responses\n- No command/response logs from actual game execution\n\n**Commands Executed**: None\n- All evidence files show empty `commands: []` arrays\n- No throttle setting, no navigation commands, no ship state queries\n- Test infrastructure failed before any commands could be sent\n\n### Verification Analysis\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verification\": \"INCONCLUSIVE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"All reproduction attempts failed due to WebSocket automation infrastructure not being available. No runtime evidence was captured showing actual ship behavior, navigation commands, or physics updates.\",\n  \"evidenceAnalysis\": {\n    \"runtimeEvidencePresent\": false,\n    \"websocketResponses\": \"None - all connections refused or timed out\",\n    \"stateInconsistency\": \"Cannot assess - no state snapshots captured\",\n    \"matchesBugReport\": \"Cannot verify - bug requires runtime testing\",\n    \"infrastructureIssues\": [\n      \"WebSocket server not running on port 8765\",\n      \"TestingBrowserBridge not connected\",\n      \"No game state snapshots captured\",\n      \"Automation framework incomplete\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"nextSteps\": [\n    \"Alternative 1: Manual browser console testing using window.simulator\",\n    \"Alternative 2: Start WebSocket server and retry automated testing\",\n    \"Alternative 3: Direct code analysis with debug logging in browser DevTools\",\n    \"Alternative 4: Use browser's inspect element to verify ship position changes\"\n  ],\n  \"rootCause\": \"Cannot confirm bug existence without runtime evidence. The automation infrastructure (WebSocket server, game connection, command API) did not function during reproduction attempts.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Why This Is INCONCLUSIVE\n\nAccording to the verification requirements:\n\n**❌ ALWAYS RETURN \"INCONCLUSIVE\" IF:**\n- ✅ No WebSocket automation logs provided (all connection failures)\n- ✅ No evidence.json file from test execution (files exist but show errors, not test results)\n- ✅ No game state snapshots captured (all files show empty snapshots)\n- ✅ Only static code analysis (previous stage added debug logs but didn't run game)\n\n**The evidence shows:**\n- Test infrastructure failures, not bug confirmation\n- No actual game commands executed\n- No ship state before/after comparisons\n- No navigation target setting attempts\n- No throttle application tests\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\nSince WebSocket automation is unavailable, alternative approaches are needed:\n\n1. **Manual Browser Testing**: Open `index.html` in Chrome, open DevTools console, and manually test:\n   ```javascript\n   // Get ship position before\n   window.simulator.playerShip.position\n   \n   // Double-tap a location in space\n   // Observe if position changes\n   \n   // Check navigation state\n   window.simulator.inputManager.getNavigationCommand()\n   ```\n\n2. **Debug Log Review**: The previous stage added debug logging to `InputManager.js` and `Ship.js`. Load the game and check browser console for these logs when attempting to navigate.\n\n3. **Direct Physics Testing**: Use browser console to force movement:\n   ```javascript\n   window.simulator.playerShip.throttle = 1.0\n   // Wait a few seconds\n   // Check if position changed\n   ```\n\n---\n\n**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence - WebSocket automation infrastructure failed, cannot confirm bug without actual game execution data)"
