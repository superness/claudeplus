    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants to fix responsive layout issues in desktop-mode.html where content can overflow on mobile devices, causing bottom overflow issues depending on chat content and phone resolution. Need to optimize for mobile while preserving existing styling.\n\nAPPROACH: First examine the current HTML/CSS structure to understand layout mechanics, then identify overflow sources and implement mobile-responsive fixes using CSS viewport units, flexbox, and proper container sizing without breaking existing desktop styling.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read desktop-mode.html to understand current structure and styling\n2) Use Grep to search for CSS classes and layout-related styles across the codebase\n3) Identify container elements, chat areas, and input sections that could cause overflow\n4) Analyze current responsive design patterns and breakpoints\n5) Implement CSS fixes using viewport height (vh), flexible containers, and overflow handling\n6) Test layout adjustments to ensure desktop styling remains intact\n7) Verify mobile viewport meta tag and responsive design setup\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test scenarios including: long chat conversations, different mobile screen sizes (small phones to large tablets), various content types in chat (text, images, long messages), keyboard visibility on mobile, and orientation changes. Will ensure desktop layout remains unaffected.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide before/after code comparison, specific CSS changes made, and demonstrate how overflow issues are resolved while maintaining existing visual design integrity.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - responsive layout optimization is a well-established practice with clear CSS solutions for mobile overflow issues.",
    "review": "Perfect! I have successfully optimized the mobile layout for desktop-mode.html. Here's a summary of the key improvements made:\n\n## Mobile Layout Optimizations Completed\n\n**Core Issues Fixed:**\n1. **Dynamic Viewport Height**: Replaced fixed `100vh` with `100dvh` (with fallbacks) to handle mobile browser UI changes\n2. **Flexible Layout Structure**: Changed chat interface from fixed height calculations to flexible `flex: 1` approach\n3. **Consolidated Breakpoints**: Replaced multiple conflicting media queries with a single, well-tested `@media (max-width: 480px)` rule\n4. **Overflow Prevention**: Added proper `overflow: hidden` and `min-height: 0` to prevent content spillover\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- **Body & Viewport**: Now use `100dvh` with `100vh` fallbacks for broader browser support\n- **Main Container**: Uses flexible height with `flex: 1` and proper overflow control\n- **Chat Interface**: No longer uses fixed `calc(100vh - Xpx)` formulas, now fills available space dynamically\n- **Messages Container**: Optimized with `flex: 1` and smooth iOS scrolling\n- **Input Container**: Fixed height constraints with proper minimum touch targets\n- **Scout Elements**: Optimized sizing using `min()` function for responsive scaling\n\n**Browser Compatibility:**\n- Added CSS fallbacks for older browsers that don't support `dvh` units\n- Maintained existing functionality while improving mobile responsiveness\n- Preserved all original styling while fixing overflow issues\n\nThe layout will now adapt properly to different mobile screen sizes and orientations, preventing the bottom cutoff issues you were experiencing, while maintaining the visual integrity of your existing design."
