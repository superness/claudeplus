  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality, production-ready spaceship crafting interface mockup for a AAA game, featuring glassy spaceship effects, component-based crafting system, and modular design for integration into existing menu systems.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA game crafting interfaces, analyze design patterns, create a modern web-based mockup with glassmorphism effects, implement component hierarchy system, and ensure modular architecture for easy integration.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA spaceship/sci-fi game crafting interfaces (No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, etc.)\n2) Analyze common UI patterns, layouts, and user expectations from competitive research\n3) Create project structure with HTML/CSS/JS for the crafting interface mockup\n4) Design component hierarchy system (materials → components → final items)\n5) Implement glassmorphism effects with CSS (backdrop-filter, transparency, gradients)\n6) Create responsive layout that works as a modular tab/container\n7) Add interactive elements (drag-drop, hover effects, crafting simulation)\n8) Implement mock data structure that can be easily replaced with real APIs\n9) Add animations and transitions for premium feel\n10) Test interface responsiveness and usability\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various screen sizes, different crafting complexity levels (simple 2-component items vs complex multi-tier crafting), edge cases like insufficient materials, and integration scenarios within different container sizes.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working HTML/CSS/JS files, screenshots of the interface, demonstration of glassmorphism effects, mock data structure examples, and documentation showing how to integrate with existing systems.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined UI/UX task with clear deliverables. Web technologies are excellent for creating interactive mockups with modern visual effects, and there's abundant reference material from existing AAA games to inform design decisions."
