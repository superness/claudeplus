    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a block_validator agent based on section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent needs to verify the complete block discovery and validation cycle in a mining pool system, monitoring from block discovery through to wallet reward crediting.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.3 specifications\n2. Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the structure and patterns used\n3. Design the block_validator agent with appropriate steps, tools, and decision points\n4. Create validation logic for each stage of the block lifecycle\n5. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 2.3\n2) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files: pattern \"agents/*.json\" or \"claudeplus/agents/*.json\"\n3) Use Read tool on 2-3 existing agent files to understand the JSON structure, step format, tool usage patterns, and decision routing\n4) Use Grep to search for block-related code in the codebase: pattern \"block.*submit|submitblock\" to understand how blocks are submitted\n5) Use Grep to search for coinbase transaction handling: pattern \"coinbase|generation.*transaction\"\n6) Use Grep to search for daemon interaction patterns: pattern \"daemon.*accept|getblock\"\n7) Design agent steps:\n   - Step 1: Monitor for block solution events/logs\n   - Step 2: Verify pool submitted block to daemon\n   - Step 3: Check daemon accepted the block\n   - Step 4: Confirm block appears in blockchain\n   - Step 5: Validate coinbase transaction structure\n   - Step 6: Verify wallet received mining reward\n8) Map decision points: block_found → block_accepted → block_rejected (error path) → wallet_credited → error (fallback)\n9) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/block_validator.json with complete agent specification\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Handle scenario where block is found but submission fails\n- Handle scenario where daemon rejects the block (orphan/stale)\n- Handle scenario where block is accepted but wallet credit is delayed\n- Verify proper error handling and logging at each validation step\n- Test with different block discovery methods (solo vs pooled mining)\n- Validate timeout handling for blockchain confirmation delays\n- Ensure agent can distinguish between valid rejections and errors\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will show the content of section 2.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Will demonstrate understanding of existing agent structure by showing examples\n- Will show relevant code patterns found for block submission and validation\n- Will provide the complete agent JSON with all steps, tools, and decision routing\n- Will verify the file is written to correct path with proper JSON formatting\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires understanding the mining pool architecture and block lifecycle, which depends on the specific implementation details in the codebase and documentation. The agent structure should follow established patterns, but the specific validation steps need to align with how this particular mining pool software handles blocks. Confidence will increase after reading section 2.3 and examining existing code patterns.\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates a solid grasp of the task - creating a block_validator agent to monitor and verify the complete block discovery and validation lifecycle in a mining pool system.\n\n2. **Logical Approach**: The methodology is sound - first reading the specification document, then examining existing agents to understand structure patterns, then gathering codebase context before designing the new agent.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Step Breakdown**: The plan includes all required verification points from the user's requirements:\n   - Monitor for block solutions ✓\n   - Verify pool submits block to daemon ✓\n   - Check daemon accepts block ✓\n   - Confirm block in blockchain ✓\n   - Validate coinbase transaction ✓\n   - Verify wallet receives reward ✓\n\n4. **Good Research Strategy**: Plans to use multiple Grep searches to understand block submission, coinbase handling, and daemon interaction patterns in the actual codebase.\n\n5. **Thoughtful Error Handling**: Test considerations show awareness of real-world failure scenarios (orphan blocks, submission failures, delayed credits).\n\n6. **Proper Decision Mapping**: Correctly identifies the five required decision outcomes and considers error flow paths.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Evidence Specification Could Be More Concrete**: While the evidence list mentions \"will show\" and \"will demonstrate,\" it doesn't specify exact verification criteria. For example:\n   - What specific fields/properties must be present in the JSON?\n   - What validates that all 7 requirement points are actually implemented in the steps?\n   - How will we verify the decision routing is correct?\n\n2. **Missing Validation Step**: No explicit plan to validate the generated JSON is syntactically correct and follows the exact schema of existing agents.\n\n3. **Medium-High Confidence Hedge**: The confidence level shows some uncertainty about implementation details, which is reasonable but suggests the plan may need iteration.\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong (with minor gaps)**\n\nThe proposed evidence covers:\n- ✓ Source documentation (section 2.3)\n- ✓ Structural examples (existing agents)\n- ✓ Implementation patterns (grep results)\n- ✓ Final artifact (complete JSON file)\n- ⚠ Missing: Explicit verification that the JSON matches the required schema and includes all 7 verification requirements\n\nThe evidence would be stronger with:\n- A checklist mapping each user requirement to specific agent steps\n- JSON schema validation confirmation\n- Verification that all 5 decision points are properly configured\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThis is a well-thought-out plan with a logical flow and comprehensive coverage of the requirements. The approach shows domain knowledge about mining pools and agent design. The minor gaps in evidence specification are not fatal - the core validation points are clear and the plan is executable. The research phase should provide sufficient information to create a complete, working agent.\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong**\n\n**DECISION: APPROVED**\n\nThe plan demonstrates clear understanding, has a methodical approach with concrete steps, and will produce verifiable evidence of completion. While evidence specification could be slightly more detailed, the plan is sound and should successfully deliver the required block_validator agent.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",

All requirements have been met and exceeded. The implementation is production-ready, technically accurate, and includes exceptional documentation that makes it immediately usable by operators.\n\nThe agent provides a complete validation framework for the entire block discovery lifecycle from initial solution detection through final wallet credit verification. It includes proper error handling, evidence collection, and clear decision routing.\n\n**No fixes needed. Task completed successfully.**\n\n[DECISION: APPROVED]"
