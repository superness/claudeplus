    "planning": "**UNDERSTANDING:** \nUser wants to improve the readability and accessibility of the station UI manufacturing/crafting interface. Based on the screenshot analysis, the current nano-forge interface has small text (10px-12px font sizes), cramped spacing, and needs larger text and better use of space for users with lower resolution displays or eye strain issues.\n\n**APPROACH:**\n1. Analyze the current nano-forge interface implementation in StationUI.js (CraftingServiceUI class)\n2. Review the CSS styling in nano-forge.css to identify all font sizes, padding, spacing, and layout constraints\n3. Identify specific readability issues from the screenshot: blueprint labels, material lists, filter buttons, header text, console panels\n4. Create a comprehensive plan to increase font sizes (minimum 14px for body text, 16-18px for headers)\n5. Expand spacing/padding throughout the interface to reduce visual density\n6. Improve contrast ratios where needed for accessibility\n7. Adjust grid layouts to better utilize available space\n8. Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch/click targets (minimum 44px)\n\n**STEPS:**\n1. Read complete CraftingServiceUI class implementation (js/ui/StationUI.js:812-end of class) to understand the full HTML structure\n2. Read complete nano-forge.css file to catalog all current font sizes and spacing values\n3. Read nano-forge-redesign.css to check if there are additional styles that need updating\n4. Identify key problem areas:\n   - Blueprint vault labels (currently 10px)\n   - Material analyzer text (currently appears very small)\n   - Filter buttons (currently 10px)\n   - Header text (station designation, power grid status)\n   - Production bay text\n   - Hologram display labels\n5. Create modification plan with specific CSS changes:\n   - Increase all font sizes by 40-60% (10px → 14-16px, 12px → 16-18px)\n   - Increase padding on all containers (15px → 25px, 20px → 30px)\n   - Expand blueprint node sizing (currently minmax(150px, 1fr) → minmax(200px, 1fr))\n   - Increase material grid row heights\n   - Expand button heights and text sizes\n6. Modify CSS files to implement changes\n7. Test visual hierarchy - ensure important information stands out\n8. Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- Test on lower resolution displays (1366x768, 1920x1080)\n- Verify text is readable at 125% and 150% browser zoom\n- Check that all interactive elements are easily clickable (44px minimum)\n- Ensure blueprint names don't truncate with larger text\n- Verify material lists remain readable when showing multiple resources\n- Test with browser developer tools simulating vision deficiencies\n- Ensure layout doesn't break with expanded sizing\n- Verify scrollable areas still function correctly with larger content\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Side-by-side screenshots showing before/after font size increases\n- Specific CSS property changes with old vs new values documented\n- Measurements of font sizes, padding values, and interactive element dimensions\n- Visual comparison of text readability at different zoom levels\n- Line-by-line diffs of modified CSS files showing all accessibility improvements\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** \nHigh - This is a straightforward CSS accessibility enhancement task. The screenshot clearly shows the current UI issues (small text, cramped spacing), the code structure is well-organized with dedicated CSS files, and the required changes are well-defined: increase font sizes, expand padding/spacing, improve visual hierarchy. The nano-forge interface already has good semantic structure, it just needs better sizing for accessibility.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "**ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe plan demonstrates a strong understanding of the accessibility issues in the station UI manufacturing interface. The planner correctly identified the core problems from the screenshot: small font sizes (10-12px), cramped spacing, and poor readability for users with lower resolution or eye strain. The approach is methodical and well-structured.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear identification of specific UI elements needing improvement (blueprint labels, material lists, filter buttons, etc.)\n- Concrete sizing targets (14-16px body text, 16-18px headers, 44px minimum interactive elements)\n- Comprehensive scope covering font sizes, padding, spacing, grid layouts, and contrast ratios\n- Strong accessibility focus with WCAG AA standards mentioned\n- Logical step-by-step approach starting with code analysis before making changes\n- Testing considerations cover multiple scenarios (different resolutions, zoom levels, vision deficiencies)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The plan doesn't explicitly mention reading the screenshot file first (stationuiiteration.PNG) despite it being the primary requirement\n- Evidence section could be more specific about what metrics will prove the improvements (e.g., \"all body text verified to be minimum 14px\", \"all interactive elements measured at 44px+\")\n- Step 3 mentions \"nano-forge-redesign.css\" which may or may not exist - could waste time\n- No mention of how to validate changes in-browser (open station UI, navigate to crafting, etc.)\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong**\n\nThe proposed evidence is concrete and verifiable:\n- Side-by-side screenshots provide visual proof\n- CSS property change documentation shows exact values\n- Measurements of font sizes and dimensions are quantifiable\n- Line-by-line diffs provide complete audit trail\n- Testing at different zoom levels demonstrates accessibility compliance\n\nThe evidence would definitively prove whether the task was completed successfully. However, it could be strengthened by adding:\n- Specific font size measurements for each UI element type\n- Contrast ratio measurements for all text/background combinations\n- Screenshot annotations showing measurement callouts\n\n**DECISION: APPROVED (Plan approved, proceed to execution)**\n\nDespite minor gaps, the plan has:\n1. ✅ Clear understanding of accessibility improvements needed\n2. ✅ Logical approach (analyze → identify → plan → modify → test)\n3. ✅ Concrete evidence (screenshots, measurements, diffs)\n4. ✅ High confidence with good justification (straightforward CSS task, well-organized code)\n\nThe evidence collection is sufficient to verify completion, and the approach will successfully address the user's readability concerns.",
