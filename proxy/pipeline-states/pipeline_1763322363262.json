Open: file:///C:/github/superstarships/index.html\n2. Press F12 (DevTools)\n3. Copy inject_fitting_navigation_bug.js contents\n4. Paste in Console, press Enter\n5.

CRITICAL GAPS IN EVIDENCE\n\n**The reproduction sequence was NOT executed:**\n\nThe automation script (`inject_fitting_navigation_bug.js`) includes 12 steps:\n1. Dock at station\n2. Open fitting UI\n3. Fit afterburner\n4. Save fitting\n5. Undock\n6. Verify ship stats\n7. Test approach command\n8. Capture bug evidence\n\n**Evidence shows:**\n- ✗ No fitting UI visible in screenshots\n- ✗ No station docking sequence\n- ✗ No undocking sequence\n- ✗ No approach command execution\n- ✗ No `window.bugReproductionReport` captured\n\n**Screenshots show only:**\n- Game loaded in initial state\n- Ship in space (unknown if freshly spawned or post-undock)\n- Normal rendering (no crashes)\n\n---\n\n### 5. DETERMINATION\n\n**Cannot confirm bug existence because:**\n\n1. **Reproduction steps not executed** - The 12-step automation script was not injected into the browser, so the bug scenario (fit afterburner → undock → test navigation) was never performed\n\n2. **Missing critical evidence:**\n   - No console logs showing `maxVelocityCorrupted = true`\n   - No `window.bugReproductionReport` data\n   - No fitting UI interaction captured\n   - No undocking sequence captured\n   - No approach command test results\n\n3. **Contradictory visual evidence:**\n   - Radial HUD shows \"6 m/s\" velocity (not 0 m/s)\n   - This suggests ship IS moving, contradicting \"extremely slow/not at all\"\n   - However, 6 m/s could be abnormally slow for fitted ship (need baseline comparison)\n\n4. **No baseline comparison:**\n   - Don't know ship's normal max velocity\n   - Don't know if afterburner was ever fitted\n   - Don't know if 6 m/s is correct or corrupted value\n\n---\n\n### 6. EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\n| Evidence Type | Quality | Usability |\n|--------------|---------|-----------|\n| Screenshots | High | Low (no reproduction steps executed) |\n| Console Logs | None | None |\n| Automation Scripts | High | Not executed |\n| Execution Logs | Medium | Shows game loaded, not bug reproduced |\n| Performance Metrics | Low | No physics/navigation data |\n\n---\n\n## VERIFICATION OUTPUT\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verification\": \"INCONCLUSIVE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The bug reproduction sequence was never executed. Screenshots show the game loaded successfully, but there is no evidence that the critical steps (fit afterburner → undock → test navigation) were performed. The automation script exists but was not injected into the browser. Console logs were not captured. No window.bugReproductionReport data is available. The visual evidence shows a ship moving at 6 m/s, which contradicts the 'extremely slow/0% throttle' bug description, but we cannot confirm if this is post-fitting state or initial spawn state.\",\n  \n  \"evidenceAnalysis\": {\n    \"screenshots\": \"Shows game loaded with ship at 6 m/s velocity - no fitting UI visible, cannot confirm dock/undock status, no throttle display visible, contradicts '0% throttle' claim but lacks context for whether 6 m/s is normal or corrupted\",\n    \"consoleLogs\": \"NOT CAPTURED - No error messages, no bugReproductionReport, no maxVelocityCorrupted status, no execution confirmation\",\n    \"behaviorObserved\": \"Game loaded successfully, ship rendering at 6 m/s, no visible crashes or UI errors, but NO EVIDENCE of reproduction steps being executed (no fitting, no undocking, no approach test)\",\n    \"automationScripts\": \"Created but NOT EXECUTED - Scripts ready for manual injection but no confirmation they ran\"\n  },\n  \n  \"matchesReport\": false,\n  \"confidence\": 0.15,\n  \"confidenceReasoning\": \"Very low confidence. The evidence does not match the bug report because the reproduction steps were not executed. Cannot confirm or deny bug existence with current evidence.\",\n  \n  \"nextSteps\": \"REQUIRED: Execute manual reproduction before proceeding to root cause analysis. Investigator must: (1) Open game in Chrome, (2) Open DevTools Console (F12), (3) Paste inject_fitting_navigation_bug.js, (4) Execute script, (5) Examine window.bugReproductionReport.maxVelocityCorrupted status. If TRUE → proceed to root cause. If FALSE → bug not reproduced. If script fails → need different reproduction approach.\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATION\n\n**DO NOT proceed to root cause analysis yet.**\n\n**Required actions before verification:**\n\n1. **Execute the reproduction script manually:**\n   ```bash\n   # Open in Chrome\n   file:///C:/github/superstarships/index.html\n   \n   # Press F12 → Console tab\n   # Paste inject_fitting_navigation_bug.js\n   # Execute and wait for report\n   ```\n\n2. **Capture the verification data:**\n   - Screenshot of console with `window.bugReproductionReport`\n   - Value of `maxVelocityCorrupted` (true/false)\n   - Before/after `maxVelocity` values\n   - Approach command test results\n\n3. **Re-run verification with complete evidence:**\n   - If `maxVelocityCorrupted = true` → **BUG_CONFIRMED**\n   - If `maxVelocityCorrupted = false` → **NOT_REPRODUCED**\n   - If script crashes → **INCONCLUSIVE** (need different approach)\n\n---\n\n**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**\n\n*Reason: Reproduction steps were not executed. Cannot verify bug existence without completing the fit afterburner → undock → test navigation sequence. Manual script injection required to gather definitive evidence.*"
