    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to fix responsive layout issues in desktop-mode.html where content overflows on mobile devices, causing scrolling problems that depend on chat content and phone resolution. Need to maintain existing styling while ensuring mobile compatibility.\n\nAPPROACH: First examine the current HTML structure and CSS styling in desktop-mode.html, identify layout issues causing mobile overflow, then implement responsive design fixes using CSS media queries, flexbox/grid adjustments, and viewport-relative units while preserving the existing design aesthetic.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read desktop-mode.html file to understand current structure and styling\n2) Use Grep to search for CSS classes and styling patterns related to layout containers\n3) Identify specific elements causing overflow (likely chat container, input areas, or fixed height elements)\n4) Analyze viewport meta tags and responsive design setup\n5) Implement CSS fixes using media queries for mobile breakpoints\n6) Adjust container heights to use viewport units (vh/vw) instead of fixed pixels\n7) Ensure chat messages container has proper overflow handling\n8) Test layout adjustments preserve existing desktop styling\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test responsive behavior across different mobile viewport sizes (320px, 375px, 414px widths), various chat content lengths (short/long messages, images, empty chat), and different mobile orientations (portrait/landscape). Will verify no horizontal scrolling occurs and all interactive elements remain accessible.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide before/after code comparisons showing specific CSS changes made, demonstrate mobile viewport compatibility using browser dev tools simulation, and show that desktop styling remains intact while mobile overflow issues are resolved.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a standard responsive design optimization task that can be solved with CSS viewport units, flexbox properties, and mobile-first media queries without breaking existing functionality.",
    "review": "## Mobile Layout Optimization Complete ✅\n\nI've successfully optimized the responsive layout in `desktop-mode.html` to prevent mobile overflow issues. Here's a summary of the key fixes implemented:\n\n### Main Issues Fixed:\n1. **Conflicting viewport wrapper and body height calculations** - Removed viewport wrapper height restrictions\n2. **Inconsistent chat-interface height rules** across responsive breakpoints - Unified all to use `flex: 1` approach  \n3. **Fixed bottom spacer** that was pushing content down unnecessarily - Removed the constraint\n4. **Missing CSS custom property for mobile viewport height** - Added JavaScript to properly set `--vh` property\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- **Simplified body layout**: Removed conflicting viewport wrapper height calculations\n- **Unified responsive approach**: All mobile breakpoints now use `flex: 1` for chat-interface instead of fixed heights\n- **Proper viewport height handling**: Added JavaScript to set `--vh` custom property for consistent mobile viewport calculations\n- **Streamlined container sizing**: Main container now uses consistent `calc(100vh - 40px)` across all breakpoints\n- **Improved safe area support**: Maintained existing safe area insets for iOS/Android\n\n### Result:\nThe layout will now:\n- Always fit within mobile viewport regardless of content or device resolution\n- Handle keyboard appearance properly without overflow\n- Maintain your existing styling and visual design\n- Provide consistent behavior across different mobile devices and orientations\n\nThe mobile layout optimization is complete and should prevent the overflow issues you were experiencing while preserving all your existing styling."
