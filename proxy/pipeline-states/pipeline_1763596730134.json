    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the pool_server_manager agent that will manage CoiniumServ mining pool software from WSL to Windows, based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This includes launching, monitoring, and managing the pool server process across WSL/Windows boundaries.\n\nAPPROACH: First, I'll read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 requirements. Then I'll examine the existing codebase to locate CoiniumServ executable paths, understand the config structure, and identify any existing configuration files. I'll design the agent JSON structure with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision points (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error) that can handle cross-platform execution and monitoring.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications\n2) Use Glob tool to locate CoiniumServ executable (search patterns: \"**/CoiniumServ.exe\", \"**/bin/**/*.exe\")\n3) Use Read tool to examine existing config examples (build/bin/Debug/config/config.json, build/bin/Debug/config/config-example.json)\n4) Use Grep tool to search for any existing pool management scripts or launch configurations\n5) Design agent JSON with:\n   - Instructions for cross-platform WSL→Windows execution\n   - Tool permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep\n   - Decision points: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error\n   - Context about CoiniumServ paths, config generation, process monitoring\n6) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Will verify the agent can locate CoiniumServ.exe in multiple possible locations (Debug/Release builds)\n- Will ensure config.json generation handles both default and custom pool configurations\n- Will test WSL→Windows process execution with proper path translation (e.g., /mnt/c/... to C:\\...)\n- Will validate process monitoring can detect running/stopped states\n- Will handle scenarios where CoiniumServ fails to start or crashes\n- Will test log parsing for pool initialization, errors, and successful operation\n- Will verify graceful shutdown commands work correctly\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1\n- Located paths to CoiniumServ.exe\n- Structure of existing config.json files\n- Complete agent JSON specification showing all required capabilities\n- Example Bash commands for WSL→Windows execution (e.g., cmd.exe /c, powershell.exe)\n- Log file paths and parsing patterns\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - While I can read the plan document and existing configs, the WSL→Windows cross-platform process management adds complexity. The success depends on understanding the exact CoiniumServ launch requirements and ensuring the agent has proper context for path translation and process monitoring across the WSL/Windows boundary.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the requirements and includes a methodical approach to building the pool_server_manager agent. The plan correctly identifies the need to:\n- Read the source specification document (MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1)\n- Locate the CoiniumServ executable in the codebase\n- Examine existing configuration files\n- Handle WSL→Windows cross-platform execution complexities\n- Create a complete agent JSON with proper tool permissions and decision points\n\nThe step-by-step approach is logical and sequential, starting with information gathering (reading docs, locating files) before proceeding to agent design and creation. The plan acknowledges the complexity of WSL→Windows process management, which shows appropriate awareness of potential challenges.\n\nThe test considerations are comprehensive and cover important scenarios:\n- Multiple executable locations (Debug/Release)\n- Config generation flexibility\n- Path translation between WSL and Windows\n- Process state monitoring\n- Error handling and crash scenarios\n- Log parsing capabilities\n- Graceful shutdown\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**\n\nThe proposed evidence is concrete and verifiable:\n1. **Documentation evidence**: Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 - can be verified by reading the file\n2. **Executable location**: Specific paths to CoiniumServ.exe - can be verified via file system\n3. **Configuration structure**: Existing config.json format - can be verified by examining files\n4. **Deliverable**: Complete agent JSON at specified path - can be verified by reading the created file\n5. **Technical examples**: WSL→Windows execution commands and log patterns - can be validated against actual usage\n\nThe evidence clearly demonstrates completion criteria: if the agent JSON exists at the specified path with all required components (tools, decisions, instructions for cross-platform execution, config generation, monitoring, and shutdown), the task is verifiably complete.\n\nCONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: The \"Medium\" confidence rating is appropriately cautious given the cross-platform complexity. The reasoning is sound - the planner acknowledges uncertainty around CoiniumServ's exact launch requirements and path translation mechanics, which are implementation details that may require iteration.\n\n**Minor Concerns**:\n- The plan doesn't explicitly mention examining CoiniumServ documentation or command-line arguments (though this may be implicit in examining configs)\n- No mention of checking if other agents exist in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ to understand the JSON structure format (though the requirements are clear enough)\n\nThese are minor gaps that don't fundamentally undermine the plan's viability.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",

Let me create a summary of what was built:\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully created the **pool_server_manager agent** based on section 2.1 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md.
