    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to fix mobile responsive layout issues in desktop-mode.html where content can overflow at the bottom depending on chat content and phone resolution, while preserving existing styling.\n\nAPPROACH: I'll analyze the current HTML/CSS structure in desktop-mode.html, identify overflow issues in the mobile layout, and implement responsive fixes using CSS flexbox/grid and viewport units to ensure proper fitting on all mobile devices.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/ai-assistant/www/src/desktop-mode.html structure and styling\n2) Use Grep tool to search for CSS classes and mobile-specific styles in the file\n3) Analyze the chat container, input areas, and layout components that could cause overflow\n4) Identify current responsive breakpoints and mobile CSS rules\n5) Create CSS modifications using viewport height (vh), flexbox, or grid to prevent bottom overflow\n6) Use Edit tool to implement responsive layout fixes that maintain existing visual design\n7) Test considerations: Verify layout works with long chat histories, different screen sizes, and various content types\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will address scenarios with long chat conversations, different mobile screen resolutions (small phones to tablets), varying content types (text, images), keyboard open/closed states, and different viewport orientations (portrait/landscape).\n\nEVIDENCE: Will show before/after HTML structure, specific CSS changes made, and demonstrate how the new layout prevents overflow while maintaining the original styling aesthetic.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - Responsive layout fixes require careful CSS analysis and testing across different scenarios, but the task is well-defined and achievable with proper viewport and flexbox techniques."
