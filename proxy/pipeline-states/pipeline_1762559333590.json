    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a mobile-first version of the desktop-mode.html chat interface that provides an optimal responsive experience for mobile devices (phones/tablets), prioritizing mobile UX patterns over desktop ones.\n\nAPPROACH: First examine the existing desktop-mode.html structure, styles, and functionality. Then analyze what mobile-specific optimizations are needed (touch interactions, viewport handling, flexible layouts, mobile navigation patterns). Create a new mobile-optimized version or refactor the existing one with mobile-first CSS and UI patterns.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read desktop-mode.html to understand current structure, features, and layout\n2) Read desktop-renderer.js to understand JavaScript functionality and interactions\n3) Check if there are existing CSS files or styles that need to be analyzed\n4) Identify mobile-specific pain points from git history (recent commits mention mobile UI cutoff and overflow issues)\n5) Research mobile-first design patterns for chat interfaces (flexible layouts, touch-friendly controls, proper viewport configuration)\n6) Plan the mobile-first structure with:\n   - Proper viewport meta tags\n   - Mobile-first CSS (min-width media queries instead of max-width)\n   - Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px tap targets)\n   - Flexible/fluid layouts using flexbox/grid\n   - Safe area handling for notched devices\n   - Fixed input positioning to prevent keyboard cutoff\n   - Optimized message container scrolling\n7) Create implementation plan for new mobile.html or refactored desktop-mode.html\n8) Document responsive breakpoints and mobile-specific features\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Test on various screen sizes (small phones 320px, standard phones 375px/414px, tablets 768px+)\n- Test with device keyboards open (Android/iOS) to ensure input stays visible\n- Test with images in chat history (previous bug mentioned in git log)\n- Test touch interactions (scrolling, button taps, dragging if applicable)\n- Test in both portrait and landscape orientations\n- Test on devices with notches/safe areas\n- Verify no horizontal scrolling on narrow screens\n- Test message overflow with long text/code blocks\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Show side-by-side comparison of desktop-mode.html vs new mobile version\n- Demonstrate responsive behavior at key breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px)\n- Show viewport meta tag configuration\n- Show CSS media query structure (mobile-first approach)\n- Demonstrate touch target sizes meet accessibility standards\n- Show how keyboard interaction is handled (input stays visible)\n- Provide screenshots/examples of fixed layout issues from git history\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined UI/UX refactoring task. The git history shows recent mobile layout fixes were attempted, indicating existing pain points. Creating a mobile-first version requires examining existing code, applying responsive design best practices, and testing across breakpoints - all straightforward frontend development tasks.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: \nThe plan demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the task. It correctly identifies the need to:\n- Examine existing desktop-mode.html structure and functionality\n- Address known mobile UI issues (cutoff, overflow) visible in git history\n- Apply mobile-first design principles (viewport meta, min-width queries, touch targets)\n- Handle mobile-specific challenges (keyboards, safe areas, scrolling)\n\nThe approach is methodical and logical, progressing from analysis to planning to implementation. The plan specifically acknowledges recent git commits about mobile UI fixes, showing awareness of existing pain points.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n✓ Clear step-by-step approach starting with code analysis\n✓ Comprehensive mobile-first considerations (viewport, touch targets, safe areas, keyboard handling)\n✓ Specific technical requirements (44x44px tap targets, flexbox/grid, proper meta tags)\n✓ Thorough test considerations covering multiple devices, orientations, and edge cases\n✓ References concrete git history showing known mobile issues\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe evidence section is exceptionally detailed and verifiable:\n- Side-by-side comparisons (can be demonstrated via screenshots)\n- Responsive behavior at specific breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px - concrete measurements)\n- Viewport meta tag configuration (inspectable in code)\n- CSS media query structure (verifiable in source)\n- Touch target size compliance (measurable)\n- Keyboard interaction handling (testable)\n- Visual proof of fixed layout issues\n\nEach evidence item is concrete and can be objectively verified through code inspection, browser DevTools, or visual demonstration.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\nMinor: The plan doesn't specify whether this will be a new file (mobile.html) or refactoring desktop-mode.html, but this is an implementation detail that can be decided during execution.\n\nCONFIDENCE JUSTIFICATION: \nThe \"High\" confidence rating is appropriate because:\n1. Frontend responsive design is a well-established discipline with clear best practices\n2. The existing codebase provides a working foundation to build upon\n3. Git history confirms specific mobile issues that need addressing\n4. Success criteria are measurable and testable\n\nDECISION: APPROVED (Go to execution)"
