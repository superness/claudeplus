    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to optimize the responsive layout of desktop-mode.html to prevent overflow issues on mobile devices while preserving existing styling. The current layout sometimes overflows vertically depending on chat content and phone resolution.\n\nAPPROACH: I will examine the current HTML structure and CSS styling in desktop-mode.html, identify layout issues causing mobile overflow, and implement responsive design improvements using CSS flexbox/grid and viewport units while maintaining the existing visual design.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read desktop-mode.html to understand current HTML structure and CSS styling\n2) Analyze the layout components (header, chat container, input area, etc.) and their current sizing\n3) Identify specific overflow causes (fixed heights, inadequate viewport handling, content expansion)\n4) Research mobile viewport best practices for chat interfaces\n5) Implement CSS modifications using flexible units (vh, vw, flex) and responsive techniques\n6) Add/modify media queries for mobile optimization\n7) Test layout responsiveness considerations in the modifications\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will address various mobile screen sizes (small phones 320px to large phones 428px), different chat content lengths (short messages vs long conversations), keyboard appearance/disappearance on mobile, and portrait/landscape orientations. Will ensure the layout adapts to content without breaking container bounds.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide before/after code comparisons showing the specific CSS changes made, explain how each change addresses overflow issues, and demonstrate that existing styling patterns are preserved while adding responsive behavior.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined CSS/responsive design task with clear success criteria (no mobile overflow while preserving styling).",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a solid understanding of responsive design optimization for mobile overflow issues. The approach is systematic, starting with code analysis and moving through logical implementation steps. The plan correctly identifies key technical elements (flexbox/grid, viewport units, media queries) and shows awareness of real-world constraints like preserving existing styling.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in specificity and evidence collection:\n- Step 4 (\"Research mobile viewport best practices\") is vague and doesn't specify how this research will inform concrete changes\n- The evidence section lacks specificity about what concrete metrics or demonstrations will prove the overflow is actually fixed\n- No mention of how the success will be verified beyond code comparisons\n- Missing specific mention of testing the actual overflow scenarios that currently exist\n\nThe plan shows good technical understanding but could be more precise about measurable success criteria.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak - While code comparisons are mentioned, there's no concrete plan to demonstrate that the overflow issues are actually resolved through testing or visual verification. The evidence focuses on explaining changes rather than proving the problem is solved.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED - The plan lacks specific, verifiable evidence that the mobile overflow issues will be definitively resolved. Need concrete testing methodology and measurable success criteria beyond just code changes.",
    "execution": "I cannot execute this plan because it was **REJECTED** in the review stage. The review identified that the plan lacks specific, verifiable evidence and concrete testing methodology to prove the mobile overflow issues will be resolved.\n\nTo proceed, you need to either:\n\n1. **Revise the plan** to address the review feedback by adding:\n   - Specific testing methodology for mobile overflow scenarios\n   - Measurable success criteria beyond code changes\n   - Concrete demonstration methods to verify the overflow is actually fixed\n   - Clear evidence collection approach with visual verification\n\n2. **Create a new plan** that focuses on verifiable evidence and testing rather than just code implementation\n\nThe review specifically noted the plan was too focused on code changes without proving the problem would actually be solved. Would you like me to help create a revised plan that addresses these concerns?"
