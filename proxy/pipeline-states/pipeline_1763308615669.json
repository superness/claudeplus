    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a completely redesigned ship fitting UI accessible from stations, with AAA-quality visuals featuring quantum/magical space themes, intuitive UX, smooth interactions, and exceptional functionality. This should be a premium, polished experience that fits the quantum universe aesthetic.\n\nAPPROACH: I will plan a comprehensive UI redesign that:\n1. Analyzes the existing ship fitting system architecture\n2. Designs a quantum-themed visual language with modern UI/UX patterns\n3. Creates an interactive, animated interface with smooth transitions\n4. Implements drag-and-drop, visual feedback, and accessibility features\n5. Integrates quantum universe lore and aesthetics (consciousness, multi-dimensional themes)\n6. Ensures mobile-friendly responsive design\n7. Optimizes performance for smooth 60fps interactions\n\nSTEPS:\n1) **Analyze Current System**: Read `js/ui/ShipFittingUI.js` and `js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js` to understand existing fitting mechanics, constraints, and data structures\n2) **Review Integration Points**: Read `js/ui/StationUI.js` to understand how fitting UI is accessed from stations\n3) **Study Quantum Aesthetics**: Review `css/quantum-navigation.css`, `css/quantum-dock.css`, `css/nano-forge.css` to understand existing quantum visual language\n4) **Design Visual System**: Create new CSS file (`css/quantum-ship-fitting.css`) with:\n   - Quantum particle effects and glowing borders\n   - Holographic glass-morphism panels\n   - Animated slot highlights and energy flows\n   - Color-coded module categories (weapons, defense, engineering, quantum)\n   - Smooth transitions and hover states\n5) **Create Enhanced UI Component** (`js/ui/QuantumShipFittingUI.js`):\n   - 3D ship visualization in center with rotating hologram effect\n   - Radial or grid-based module slot layout around ship\n   - Real-time power/CPU bars with quantum energy visualization\n   - Module library with search, filters, and sorting\n   - Drag-and-drop with visual feedback (glowing trails, snap-to-slot)\n   - Comparison tooltips showing stat changes\n   - Save/load fitting configurations\n   - Integration with quantum lore (consciousness-enhanced modules, etc.)\n6) **Implement Smooth Interactions**:\n   - CSS transitions for all state changes\n   - Particle effects for module installation/removal\n   - Sound design hooks (optional audio feedback)\n   - Haptic feedback for mobile (vibration API)\n   - Smooth scrolling and panel animations\n7) **Add Advanced Features**:\n   - Auto-fit suggestions based on ship role\n   - Module damage/heat visualization\n   - Real-time DPS/tank calculations with visual graphs\n   - Fitting validation with helpful error messages\n   - Import/export fitting codes\n8) **Integrate with Station UI**: Modify `js/ui/StationUI.js` to launch quantum fitting UI with smooth transition animation\n9) **Create Responsive Layout**: Ensure UI works on mobile with touch-optimized controls\n10) **Performance Optimization**: Use RequestAnimationFrame for animations, lazy-load module icons, optimize re-renders\n11) **Testing**: Create standalone test file (`test-quantum-ship-fitting.html`) for UI development and iteration\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- **Mobile Touch**: Will test drag-and-drop with touch events, ensure buttons are finger-sized (44px minimum)\n- **Performance**: Will test with large module libraries (100+ items) to ensure smooth scrolling and filtering\n- **Edge Cases**: Empty slots, invalid fittings (CPU/power exceeded), locked modules, different ship classes\n- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, high-contrast mode support\n- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop and mobile)\n- **Integration**: Test launching from StationUI, saving/loading fittings, interaction with existing ShipFittingManager\n- **Visual Consistency**: Ensure quantum aesthetic matches existing quantum UI elements (navigation, dock, forge)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Complete new UI component file with comprehensive JSDoc comments\n- New CSS file with quantum-themed styles and animations\n- Modified StationUI.js showing integration\n- Standalone test HTML file demonstrating all features\n- Before/after comparison showing UX improvements\n- Performance metrics (FPS during interactions, load times)\n- Screenshots/descriptions of visual design elements\n- Code comments explaining quantum aesthetic choices\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - I have access to existing UI systems, quantum design patterns in the codebase, and clear requirements. The project already has strong UI foundations (RadialHUD, StationUI, existing fitting system) and quantum visual language (quantum-navigation, nano-forge styles). This is a creative enhancement task with well-defined technical constraints (CPU/power fitting system, station integration). The main challenge is balancing visual polish with performance, which is addressable through optimization techniques already used in the codebase.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Shows comprehensive understanding of the user's request for a modern, quantum-themed AAA ship fitting UI\n- Demonstrates awareness of existing codebase architecture (ShipFittingUI.js, ShipFittingManager.js, StationUI.js)\n- References existing quantum visual language (quantum-navigation.css, nano-forge.css) for design consistency\n- Includes concrete technical approach (new CSS file, new UI component, station integration)\n- Addresses performance, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility\n- Specifies standalone test file for development iteration\n- Plans for smooth animations, drag-and-drop, visual feedback - matching \"intuitive and smooth\" requirement\n\n**Specific Evidence Quality:**\nThe plan specifies multiple concrete deliverables:\n- ✅ New `js/ui/QuantumShipFittingUI.js` file (verifiable)\n- ✅ New `css/quantum-ship-fitting.css` file (verifiable)\n- ✅ Modified `js/ui/StationUI.js` with integration code (verifiable)\n- ✅ Standalone test file `test-quantum-ship-fitting.html` (verifiable)\n- ✅ Performance metrics (FPS, load times - measurable)\n- ✅ Visual design elements described in code/CSS (verifiable through code review)\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- \"Screenshots/descriptions\" is slightly vague - but the test HTML file addresses this\n- The scope is large (11 steps) but well-organized and logical\n- User emphasized \"have FUN painting a masterpiece\" - plan focuses heavily on technical execution but shows creative vision (holographic effects, particle animations, quantum energy visualization)\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\nThe approach follows a sound sequence:\n1. Understand existing system (steps 1-3) ✓\n2. Design visual language (step 4) ✓\n3. Build core component (step 5) ✓\n4. Add polish/interactions (steps 6-7) ✓\n5. Integrate and optimize (steps 8-10) ✓\n6. Test thoroughly (step 11) ✓\n\n**Test Coverage:**\nExcellent test considerations covering:\n- Mobile/touch interactions\n- Performance with scale\n- Edge cases and validation\n- Accessibility\n- Browser compatibility\n- Integration points\n- Visual consistency\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe plan provides multiple concrete, verifiable deliverables (new files, modified files, test file, measurable performance metrics). The standalone test HTML file will provide visual proof of the \"masterpiece experience.\" Code review of CSS/JS files will verify quantum aesthetic implementation. The evidence is specific, measurable, and directly tied to requirements.\n\n**Confidence Justification:**\nHigh confidence is well-justified - planner has identified:\n- Existing fitting system mechanics to build upon\n- Established quantum visual patterns to extend\n- Clear technical constraints (CPU/power system)\n- Proven UI patterns in codebase (RadialHUD, StationUI)\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
