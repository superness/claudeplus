    "design_specification": "Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to create a comprehensive plan. Let me create the plan for building the job_validator agent.\n\n---\n\n**UNDERSTANDING:** The user wants me to create a complete plan for building the `job_validator` agent based on section 2.3 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will verify that miners receive valid jobs from the pool by monitoring stratum job broadcasts, parsing job parameters, validating difficulty, checking merkle branches, verifying timestamps, and detecting job updates.\n\n**APPROACH:** I will design the job_validator agent JSON following the established structure seen in bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and block_validator.json. The agent will focus on the stratum protocol's job notification mechanism, which is part of the pool-to-miner communication. I'll need to specify monitoring capabilities, validation logic, decision keywords, and comprehensive stratum job validation procedures.\n\n**STEPS:**\n1. **Read section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md** (lines 258-281) - Already completed\n2. **Analyze existing agent structures** - Review bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and block_validator.json to understand JSON schema (Already completed)\n3. **Research stratum protocol job structure** - Document required job fields: job_id, prevhash, coinb1, coinb2, merkle_branch, version, nbits, ntime, clean_jobs\n4. **Design systemPrompt content** covering:\n   - Stratum protocol job notification format (`mining.notify`)\n   - Job parameter parsing and validation\n   - Difficulty calculation from nbits field\n   - Merkle branch validation logic\n   - Timestamp verification rules\n   - Job update detection mechanisms\n   - Network packet capture techniques (tcpdump, wireshark)\n   - Log monitoring for pool stratum output\n5. **Define expertise areas**: Stratum protocol, job validation, merkle tree structures, difficulty calculations, network monitoring\n6. **Specify required tools**: Bash (for tcpdump, netcat), Read (for log files), Grep (for pattern matching), Write (for job capture output)\n7. **Define decision keywords**: job_received, job_valid, job_invalid, no_jobs, error (as specified in requirements)\n8. **Create validation criteria**: Jobs captured correctly, all required fields present, difficulty appropriate, merkle branches valid, timestamps within range, job updates detected\n9. **Add configuration section** with: stratum port (3333), monitoring duration, expected job update interval, validation thresholds\n10. **Structure complete JSON** following the established pattern with all sections\n11. **Write JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/job_validator.json**\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nThe plan will ensure the agent can handle these test scenarios:\n\n1. **Normal operation**: Miner connects to pool, receives valid jobs with all required fields\n2. **Missing job parameters**: Detect when jobs are missing version, prevhash, coinbase, merkle branches, or other critical fields\n3. **Invalid difficulty**: Identify jobs with incorrect nbits values or difficulty targets\n4. **Corrupted merkle branches**: Validate merkle branch arrays are properly formatted\n5. **Timestamp issues**: Detect jobs with timestamps too far in past/future\n6. **No jobs scenario**: Handle case where miner connects but receives no jobs (pool issue)\n7. **Job update detection**: Recognize when new blocks trigger job updates (clean_jobs=true)\n8. **Rapid job changes**: Handle multiple job notifications in quick succession\n9. **Network capture failures**: Gracefully handle tcpdump errors or permission issues\n10. **Log parsing edge cases**: Deal with various pool log formats and stratum implementations\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\nThe plan will specify collection of:\n\n1. **Raw stratum job JSON** - Captured from network traffic or pool logs showing complete mining.notify messages\n2. **Parsed job parameters** - Extracted and formatted: job_id, prevhash, coinb1, coinb2, merkle_branch array, version, nbits, ntime, clean_jobs flag\n3. **Validation results** - For each field: pass/fail status with specific values\n4. **Difficulty calculations** - Computed target from nbits, compared to expected regtest difficulty\n5. **Merkle branch analysis** - Array length, hash format validation, branch completeness\n6. **Timestamp verification** - Job ntime value, comparison to current time, acceptable range check\n7. **Job update timeline** - Sequence of jobs received, timing between updates, clean_jobs flag changes\n8. **Network capture logs** - tcpdump output or wireshark traces showing stratum traffic\n9. **Pool log excerpts** - Relevant lines showing job broadcasts from pool perspective\n10. **Error conditions** - Any validation failures with specific reasons and field values\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** High\n\n**Reasoning for high confidence:**\n- Section 2.3 of the plan document provides clear requirements and success criteria\n- Existing agent examples demonstrate the JSON structure and systemPrompt format\n- Stratum protocol is well-documented with clear job notification format\n- Job validation requirements are specific and testable (version, prevhash, difficulty, merkle, timestamps)\n- Decision keywords are explicitly provided in requirements\n- Similar validation agents (share_validator, block_validator) exist as reference\n- Tools needed (Bash, Read, Grep, Write) are straightforward for this task\n- Monitoring techniques (tcpdump, log parsing) are standard approaches\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of the stratum mining protocol, job notification format, and validation requirements. The designer correctly identifies the key components (mining.notify messages, job parameters, merkle branches, difficulty calculations).\n\n2. **Logical Structure**: The 11-step approach follows a sound progression from reading requirements → analyzing existing patterns → researching protocols → designing components → implementation. This mirrors the successful pattern from previous agents.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The 10 test scenarios are excellent, covering normal operation, edge cases (missing parameters, corrupted data), error conditions (no jobs, network failures), and real-world scenarios (rapid job changes, various pool implementations).\n\n4. **Appropriate Tooling**: The specified tools (Bash for tcpdump/netcat, Read for logs, Grep for parsing, Write for output) are exactly what's needed for monitoring stratum traffic and validating job broadcasts.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Evidence Collection is STRONG**: The 10 evidence items are concrete and verifiable:\n   - Raw stratum JSON (observable network capture)\n   - Parsed parameters (specific extractable values)\n   - Field-by-field validation results (binary pass/fail with values)\n   - Difficulty calculations (mathematically verifiable)\n   - Merkle branch analysis (structural validation)\n   - Timestamp checks (temporal verification)\n   - Job update timeline (chronological sequence)\n   - Network/log captures (raw data preservation)\n   - Error documentation (failure forensics)\n\n2. **Technical Accuracy**: The plan correctly identifies the stratum `mining.notify` method and all required fields (job_id, prevhash, coinb1, coinb2, merkle_branch, version, nbits, ntime, clean_jobs). This matches the stratum v1 protocol specification.\n\n3. **Decision Keywords Match Requirements**: The five decisions (job_received, job_valid, job_invalid, no_jobs, error) directly satisfy the stated requirements and map to logical outcomes of job monitoring.\n\n4. **Confidence Justification**: The \"High\" confidence is well-reasoned with 8 specific supporting points including protocol documentation, existing references, standard tooling, and clear requirements.\n\n**Potential Concerns (Minor):**\n\n1. The plan doesn't explicitly mention handling encrypted stratum connections (SSL/TLS), though this is likely acceptable for regtest monitoring.\n\n2. No mention of handling different stratum variants (Stratum V2), but given this is for Bitcoin Core regtest with existing pools, Stratum V1 is appropriate.\n\n3. Configuration values (port 3333, monitoring duration) aren't specified in detail, but the plan indicates these will be in the \"configuration section\" of the JSON.\n\nThese are very minor concerns that don't undermine the plan's viability.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe proposed evidence is concrete, verifiable, and comprehensive. Each of the 10 evidence items:\n- Can be objectively collected (network captures, log files, parsed data)\n- Provides specific values (not vague assessments)\n- Enables verification of success criteria (all required fields present and valid)\n- Supports debugging when issues occur (timestamps, sequences, error details)\n- Covers both positive cases (valid jobs) and negative cases (validation failures)\n\nThe evidence directly proves whether the agent successfully monitors stratum jobs, parses all parameters, validates each field, and detects updates.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\n\n**Reasoning**: This plan meets all criteria for approval:\n1. ✅ Crystal clear understanding of stratum job validation requirements\n2. ✅ Logical 11-step approach from research to implementation\n3. ✅ Concrete, verifiable evidence (10 specific items) proving task completion\n4. ✅ High confidence with solid technical justification\n5. ✅ Comprehensive test scenarios covering real-world cases\n6. ✅ Appropriate tools for network monitoring and log parsing\n7. ✅ Decision keywords exactly match requirements\n\nThe plan will produce a functional job_validator agent that can monitor stratum traffic, validate all job parameters, and provide concrete evidence of successful validation.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
