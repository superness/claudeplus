    "design_specification": "Now I have enough context to create a comprehensive plan for building the bitcoin_daemon_manager agent.\n\n---\n\n**UNDERSTANDING:** User wants me to create a detailed plan for building a bitcoin_daemon_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent must manage Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode with capabilities including: installation verification, configuration generation, daemon start/stop, status queries (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo), block generation (generatetoaddress), and wallet creation/funding. The agent JSON file should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json with specified permissions and decision outputs.\n\n**APPROACH:** I will analyze the existing bitcoin_daemon_manager.json structure from the SuperCoinServ project, examine the requirements from section 2.1 of the plan, and design a comprehensive agent specification that follows the established agent pattern (similar to pool_server_manager and miner_manager in claudeplus directory). The plan will detail the agent's structure including: core configuration, capabilities/responsibilities, RPC endpoints, command handlers, error handling, validation rules, and integration points. I'll ensure the agent design aligns with the regtest testing workflow and supports all required Bitcoin daemon operations.\n\n**STEPS:**\n\n1) **Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1** - Use Read tool to examine lines 115-138 to extract complete requirements and success criteria for bitcoin_daemon_manager\n   \n2) **Analyze existing agent structures** - Compare the two existing agent formats:\n   - SuperCoinServ format: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json (detailed with RPC endpoints, error handling, metrics)\n   - ClaudePlus format: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json (simpler systemPrompt-based format)\n\n3) **Determine target agent format** - Based on claudeplus directory structure and existing agents (pool_server_manager.json, miner_manager.json), use the simpler systemPrompt format for consistency\n\n4) **Design agent structure** with these sections:\n   - id, name, role fields\n   - expertise array covering all capabilities from requirements\n   - Comprehensive systemPrompt covering:\n     - Installation/verification of bitcoind\n     - Regtest configuration generation (bitcoin.conf parameters)\n     - Daemon lifecycle commands (start/stop/restart)\n     - RPC operations (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo, getblockcount)\n     - Block generation (generatetoaddress with mature coinbase requirements)\n     - Wallet operations (createwallet, loadwallet, funding)\n     - Error handling scenarios\n     - WSL/Linux path considerations\n     - Success criteria and validation\n   - outputFormat: \"markdown\"\n   - validationCriteria array matching success criteria from section 2.1\n\n5) **Document required Bitcoin daemon operations** in systemPrompt:\n   - bitcoind installation paths and verification\n   - Regtest-specific configuration parameters (rpcuser, rpcpassword, rpcport=18443, port=18444, regtest=1, server=1, daemon=1, fallbackfee)\n   - Startup verification (wait for RPC, check getblockchaininfo)\n   - Block generation for coinbase maturity (101 blocks minimum)\n   - Wallet creation and initial funding workflow\n   - Graceful shutdown procedures\n\n6) **Define decision outputs** - Map agent outcomes to required decisions:\n   - daemon_started: Successful daemon launch and RPC ready\n   - daemon_stopped: Clean shutdown completed\n   - daemon_error: Startup failure, RPC timeout, crash, etc.\n   - error: General error condition\n\n7) **Create validation criteria** based on section 2.1 success criteria:\n   - Can start daemon from cold state\n   - Can generate 101 blocks (mature coinbase)\n   - RPC interface responds correctly\n   - Clean shutdown with no corruption\n\n8) **Write comprehensive systemPrompt** covering:\n   - Command syntax for bitcoind and bitcoin-cli\n   - Configuration file generation and locations\n   - RPC authentication and connectivity testing\n   - Error scenarios (port conflicts, data corruption, RPC timeouts)\n   - Regtest workflow best practices\n   - Integration with pool_server_manager (RPC connection info)\n\n9) **Structure JSON file** with proper formatting:\n   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n   - Include all required fields\n   - Ensure JSON validity\n   - Add helpful comments in systemPrompt\n\n10) **Write final JSON to target path** - Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:** The plan addresses test scenarios through:\n\n1. **Cold Start Testing**: Agent design includes verification of bitcoind installation, data directory initialization, and first-time configuration generation\n2. **RPC Connectivity**: SystemPrompt will detail RPC connection testing procedures (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo) with timeout handling\n3. **Block Generation**: Explicit coverage of generatetoaddress command with 101-block requirement for coinbase maturity\n4. **Wallet Lifecycle**: Create/load wallet operations with funding workflows for regtest testing\n5. **Error Scenarios**: Coverage of port conflicts, RPC failures, daemon crashes, and recovery procedures\n6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Procedures for clean daemon termination without data corruption\n7. **Integration Testing**: RPC configuration output for pool_server_manager consumption\n8. **Edge Cases**: Empty blockchain state, existing data directory, running daemon detection, network type validation\n\n**EVIDENCE:** Upon completion, the plan will specify collection of:\n\n1. Complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json file content showing all sections\n2. List of capabilities mapped to requirements from section 2.1\n3. Decision output mappings (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)\n4. ValidationCriteria matching success criteria from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n5. SystemPrompt sections addressing each required capability:\n   - Installation verification commands\n   - Configuration generation templates\n   - Startup procedures\n   - RPC query examples\n   - Block generation workflows\n   - Wallet creation/funding steps\n   - Error handling strategies\n6. JSON structure validation (proper syntax, required fields, format consistency)\n7. Alignment with existing claudeplus agent patterns (pool_server_manager, miner_manager formats)\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** High\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Clear requirements in section 2.1 with explicit capabilities and success criteria\n- Existing agent examples in both SuperCoinServ and claudeplus formats provide structural templates\n- Bitcoin daemon RPC interface is well-documented and standardized\n- Regtest mode operations are straightforward and deterministic\n- Agent pattern is established and consistent across existing agents\n- File path and permissions are explicitly specified\n- Decision outputs are clearly defined\n- All required capabilities map directly to standard bitcoin-cli/bitcoind operations\n\n**Potential Challenges (mitigated):**\n- Format choice between detailed (SuperCoinServ) vs simple (claudeplus) → Use claudeplus format for consistency with target directory\n- WSL/Linux path handling → Document in systemPrompt with examples\n- RPC timeout scenarios → Include retry logic and error handling guidance\n- Daemon state detection → Provide commands for process checking and port verification\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT: This is an exceptionally thorough and well-structured plan for building the bitcoin_daemon_manager agent. Let me evaluate it against strict criteria:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Crystal Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive understanding of requirements, explicitly mapping section 2.1 requirements to agent capabilities (installation, configuration, lifecycle management, RPC operations, block generation, wallet management)\n\n2. **Logical Step-by-Step Approach**: \n   - Step 1-2: Research phase (read requirements, analyze existing patterns)\n   - Step 3: Critical decision on format consistency\n   - Step 4-8: Systematic design of all agent components\n   - Step 9-10: Implementation and validation\n   \n   The flow is logical and each step builds on previous ones.\n\n3. **Concrete Evidence Collection**: The EVIDENCE section specifies exactly what will prove completion:\n   - Complete JSON file content\n   - Capability-to-requirement mappings\n   - Decision output mappings to all 4 required decisions\n   - ValidationCriteria alignment with section 2.1\n   - SystemPrompt coverage of each capability with specific examples\n   - JSON syntax validation\n   - Format consistency verification\n\n4. **High Confidence with Strong Justification**: \n   - Explicit requirements in section 2.1\n   - Multiple existing agent examples as templates\n   - Well-documented Bitcoin RPC interface\n   - Deterministic regtest operations\n   - Clear file path and permissions\n   - Identified and mitigated potential challenges\n\n5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The plan addresses all requirements:\n   - ✓ Install/verify bitcoind\n   - ✓ Generate regtest configuration\n   - ✓ Start/stop daemon\n   - ✓ Query status (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)\n   - ✓ Generate blocks (generatetoaddress)\n   - ✓ Create/fund wallets\n   - ✓ All 4 decision outputs\n   - ✓ Target file path specified\n\n6. **Test Considerations**: Extremely thorough with 8 distinct test scenarios covering cold start, RPC connectivity, block generation, wallet lifecycle, errors, shutdown, integration, and edge cases.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n1. The plan references reading section 2.1 \"lines 115-138\" but doesn't show the actual content - however, this is acceptable as Step 1 will verify this\n2. Format decision between SuperCoinServ vs claudeplus - but this is explicitly addressed and resolved in Step 3\n3. No mention of actually testing the generated JSON - but the validation criteria and evidence collection should suffice for design approval\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong**\n\nThe evidence specification is concrete and verifiable:\n- File content can be read and inspected\n- Mappings can be traced and verified\n- JSON validation is objective\n- SystemPrompt sections can be checked against requirements checklist\n- Format consistency can be compared with existing agents\n\nEach evidence item provides objective, measurable proof that the agent meets its requirements.\n\n**Verification Checklist:**\n- [x] Shows clear understanding of user request\n- [x] Has logical, sequential approach\n- [x] Specifies concrete, verifiable evidence\n- [x] High confidence with solid reasoning\n- [x] Not vague or unclear\n- [x] Includes specific evidence collection steps\n- [x] Confidence justified by reasoning\n- [x] Can provide concrete proof of completion\n\nThe plan meets all strict criteria for approval. It's comprehensive, well-reasoned, and will produce verifiable evidence of successful completion. The systematic approach ensures nothing is missed, and the evidence collection will prove the agent satisfies all requirements from section 2.1.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)",
