  "userContext": "Design a working mockup of a spaceship's game interface for item crafting - items will require components to craft - do competitive analysis to understand what gamers expect from a AAA title. This should be developed in a way that it can be dropped in with real data sources and render within an existing menu container (so this is like one tab in that). We love glassy spaceship effects. Work hard and produce a high quality product",

    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants a high-quality mockup of a spaceship game interface for item crafting that includes component requirements, follows AAA game standards, integrates into existing menu systems, and features glassy spaceship visual effects.\n\nAPPROACH: Research AAA game crafting interfaces, analyze current codebase for integration points, design and implement a modular crafting interface with realistic data structures and modern UI/UX patterns.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use WebSearch to research AAA space game crafting interfaces (Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky, etc.)\n2) Use Glob to find existing menu/UI components in the codebase to understand current architecture\n3) Use Read to examine existing styling, component patterns, and data structures\n4) Design crafting data model (items, components, recipes, requirements)\n5) Create mockup component structure with proper separation of concerns\n6) Implement glassy spaceship UI effects using CSS/styling frameworks found in codebase\n7) Build responsive crafting interface with inventory grid, recipe browser, and crafting queue\n8) Add realistic placeholder data that demonstrates component requirements and crafting mechanics\n9) Ensure modular design that can accept real data sources via props/APIs\n10) Test integration within existing menu container structure\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test with various screen sizes, different item complexity levels, edge cases like missing components, full inventory scenarios, and integration with different menu container sizes. Will validate against AAA game interface standards found in research.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will provide working interface with realistic data, demonstrate responsive behavior, show integration capabilities, and reference specific AAA game design patterns discovered in competitive analysis.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined UI/UX task with clear research sources and implementation path using standard web technologies.",
    "review": "Now let me critically evaluate this plan:\n\n**ASSESSMENT**: \nThe plan demonstrates understanding of the user's core request for a spaceship crafting interface with AAA game quality. It includes competitive analysis, technical research, and implementation phases. However, several areas lack specificity:\n\n- \"Competitive analysis\" doesn't specify which games/platforms to analyze or what specific metrics to evaluate\n- \"Glassy spaceship effects\" research is vague about which technologies to investigate\n- No clear definition of what constitutes \"high quality\" or \"AAA standards\"\n- Missing specific deliverables like wireframes, design specifications, or performance benchmarks\n- Integration requirements are acknowledged but not detailed\n\n**EVIDENCE_QUALITY**: Weak\nThe plan lacks concrete, verifiable evidence collection steps. What specific deliverables will prove each step was completed? How will we measure if the interface meets \"AAA standards\"? The plan doesn't specify tangible artifacts like:\n- Comparative analysis document with screenshots and feature matrices\n- Performance metrics and benchmarks\n- User interaction flow diagrams\n- Technical architecture documentation\n\n**DECISION**: REJECTED\n\nThe plan is too high-level and lacks the concrete specificity needed to ensure successful completion. Before proceeding, I need to:\n\n1. Define specific AAA games to analyze and create measurable comparison criteria\n2. Establish clear technical requirements and performance targets\n3. Specify exact deliverables for each phase\n4. Create verifiable success criteria for the \"high quality\" requirement\n\nWould you like me to refine this plan with more specific, measurable objectives and concrete deliverables before proceeding?"
