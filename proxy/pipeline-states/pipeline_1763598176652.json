    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the wallet_manager agent according to section 2.2 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document. The agent should handle wallet operations including creation, address generation, balance queries, transaction monitoring, and backups. I need to write the complete agent JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json. I've found that a wallet_manager.json already exists in the private-SuperCoinServ project, which I can use as a reference for structure and requirements.\n\nAPPROACH: I will create a comprehensive plan to develop the wallet_manager agent based on:\n1. Section 2.2 specifications from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (lines 235-255)\n2. The existing wallet_manager.json structure from private-SuperCoinServ (which provides detailed implementation guidance)\n3. The pattern established by bitcoin_daemon_manager.json in claudeplus\n4. User requirements for wallet operations using bitcoin-cli\n\nThe agent will handle wallet lifecycle, address management, balance tracking, transaction monitoring, and backup operations.\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Read the existing wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ to understand the comprehensive structure and all required fields\n2. Analyze the bitcoin_daemon_manager.json structure from claudeplus to understand the agent format (systemPrompt style, configuration, decisions)\n3. Extract section 2.2 requirements from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (wallet_manager capabilities)\n4. Create a comprehensive systemPrompt that covers:\n   - Wallet creation using bitcoin-cli createwallet\n   - Address generation (getnewaddress)\n   - Wallet funding via generatetoaddress (regtest)\n   - Balance queries (getbalance, getwalletinfo, listunspent)\n   - Transaction monitoring (listtransactions, gettransaction)\n   - Wallet backup (backupwallet)\n   - Error handling and recovery\n   - Integration with bitcoin daemon\n5. Define the agent configuration including RPC settings, wallet settings, address pool management, backup configuration\n6. Define all decision keywords: wallet_created, wallet_loaded, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, address_generated, error\n7. Structure the complete JSON with all required fields: id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria, requiredTools, decisions, configuration\n8. Write the complete agent JSON file to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json\n9. Validate JSON syntax and completeness\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Test wallet creation from scratch (no existing wallet)\n- Test wallet loading when wallet already exists\n- Test address generation (multiple addresses, different types)\n- Test wallet funding with 101 blocks (mature coinbase)\n- Test balance queries with various states (empty, funded, confirmed, unconfirmed)\n- Test transaction monitoring (incoming, outgoing, confirmations)\n- Test backup operations (successful backup, failed backup with recovery)\n- Test error scenarios:\n  - Daemon not running\n  - Wallet already exists (handle gracefully)\n  - RPC connection failures\n  - Insufficient funds\n  - Invalid addresses\n  - Backup directory doesn't exist\n\nEVIDENCE: I will collect the following proof:\n1. Read output showing the existing wallet_manager.json structure from private-SuperCoinServ\n2. Read output showing bitcoin_daemon_manager.json pattern from claudeplus\n3. The complete wallet_manager.json file content written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json\n4. File verification showing the JSON was created successfully\n5. JSON structure validation (proper format, all required fields present)\n6. Decision keywords properly defined matching user requirements\n7. SystemPrompt covering all capabilities listed in section 2.2\n8. Configuration matching regtest environment requirements\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - I have:\n- Clear specification from section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Existing comprehensive wallet_manager.json as reference\n- Established agent pattern from bitcoin_daemon_manager.json\n- Specific user requirements for capabilities and decisions\n- Well-defined bitcoin-cli commands for wallet operations\n- Clear output path specified by user\n- All necessary permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)\n\nDECISION: design_complete",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Understanding of Request**: The plan demonstrates a clear understanding of the task - building a wallet_manager agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md with specific capabilities for wallet creation, address generation, funding, balance queries, transaction monitoring, and backup operations.\n\n**Approach Quality**: The approach is methodical and well-structured:\n- Leverages existing reference implementations (wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ, bitcoin_daemon_manager.json from claudeplus)\n- Follows established patterns for agent JSON structure\n- Covers all user-specified requirements comprehensively\n- Includes proper error handling considerations\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic**: The 9-step plan is logical and sequential:\n1. Research existing implementations ✓\n2. Understand agent format ✓\n3. Extract requirements ✓\n4. Create comprehensive systemPrompt ✓\n5. Define configuration ✓\n6. Define decision keywords ✓\n7. Structure complete JSON ✓\n8. Write to specified path ✓\n9. Validate output ✓\n\n**Test Considerations**: Excellent coverage of test scenarios:\n- Wallet lifecycle operations (create, load, fund)\n- Address generation variations\n- Balance query states\n- Transaction monitoring\n- Backup operations\n- Comprehensive error scenarios (daemon down, duplicate wallets, RPC failures, etc.)\n\n**Evidence Quality Analysis**:\n\n**STRENGTHS**:\n1. Concrete file outputs specified: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`\n2. Multiple reference reads (existing wallet_manager.json, bitcoin_daemon_manager.json)\n3. File verification and JSON validation steps\n4. Specific checks for required fields and decision keywords\n5. SystemPrompt coverage verification for section 2.2 requirements\n\n**WEAKNESSES**:\n1. Missing actual read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2 - the plan references it but doesn't explicitly show reading it\n2. No verification that the output JSON matches the exact format expected by the claudeplus system\n3. No example of comparing the generated JSON against the specification requirements systematically\n\n**CONCERNS**:\n- The plan assumes the existing wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ is the correct reference, but doesn't verify it aligns with section 2.2 specs\n- No explicit step to verify all user-specified decisions (wallet_created, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, error) are included\n\n**Confidence Justification**: The \"High\" confidence is well-justified because:\n- Clear specifications exist\n- Reference implementations available\n- Required permissions granted\n- Well-defined bitcoin-cli commands\n- Specific output path provided\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe proposed evidence includes:\n- Concrete file reads from reference implementations\n- The complete JSON file written to specified path\n- File verification and JSON validation\n- Structural checks for required fields\n- Coverage verification for capabilities and decisions\n\nHowever, it could be strengthened by explicitly including the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2 read as evidence item #1.\n\n**Minor Refinement Needed**: The plan should explicitly include reading section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md as the first evidence item to verify alignment with the source specification.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
