    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a new mobile-specific version of the desktop-mode.html file that maintains all existing features while being optimized for mobile layouts and performance.\n\nAPPROACH: I will analyze the existing desktop-mode.html file to understand its structure, features, and styling, then create a mobile-optimized version that preserves functionality while adapting the UI for mobile screens.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Use Read tool to examine the current desktop-mode.html file structure and features\n2) Use Read tool to analyze any associated CSS/JS files (desktop-renderer.js) to understand functionality\n3) Use Grep tool to search for mobile-specific CSS or responsive design patterns already in the codebase\n4) Create a new mobile-mode.html file with mobile-optimized layout and viewport settings\n5) Adapt the CSS for mobile-first design with touch-friendly interfaces\n6) Ensure all existing features (chat, file uploads, settings, etc.) work on mobile\n7) Test responsive breakpoints and mobile-specific interactions\n8) Verify performance optimizations for mobile devices\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will test on various mobile screen sizes (320px-768px), portrait/landscape orientations, touch interactions, keyboard overlays, and ensure features like file uploads, chat scrolling, and settings menus work properly on mobile devices.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will demonstrate the mobile version renders correctly on small screens, maintains all original functionality, shows improved mobile performance metrics, and provides screenshots/comparisons showing mobile-optimized layouts.\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward frontend development task involving responsive design adaptation of an existing HTML interface, which is well within standard web development practices.",
    "review": "ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a clear understanding of the user's request to create a mobile-optimized version of desktop-mode.html. The approach is logical and methodical, starting with analysis of existing code and progressing through creation and testing phases. The plan correctly identifies the need to examine the current structure, understand functionality, and adapt for mobile constraints while preserving features.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses in the plan:\n- Step 3 about searching for existing mobile CSS patterns may not yield useful results since this appears to be creating a new mobile version\n- The plan doesn't specify how it will handle potential conflicts between desktop and mobile versions\n- Missing consideration of how the mobile version will integrate with the existing server endpoints and authentication system\n- No mention of testing the mobile version with the actual backend functionality\n\nThe plan does show good understanding of mobile development considerations like viewport settings, touch interfaces, responsive breakpoints, and performance optimization.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak - While the plan mentions \"screenshots/comparisons showing mobile-optimized layouts\" and \"improved mobile performance metrics,\" it lacks specific, verifiable evidence criteria. The plan should specify:\n- Exact mobile screen sizes to test (specific device dimensions)\n- Quantifiable performance metrics to measure\n- Specific functional tests to verify each feature works\n- Clear before/after comparisons with measurable criteria\n\nThe evidence is too general and doesn't provide concrete ways to verify that \"all existing features\" actually work on mobile or that it truly \"runs fast and looks the same.\"\n\nDECISION: REJECTED - The plan lacks sufficient detail on verifiable evidence collection and concrete success criteria. While the approach is sound, the evidence quality is insufficient to prove task completion with confidence. The plan needs more specific, measurable criteria for testing and validation."
