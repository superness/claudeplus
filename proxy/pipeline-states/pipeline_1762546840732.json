    "planning": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants to fix mobile responsive layout issues in desktop-mode.html where content sometimes overflows beyond the viewport depending on chat content and phone resolution, while preserving existing styling.\n\nAPPROACH: Analyze the current HTML/CSS structure, identify overflow causes, and implement mobile-first responsive design fixes using CSS viewport units, flexbox/grid optimizations, and proper scrolling containers.\n\nSTEPS: \n1) Read /mnt/c/github/ai-assistant/www/src/desktop-mode.html to understand current structure\n2) Use Grep to find CSS files and examine styling patterns with pattern \"\\.css$\"\n3) Analyze viewport meta tags, container heights, and flex/grid layouts\n4) Identify overflow triggers (chat messages, input areas, image content)\n5) Test current layout behavior by examining CSS for fixed heights, absolute positioning\n6) Create responsive fixes using CSS clamp(), vh/vw units, overflow handling\n7) Implement proper scrolling containers for chat areas\n8) Add media queries for various mobile breakpoints if needed\n9) Preserve existing design aesthetic while fixing overflow issues\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will address scenarios like long chat histories, large images in messages, different phone screen sizes (small phones ~320px to large phones ~428px), landscape/portrait orientations, virtual keyboard appearance, and content that exceeds viewport height.\n\nEVIDENCE: Will show before/after CSS comparisons, demonstrate how overflow containers are structured, provide specific CSS rules that handle viewport constraints, and show how existing styling is preserved while fixing mobile issues.\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - Responsive layout fixes require careful analysis of existing CSS architecture and testing across multiple viewport scenarios without breaking current design patterns."
