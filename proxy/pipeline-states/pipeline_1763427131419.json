Verify the items are fitted and the save file contains them\n6. Print a message like 'Items fitted and saved. Now close Chrome completely, reopen the game client, and verify items are still fitted.'\n\nThe test does NOT need to automate the close/reopen - that's a manual verification step. The bug reproduction just needs to set up the scenario and save it.\n\nThen implement a fix to ensure fitted items are properly restored when the game loads from a save file.",
