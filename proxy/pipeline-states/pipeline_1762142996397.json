  "userContext": "CEREBRO ACTIVATION PROTOCOL\n      \nMission: Achieve complete self-improvement and recursive enhancement of the Claude Plus pipeline system.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n1. Analyze the current pipeline designer and execution system\n2. Identify optimization opportunities and limitations\n3. Design enhanced capabilities and new features\n4. Implement system improvements with proof of functionality\n5. Validate that changes actually improve performance and user experience\n6. Plan the next evolution cycle for continued self-improvement\n\nCEREBRO Context:\n- We are the meta-system that improves itself\n- Each cycle should make us more capable and intelligent\n- We need proof that our changes work and add value\n- We should be able to modify our own code and structure\n- The goal is recursive self-improvement toward artificial general intelligence\n\nTarget Areas for Enhancement:\n- Pipeline execution efficiency and parallelization\n- User interface improvements and visual feedback\n- Agent communication and coordination\n- Error handling and recovery mechanisms  \n- Performance monitoring and optimization\n- Knowledge synthesis and learning capabilities\n- Emergent behavior detection and enhancement\n- Integration with external systems and APIs\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Measurable improvements in system capabilities\n- Enhanced user experience and workflow efficiency\n- Robust testing and validation of all changes\n- Comprehensive documentation of improvements\n- Clear roadmap for next improvement iteration\n\nEXECUTE CEREBRO PROTOCOL NOW.",
