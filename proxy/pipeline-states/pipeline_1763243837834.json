    "planning": "Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing/crafting UI. Let me analyze the screenshot and code to create a thorough plan.\n\n## UNDERSTANDING\n\nYou want me to analyze the Nano-Forge manufacturing/crafting UI shown in Capture.PNG for UX/accessibility issues (text overflow, readability problems, wasted space, etc.) and then design an improved version that maintains the existing quantum/sci-fi theme while resolving all identified problems.\n\n## APPROACH\n\nI will analyze both the visual screenshot and the corresponding code implementation to identify all UX/accessibility issues, document them comprehensively using AAA game development standards, and then create an improved design with updated CSS and HTML structure that resolves these issues while maintaining the established aesthetic.\n\n## STEPS\n\n1. **Visual Analysis of Capture.PNG**: Examine the screenshot to identify specific UI/UX issues:\n   - Text overflow and truncation problems\n   - Readability issues (font sizes, contrast, spacing)\n   - Wasted/empty space that could be better utilized\n   - Information hierarchy problems\n   - Accessibility concerns (color contrast, font sizing)\n   - Layout inefficiencies\n\n2. **Code Analysis**: Review the CraftingServiceUI class (lines 812-1500+) and nano-forge.css to understand:\n   - Current layout structure and constraints\n   - CSS styling decisions causing issues\n   - DOM structure and responsive behavior\n   - Fixed dimensions vs flexible layouts\n\n3. **Document AAA Game UX Issues**: Create a comprehensive list categorized by:\n   - Critical Issues (blocking usability)\n   - Major Issues (significant UX degradation)\n   - Minor Issues (polish/optimization opportunities)\n   - Accessibility Issues (WCAG compliance, readability)\n\n4. **Design New Layout**: Create improved design that:\n   - Resolves all identified issues\n   - Maintains quantum/sci-fi aesthetic (green/cyan glows, tech styling)\n   - Uses responsive layouts instead of fixed dimensions\n   - Improves information hierarchy and scannability\n   - Enhances readability with proper spacing and font sizes\n   - Better utilizes available space\n\n5. **Implementation Plan**: \n   - Update nano-forge.css with improved styles\n   - Modify CraftingServiceUI render method if needed for better HTML structure\n   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality\n   - Add responsive breakpoints if needed\n\n6. **Create Updated Files**: \n   - Write updated nano-forge.css\n   - Update StationUI.js CraftingServiceUI if structural changes needed\n   - Document all changes made\n\n## TEST_CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Text Overflow Scenarios**: Test with long blueprint names, long material names, various quantity values\n- **Different Screen Sizes**: Verify layout works at different viewport widths (1920px, 1440px, 1280px)\n- **Content Density**: Test with maximum blueprints (full grid), maximum materials (long lists), maximum active jobs\n- **Readability**: Verify text contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)\n- **Interactive States**: Test hover states, selected states, disabled states are clearly visible\n- **Information Scannability**: Ensure users can quickly find critical information (material availability, blueprint status, progress)\n- **Edge Cases**: Empty states, single item, overflow scrolling behavior\n\n## EVIDENCE\n\nI will provide:\n- Annotated screenshot analysis showing specific problem areas\n- Detailed issue list with severity ratings and specific line references\n- Before/after comparison of key problem areas\n- Updated CSS file with comments explaining each change\n- Updated HTML structure (if needed) with explanatory comments\n- Specific measurements showing improved contrast ratios, spacing, and font sizes\n- Visual mockup description of the improved design\n\n## CONFIDENCE\n\n**High** - This is a comprehensive UI/UX redesign task with clear scope:\n- Screenshot provides concrete visual evidence of issues\n- Full access to implementation code (CSS and JavaScript)\n- Well-defined design system already established (quantum/sci-fi theme)\n- Clear success criteria (fix overflow, improve readability, better space utilization)\n- Extensive CSS file to work with (836 lines of existing styles)\n\nThe main work involves careful analysis, documenting issues systematically, and methodically improving the CSS while maintaining the established aesthetic. This is well within scope for a planning task.\n\nDECISION: plan_complete",
    "review": "## ASSESSMENT\n\nThis plan demonstrates **excellent understanding** of the user's request and provides a **highly structured, methodical approach** to UI/UX analysis and redesign. The planner has:\n\n1. **Clear Understanding**: Correctly identified the task as analyzing Capture.PNG for manufacturing/crafting UI issues, documenting them to AAA standards, and creating an improved design\n2. **Systematic Approach**: Well-organized steps from visual analysis → code analysis → issue documentation → design → implementation\n3. **Specific Investigation Points**: Identifies concrete areas to examine (text overflow, spacing, contrast, layout structure)\n4. **Appropriate Scope**: Focuses on CSS improvements and potential HTML structure updates while maintaining existing functionality\n5. **Strong Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test considerations including edge cases, accessibility standards, and responsive behavior\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Detailed breakdown of analysis categories (Critical/Major/Minor/Accessibility issues)\n- Specific reference to code locations (CraftingServiceUI lines 812-1500+, nano-forge.css)\n- Emphasis on maintaining existing theme while fixing problems\n- WCAG accessibility standards mentioned (4.5:1 contrast ratios)\n- Multiple test scenarios identified\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The \"annotated screenshot analysis\" in evidence may be challenging to deliver in text format\n- \"Visual mockup description\" is somewhat vague - actual CSS implementation would be more concrete\n\n## EVIDENCE_QUALITY\n\n**Strong** - The proposed evidence includes:\n- ✅ Detailed issue list with severity ratings and line references (verifiable)\n- ✅ Updated CSS file with explanatory comments (concrete deliverable)\n- ✅ Updated HTML structure with comments (concrete deliverable)\n- ✅ Specific measurements (contrast ratios, spacing, font sizes - quantifiable)\n- ⚠️ Annotated screenshot analysis (may be text-based description rather than actual annotation)\n- ⚠️ Before/after comparison (descriptive rather than visual)\n- ⚠️ Visual mockup description (descriptive rather than actual mockup)\n\nThe core deliverables (issue documentation, updated code files, specific measurements) provide **concrete, verifiable proof** of task completion. The visual elements may be text descriptions rather than images, which is acceptable given the text-based interface.\n\n## DECISION\n\n**APPROVED** - This plan demonstrates:\n- Crystal clear understanding of the UI redesign task\n- Logical, step-by-step methodology from analysis to implementation\n- Concrete deliverables (issue list, updated CSS/HTML, measurements)\n- High confidence with solid justification (access to code, screenshot, clear scope)\n- Comprehensive testing strategy and success criteria\n\nThe planner will provide verifiable evidence through documented issues, code changes, and specific measurements. The systematic approach ensures thorough coverage of UX/accessibility problems.\n\n**DECISION: APPROVED (Plan approved, proceed to execution)**",
