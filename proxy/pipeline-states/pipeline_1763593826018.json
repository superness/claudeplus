    "design_specification": "UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a task plan for building a pool_server_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to manage CoiniumServ pool server operations from WSL to Windows, including launching, monitoring, configuration generation, log parsing, and shutdown capabilities. The final output should be a complete agent JSON file written to a specific path.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.1 specifications\n2. Locate the CoiniumServ executable in the current repository structure\n3. Examine existing pool configuration files to understand the config.json structure\n4. Analyze the agent JSON schema/format by looking for existing agent examples in the repository\n5. Design the agent with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision points (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error)\n6. Create comprehensive agent instructions covering all required functionalities\n7. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Use Read tool to read /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract section 2.1 requirements\n2. Use Glob tool with pattern \"**/CoiniumServ.exe\" or \"**/CoiniumServ\" to locate the executable\n3. Use Glob tool with pattern \"**/config*.json\" in build/bin directories to find existing configuration examples\n4. Use Read tool to examine existing config files (build/bin/Debug/config/config.json and build/bin/Debug/config/config-example.json)\n5. Use Glob tool to search for existing agent JSON files (pattern \"**/*agent*.json\" or similar) to understand the agent schema\n6. If no agent examples exist, search for agent documentation or schema files\n7. Design the agent JSON structure with:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Tool permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep\n   - Decision endpoints: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error\n   - Detailed instructions covering:\n     * Locating CoiniumServ.exe in Windows path format\n     * Generating/validating pool config.json\n     * WSL to Windows execution commands (e.g., cmd.exe /c or powershell.exe)\n     * Process health monitoring strategies\n     * Log file parsing and monitoring\n     * Graceful shutdown procedures\n8. Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json with the complete agent definition\n9. Use Read tool to verify the written file is valid JSON and complete\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Test with CoiniumServ executable located in different directories (Debug/Release builds)\n- Handle missing executable scenarios (error decision)\n- Validate config.json generation with required pool parameters\n- Test WSL→Windows execution with different command formats (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, .exe direct)\n- Monitor process health with missing/inaccessible log files\n- Test log parsing with various log formats and error messages\n- Handle shutdown scenarios: graceful termination, force kill, already stopped\n- Verify error handling for permission issues crossing WSL/Windows boundary\n- Test with pool server already running (detect and handle)\n- Validate configuration file write permissions in Windows directories from WSL\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Show the content of section 2.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Display the located CoiniumServ executable path\n- Show example config.json structure from existing files\n- Provide the complete agent JSON structure with all required fields\n- Display the final written agent file content\n- Show validation that the JSON is properly formatted\n- Include specific bash commands for WSL→Windows execution (e.g., \"/mnt/c/path/to/CoiniumServ.exe\" or \"cmd.exe /c 'C:\\path\\to\\CoiniumServ.exe'\")\n- Document the log file paths and parsing patterns\n- Show process monitoring commands (e.g., ps, tasklist.exe via WSL)\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High\n- High confidence in reading documentation and creating JSON structure\n- Medium-high confidence in WSL→Windows execution patterns (may need to verify exact command syntax)\n- High confidence in file manipulation and configuration generation\n- Medium confidence in agent schema (depends on finding existing examples or documentation)\n- The main uncertainty is the exact agent JSON schema format used by the claudeplus system, but can infer from common patterns\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",
    "design_review": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates solid comprehension of the task - creating a pool_server_manager agent JSON file based on section 2.1 specifications with specific capabilities (launch, monitor, configure, shutdown CoiniumServ)\n2. **Logical Structure**: The 9-step approach is well-sequenced:\n   - First reads requirements from documentation\n   - Locates necessary executables and configs\n   - Studies existing patterns/schemas\n   - Designs the agent\n   - Writes and validates output\n3. **Appropriate Tools**: Correctly identifies the need for Read, Glob, Grep tools to gather information before writing\n4. **WSL→Windows Awareness**: Shows understanding of cross-environment challenges (execution paths, permissions, process monitoring)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Critical Schema Uncertainty**: Step 5-6 acknowledges \"may not find existing agent examples\" - this is a major risk. The plan doesn't have a fallback if no agent schema exists. The confidence statement says \"medium confidence in agent schema\" but proceeds anyway.\n2. **Vague Agent Structure**: The plan says \"design the agent JSON structure\" but doesn't specify what fields are expected. Without seeing an example agent schema, the output format is uncertain.\n3. **Missing Verification Steps**: No plan to validate the agent JSON against a schema or test it in the claudeplus system\n4. **WSL Command Syntax Uncertainty**: Notes \"may need to verify exact command syntax\" but doesn't plan a verification step\n5. **No Reference to Agent Framework**: Doesn't mention checking for claudeplus documentation about agent structure\n\n**Evidence Quality Issues:**\n- Evidence list is comprehensive for information gathering BUT\n- Missing: \"Show that the agent JSON validates against the expected schema\"\n- Missing: \"Demonstrate the agent can be loaded by the claudeplus system\"\n- The plan can produce a JSON file but cannot prove it's in the correct format for claudeplus\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**\n\nThe plan will gather good information (section 2.1 requirements, executable paths, config examples) but the final deliverable's correctness cannot be verified without:\n1. An existing agent schema/example to follow\n2. Validation against claudeplus agent loader\n3. Confirmation of required JSON fields\n\nThe evidence proves \"a JSON file was created\" but not \"a valid claudeplus agent was created.\"\n\n**Critical Gap**: The plan assumes an agent JSON schema can be inferred or found, but provides no contingency if the claudeplus agents directory doesn't exist or has no examples. This could result in creating a JSON file in an arbitrary format that doesn't work.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasoning:**\n1. **Unverifiable Deliverable**: Cannot guarantee the agent JSON will be in the correct format for the claudeplus system without a schema reference\n2. **Missing Validation**: No step to verify the output works with the target system\n3. **Insufficient Fallback**: If no agent examples exist (likely given this appears to be early development), the plan has no alternative approach\n4. **Format Assumption Risk**: Creating an agent JSON based on \"common patterns\" without specification is likely to fail\n\n**Required Revisions:**\n1. Add step to search for claudeplus agent documentation/schema first\n2. If no schema exists, ask user for agent format specification or example\n3. Include validation step to test agent JSON can be parsed by claudeplus\n4. Add explicit fallback plan if agent schema cannot be determined\n5. Consider reading the claudeplus system code to understand expected agent format\n\nThe plan is well-structured for information gathering but fails the \"concrete, verifiable evidence\" requirement because it cannot prove the output agent JSON is valid for its intended use.",
