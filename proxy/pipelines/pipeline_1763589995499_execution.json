Address how your approach will handle the test cases and edge scenarios.\n\nDO NOT give final answers. CREATE A PLAN with specific commands/tools you will use.\n\nWhen your plan is complete, end your response with:\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with exactly one of these decisions:\n- DECISION: PLAN_APPROVED (Development plan analyzed and understood)\n\nFormat: End with \"DECISION: [YOUR_CHOICE]\" on the last line.",
