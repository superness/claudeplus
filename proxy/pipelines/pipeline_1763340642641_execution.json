ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() receives thrustVector and should update velocity/position\\n\\nThe bug is likely in one of these areas:\\n- The thrustVector.magnitude field may not be preserved when passed between functions (object spread issues)\\n- The velocity calculation in ShipPhysics may not be applying correctly\\n- The position update may not be executing\\n- There could be a state management issue where navigation commands are being cleared before they take effect\\n\\nThe extensive logging in Ship.js (lines 203-346) suggests this bug was recently investigated, with multiple BUGFIX comments about magnitude preservation, indicating this is a known issue that may not be fully resolved.\"\n}\n```\n\nDECISION: analysis_complete",

First read `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` to see what commands are registered\n2. Look for the `registerCommandHandlers()` method which contains all available commands\n3. ONLY use commands that are actually registered in that file\n\n**Example of reading available commands:**\n```bash\ngrep \"commandHandlers.set\" /mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js\n```\n\nThis will show lines like:\n```\nthis.commandHandlers.set('getShipState', ...);\nthis.commandHandlers.set('setThrottle', ...);\n```\n\nIf a command you need is NOT in that list, use DECISION: need_command_implementation\n\n## WebSocket Server Architecture\n\n**Your script MUST:**\n1. Start a WebSocket server on port 8765\n2. Handle connections from both the game (browser) and test client\n3. Route commands from test client to game\n4. Route responses from game back to test client\n5. Include a 'listCommands' call as the FIRST command to verify what's available\n\n## AVAILABLE GAME COMMANDS (COMPLETE LIST)\n\nThese are the ONLY commands currently implemented in GameTestingInterface.js.\n**DO NOT use commands that are not on this list!**\n\nIf the bug you need to test requires a command that doesn't exist, use DECISION: need_command_implementation\n\n### Ship State Queries\n\n**getShipState** - Get current ship state\n```javascript\n{command: 'getShipState', params: {includeModules: true, includeInventory: false}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {\n//   position: {x, y, z},\n//   velocity: {x, y, z},\n//   rotation: {x, y, z, w},\n//   throttle: 0-100,\n//   shipType: 'Atron',\n//   hull: 100,\n//   capacitor: 100,\n//   isDocked: false,\n//   isWarping: false,\n//   fittedModules: [...]\n// }}\n```\n\n**getSceneInfo** - Get scene information\n```javascript\n{command: 'getSceneInfo', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {stations: [], celestials: [], ships: []}}\n```\n\n### Ship Control Commands\n\n**setThrottle** - Set ship throttle (0-100)\n```javascript\n{command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 75}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {throttle: 75}}\n```\n\n**dock** - Dock at nearest station\n```javascript\n{command: 'dock', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {docked: true, station: \"station_001\"}}\n```\n\n**undock** - Undock from station\n```javascript\n{command: 'undock', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {docked: false}}\n```\n\n### Inventory & Fitting Commands\n\n**getInventory** - Get cargo/inventory\n```javascript\n{command: 'getInventory', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {items: [{id, name, quantity, type}]}}\n```\n\n**fitItem** - Fit module to ship\n```javascript\n{command: 'fitItem', params: {itemId: 'shield_booster'}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {fitted: true, slot: \"utility_1\"}}\n```\n\n**unfitItem** - Unfit module from ship\n```javascript\n{command: 'unfitItem', params: {itemId: 'shield_booster'}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {unfitted: true}}\n```\n\n### Debug/Cheat Commands\n\n**setPosition** - Teleport ship to coordinates\n```javascript\n{command: 'setPosition', params: {x: 1000, y: 0, z: 500}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {position: {x: 1000, y: 0, z: 500}}}\n```\n\n**addResource** - Add resources/items to inventory\n```javascript\n{command: 'addResource', params: {resourceId: 'isk', amount: 1000000}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {added: true, newAmount: 1000000}}\n```\n\n**triggerCombat** - Spawn enemy NPCs for testing\n```javascript\n{command: 'triggerCombat', params: {enemyType: 'pirate', count: 3}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {spawned: 3, enemies: []}}\n```\n\n### Utility Commands\n\n**resetGameState** - Reset game to initial state\n```javascript\n{command: 'resetGameState', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {reset: true}}\n```\n\n**executeBatch** - Execute multiple commands in sequence\n```javascript\n{command: 'executeBatch', params: {commands: [{command: 'dock', params: {}}, {command: 'getInventory', params: {}}]}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {results: []}}\n```\n\n**listCommands** - Get list of all available commands\n```javascript\n{command: 'listCommands', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {commands: [...]}}\n```\n\n## COMMANDS THAT DO NOT EXIST (Common Mistakes)\n\n**DO NOT USE THESE** - they are not implemented:\n- setNavigationTarget ❌\n- getNavigationState ❌\n- getInputState ❌\n- setAutopilot ❌\n- warpTo ❌\n- orbit ❌\n- approach ❌\n\nIf you need to test navigation/movement bugs, you MUST either:\n1.
