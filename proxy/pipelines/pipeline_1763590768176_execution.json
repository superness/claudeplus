This appears to be a complex automation system for a mining pool operation that needs to iterate through multiple stages sequentially.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First locate and read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand the specifications\n2. Find the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 implementation or scripts\n3. Examine the current pipeline structure to understand the sequential iteration mechanism\n4. Identify all 18 agents and 8 templates that need to be built\n5. Verify the execution order and dependencies between stages\n6. Execute the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 system\n7. Validate that all components are created correctly\n8. Test the sequential iteration through all stages\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use `Read` tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand specifications\n2) Use `Glob` tool with pattern \"**/meta-pipeline-builder*\" to locate the builder scripts\n3) Use `Glob` tool with patterns like \"**/pipeline*\", \"**/agent*\", \"**/automation*\" to find existing pipeline infrastructure\n4) Use `Read` tool to examine the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 implementation files\n5) Use `Grep` tool to search for agent definitions and template specifications across the codebase\n6) Use `Read` tool to examine configuration files in build/bin/Debug/config/ to understand the mining pool setup\n7) Use `Bash` tool to execute the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 with appropriate parameters\n8) Use `Grep` tool to verify all 18 agents were created (search for agent registration/initialization)\n9) Use `Grep` tool to verify all 8 pipeline templates were created\n10) Use `Read` tool to examine logs or output files from the pipeline execution\n11) Use `Bash` tool to run validation/test scripts if they exist\n12) Use `Grep` tool to check for any error messages or incomplete builds\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will verify that all 18 agents are created with correct configurations\n- Will verify that all 8 pipeline templates are instantiated properly\n- Will test that the sequential iteration progresses through all stages without skipping or repeating incorrectly\n- Will check for proper error handling if any stage fails\n- Will validate dependencies between stages are correctly resolved\n- Will ensure the pipeline can handle edge cases like missing configuration or interrupted execution\n- Will verify state persistence between pipeline stages\n- Will test rollback or recovery mechanisms if they exist\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will provide the contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the specifications\n- Will show the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 source code\n- Will capture execution logs showing all 18 agents being built\n- Will capture execution logs showing all 8 templates being created\n- Will provide directory listings showing created agent files/modules\n- Will show configuration files for each pipeline template\n- Will demonstrate sequential stage progression through logs or status output\n- Will provide test execution results validating the complete pipeline\n- Will show git diff if new files were created during the build process\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - This is a complex multi-stage automation system. While I can locate the documentation and execute the builder, there may be dependencies, environment requirements, or configuration needs that aren't immediately apparent. The actual execution success depends on whether the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 is complete and properly configured, and whether all prerequisites are in place. I'll need to discover the current state of implementation before executing.\n\nDECISION: PLAN_APPROVED",
