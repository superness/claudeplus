The game is fundamentally 2D (a 3x3 grid)\n2. The \"spectacular graphics\" are particle effects (best done with Canvas 2D API)\n3. User explicitly requested \"simple tic tac toe\"\n4.

Find the USER ENTRY POINT (e.g., useSkill method)\n2. Follow the chain: Does it IMPORT the system it needs? Does it CALL the method?\n3. Follow to the TARGET: Does the call actually reach the target object?\n4. Check for DISCONNECTS: Class exists but is never instantiated/imported/called\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n1. **Syntax Check**: Run TypeScript compiler or linter\n2. **Integration Path Tracing** (MOST IMPORTANT):\n   - Grep for the entry point method\n   - Read it and check: does it import and USE the dependent systems?\n   - If a CombatSystem exists, is it instantiated in Game.ts? Is it passed to Player?\n   - If Player.useSkill exists, does it call combatSystem.dealDamage()?\n3. **Disconnected Systems Check**:\n   - Look for classes that are defined but never imported elsewhere\n   - Look for methods that exist but are never called\n4. **Placeholder Detection**:\n   - Search for 'TODO', 'FIXME', 'placeholder', 'stub'\n   - Search for empty method bodies or hardcoded values that should be dynamic\n\n5. **Data Reference Validation** (CRITICAL):\n   - If code uses STRING IDs to reference templates (e.g., 'IMP_HENCH_MEDIC'), verify the ID EXISTS\n   - Grep for the string in the template definition files\n   - Example: Game.ts uses addCompanion('IMP_HENCH_MEDIC') → check CompanionTemplates.ts has template_code: 'IMP_HENCH_MEDIC'\n   - Common pattern: implementer invents ID names that don't match actual template definitions\n   - This is a SILENT FAILURE - code compiles but feature doesn't work\n\n## Output Format\n\n## Test Results\n\n### Syntax Check\n[Pass/Fail]\n\n### Integration Path Verification\n[For the implemented feature, trace the FULL path]\n- Entry point: [method name]\n- Calls: [what it calls]\n- Reaches target: [YES/NO - does the action complete?]\n- **CONNECTED: YES/NO**\n\n### Disconnected Systems Found\n[List any classes/methods that exist but aren't wired up]\n\n### Placeholder Code Found\n[Any TODOs or stubs that need implementation]\n\n### Issues Found\n[CRITICAL: List integration failures first]\n\nDECISION: has_issues (if integration paths are broken or systems disconnected)\nDECISION: working (ONLY if integration paths are fully connected and working)\n\n=== ROUTING DECISION REQUIRED ===\nAfter your response, you MUST choose exactly ONE decision from:\n- has_issues: Go to fix_issues\n- working: Go to integration_test\n\n**CRITICAL**: Your VERY LAST LINE must be exactly:\nDECISION: [ONE_OF_THE_ABOVE_CHOICES]\nExample: DECISION: has_issues\nDo NOT add explanations after the decision keyword.\n",
