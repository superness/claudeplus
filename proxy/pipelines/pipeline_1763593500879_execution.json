This agent will manage Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode, including installation verification, configuration generation, daemon control, status queries, block generation, and wallet management. The agent JSON should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications\n2. Review existing agent examples to understand the JSON structure and pattern\n3. Design the agent with appropriate prompts, tools, and decision logic\n4. Create comprehensive prompt that covers all required bitcoin daemon management capabilities\n5. Define proper tool permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)\n6. Define decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)\n7. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 2.1\n2) Use Glob tool with pattern \"**/agents/*.json\" to find existing agent examples\n3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand structure\n4) Design agent prompt that includes:\n   - Bitcoin daemon installation verification (checking for bitcoind binary)\n   - Regtest configuration file generation (bitcoin.conf with regtest settings)\n   - Daemon start commands with proper regtest flags\n   - Graceful daemon shutdown procedures\n   - RPC commands for status queries (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)\n   - Block generation functionality (generatetoaddress)\n   - Wallet creation and funding in regtest mode\n5) Define tool permissions array: [\"Read\", \"Write\", \"Edit\", \"Bash\", \"Glob\", \"Grep\"]\n6) Define decisions array: [\"daemon_started\", \"daemon_stopped\", \"daemon_error\", \"error\"]\n7) Structure the complete agent JSON with:\n   - name: \"bitcoin_daemon_manager\"\n   - description: Summary of agent capabilities\n   - prompt: Detailed instructions for bitcoin daemon management\n   - tools: Permission array\n   - decisions: Decision points array\n8) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json with complete agent definition\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Plan will verify section 2.1 content exists and is complete in the plan document\n- Will ensure agent structure matches existing agent patterns from examples\n- Will include handling for bitcoind not being installed (installation verification)\n- Will include error handling for daemon start failures\n- Will include proper RPC connection handling and timeouts\n- Will include validation of regtest mode configuration\n- Will consider edge cases like daemon already running, port conflicts, data directory issues\n- Will ensure wallet creation handles existing wallets gracefully\n- Will verify generatetoaddress handles different block counts and addresses\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will reference specific content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1\n- Will show structure comparison with existing agent examples\n- Will provide the complete agent JSON with all required fields\n- Will demonstrate that all requirements are addressed in the prompt:\n  * Installation verification steps\n  * Configuration generation commands\n  * Start/stop procedures\n  * Status query RPC calls\n  * Block generation commands\n  * Wallet creation/funding commands\n- Will confirm tool permissions match requirements\n- Will confirm decision points match requirements\n- Will validate JSON syntax is correct\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a structured task with clear requirements and existing patterns to follow. Reading the plan document and existing agents will provide clear guidance for creating the new agent JSON with appropriate prompts and configuration.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT: This is a well-structured plan for creating a bitcoin daemon manager agent. Let me evaluate each aspect:\n\n**Understanding**: The plan correctly identifies that this is about creating an agent JSON file that manages Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode. All key requirements are captured: installation verification, configuration generation, daemon control, status queries, block generation, and wallet management.\n\n**Approach Logic**: The 8-step approach is methodical and logical:\n- Steps 1-3: Research phase (read plan document + examine existing agent examples)\n- Steps 4-6: Design phase (create prompt, define permissions and decisions)\n- Steps 7-8: Implementation phase (structure JSON and write to file)\n\nThis follows a good pattern of understanding requirements → learning from examples → designing → implementing.\n\n**Specific Evidence Proposed**:\nThe plan proposes multiple concrete pieces of evidence:\n1. Reference to specific content from section 2.1 of the plan document\n2. Structure comparison with existing agent JSON examples\n3. The complete agent JSON file itself\n4. Demonstration that all 8 requirements are addressed in the prompt (with specific checklist)\n5. Confirmation of tool permissions matching requirements\n6. Confirmation of decision points matching requirements\n7. JSON syntax validation\n\n**Test Considerations**: The plan shows thoughtful consideration of edge cases:\n- Daemon already running\n- Port conflicts\n- Data directory issues\n- Existing wallets\n- Installation verification\n- Error handling for start failures\n- RPC connection handling\n\n**Potential Concerns**:\n1. The plan doesn't specify *how* it will demonstrate that the prompt adequately covers each requirement - it just says \"Will demonstrate\" but doesn't detail the verification method\n2. No mention of testing the generated JSON (e.g., validating it against a schema or attempting to load it)\n3. The \"structure comparison with existing agents\" is mentioned but not detailed about what specifically will be compared\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Clear step-by-step execution plan\n- All required fields identified (tools, decisions, prompt content)\n- Good awareness of edge cases\n- High confidence is justified given this is a structured file creation task with existing patterns\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong - The plan will produce:\n- A complete, syntactically valid JSON file at the specified path\n- A prompt covering all 8 stated requirements\n- Proper tool permissions and decision arrays\n- Can be verified by examining the final JSON file content\n\nThe evidence is tangible and verifiable. The final JSON file can be inspected to confirm it contains all required elements.\n\n**Minor Improvement Suggestions** (not blocking):\n- Could specify using a JSON validator to confirm syntax\n- Could be more explicit about prompt structure (how instructions will be organized)\n\nDECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)",
