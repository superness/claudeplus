The agent needs to parse and analyze logs from multiple sources (bitcoind debug.log, CoiniumServ logs, miner output), identify errors/warnings, correlate events, and generate a unified timeline. The agent definition must be written as a JSON file to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.4 specifications\n2. Examine the existing agent structure by looking at other agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory\n3. Identify the log file locations for bitcoind, CoiniumServ, and miners from the codebase\n4. Design the agent JSON with appropriate tools (Read, Grep, Bash), permissions, and decision points\n5. Structure the agent to handle log parsing, error detection, event correlation, and timeline generation\n6. Write the complete agent JSON configuration file\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Glob to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md: `pattern: \"**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\"`\n2) Use Read to examine section 2.4 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md for detailed specifications\n3) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files: `pattern: \"**/claudeplus/agents/*.json\"`\n4) Use Read to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand the structure, format, and patterns\n5) Use Grep to search for log file paths in the codebase: `pattern: \"debug\\.log|\\.log\"` with appropriate filters\n6) Use Grep to find CoiniumServ logging configuration: `pattern: \"log|Log|logging\" type: \"cs\"`\n7) Design the agent JSON structure including:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Tool permissions (Read, Grep, Bash)\n   - Decision points (logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error)\n   - Prompt instructions for log parsing, error identification, correlation, and timeline generation\n8) Use Write to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json with the complete agent definition\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will ensure the agent can handle missing log files (bitcoind not running, CoiniumServ not started)\n- Will design error handling for corrupted or incomplete log entries\n- Will account for different log formats across components\n- Will test correlation logic with asynchronous events across different logs\n- Will handle large log files efficiently (using Grep with filters rather than reading entire files)\n- Will validate that all four decision points (logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error) are properly defined and reachable\n- Will ensure the agent can generate meaningful timelines even with partial log data\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will show the contents of section 2.4 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Will reference the structure of existing agent JSON files\n- Will document the identified log file locations from the codebase\n- Will provide the complete log_analyzer.json file content\n- Will verify the JSON is valid and contains all required fields (tools, permissions, decisions, prompt)\n- Will confirm the file is written to the correct path\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a well-defined task with clear requirements. The challenge is ensuring the agent design properly handles the complexity of multi-source log correlation and timeline generation. Success depends on understanding the existing agent framework structure and the actual log formats used by bitcoind, CoiniumServ, and miners. The provided permissions and decision points give clear boundaries for the agent's capabilities.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",

Logical approach: Read spec → Examine existing agents → Find log locations → Design agent → Write JSON\n3. Comprehensive scope: Covers all required components (bitcoind, CoiniumServ, miner logs)\n4. Good error handling considerations: Missing files, corrupted logs, different formats\n5. Performance awareness: Notes using Grep for large files rather than full reads\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Critical Missing Step**: No verification that the written JSON is actually valid and loadable\n2. **Vague Evidence**: \"Will show contents of section 2.4\" - but no commitment to demonstrate the agent actually works or can be loaded\n3. **No Concrete Success Criteria**: How will we know the agent JSON is correctly structured? Just writing a file isn't proof it works\n4. **Missing Validation**: No plan to validate against a schema or test the agent can actually be invoked\n5. **Incomplete Test Strategy**: \"Test considerations\" are theoretical - no actual test execution planned\n6. **Confidence Mismatch**: \"Medium-High\" confidence but acknowledges significant complexity in log correlation without showing how that complexity will be addressed\n\n**Evidence Quality Issues:**\n- \"Will show contents\" - passive, not verifiable\n- \"Will reference structure\" - vague\n- \"Will document identified locations\" - descriptive, not proof of function\n- \"Will provide complete content\" - existence ≠ correctness\n- \"Will verify JSON is valid\" - HOW? No validation method specified\n- \"Will confirm file written\" - trivial proof, doesn't validate functionality\n\n**Missing Critical Evidence:**\n1. No example of parsing actual log entries to prove the agent can handle real data\n2. No demonstration that the decision points are correctly triggered\n3. No validation that the JSON schema matches the agent framework requirements\n4. No proof the correlation logic would actually work with real logs\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe proposed evidence proves file creation but NOT functional correctness. There's no concrete plan to demonstrate:\n- The JSON structure is valid for the agent framework\n- The agent can actually parse real log formats\n- The correlation and timeline generation logic is sound\n- The decision points correctly route based on findings\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasons:**\n1. **Insufficient verification**: Plan must include validating the JSON against existing agent framework requirements, potentially by attempting to load/parse it\n2. **No functional proof**: Must demonstrate with actual log samples or existing logs that the designed agent can perform its core functions\n3. **Vague success criteria**: Need concrete, measurable criteria like \"JSON passes schema validation\" or \"Agent successfully parses sample bitcoind debug.log entry\"\n4. **Missing implementation details**: Log parsing patterns, error detection regex/logic, correlation algorithm not specified - these should be detailed enough to verify they'll work\n\n**Required Revisions:**\n- Add step to validate JSON structure (parse it, compare to schema, or test-load it)\n- Include specific log format examples and how the agent will parse them\n- Define concrete error patterns the agent will detect\n- Specify the correlation algorithm with enough detail to verify correctness\n- Add validation step showing the agent can handle a real log snippet\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

The agent needs to parse and analyze logs from bitcoind (debug.log), CoiniumServ pool server, and mining software, identify errors/warnings, correlate events across different log sources, and generate unified timelines. The agent should output to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json with specific decisions: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error.\n\nAPPROACH: I will design a complete agent specification following the established pattern from existing agents (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager) while incorporating the specific requirements from section 2.4 of the plan. The agent will need to handle multiple log sources, perform pattern matching, event correlation, timeline generation, and support the required decisions for pipeline integration.\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read section 2.4 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (already completed - lines 406-426)\n2) Examine existing log_analyzer.json in build/bin/Debug/config/agents/ (already completed - basic structure exists)\n3) Review bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and pool_server_manager.json to understand the agent JSON schema pattern (already completed)\n4) Identify log file locations: bitcoind debug.log (~/.bitcoin/regtest/debug.log), CoiniumServ logs (build/bin/Debug/logs/), miner output locations\n5) Design the complete agent JSON with:\n   - Comprehensive configuration for all log sources (bitcoind, CoiniumServ, miner)\n   - Log parsing capabilities with regex patterns for errors/warnings\n   - Event correlation logic across multiple log sources\n   - Timeline generation functionality\n   - Decision outputs: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error\n   - RPC endpoints for log queries\n   - Error pattern definitions for each component\n   - Dependencies on other agents (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager)\n6) Include helper script references (parse-logs.sh) even though they don't exist yet\n7) Add comprehensive error handling and logging configuration\n8) Include metrics collection for log analysis performance\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Test with empty log files (no logs available scenario) → should return logs_analyzed with no_errors\n- Test with bitcoind debug.log containing RPC errors → should detect errors and return errors_found\n- Test with CoiniumServ logs containing stratum connection failures → should identify and correlate\n- Test with miner output showing share rejections → should parse and flag warnings\n- Test correlation across logs (e.g., daemon RPC error correlated with pool connection failure) → should create unified timeline showing cause-effect\n- Test with very large log files (100MB+) → should handle efficiently with pagination/streaming\n- Test with missing log files → should report which logs are unavailable\n- Test with malformed log entries → should skip invalid entries gracefully\n- Test real-time log monitoring vs historical analysis modes\n- Test decision routing: logs_analyzed → successful parse, errors_found → critical issues detected, no_errors → clean logs, error → agent failure\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Complete JSON agent specification file at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json\n- Agent will include specific log file paths based on actual system layout (verified ~/.bitcoin/regtest/debug.log exists)\n- Configuration sections for each log source (bitcoind, CoiniumServ, miner)\n- Error pattern arrays with regex patterns for each component type\n- Event correlation rules with cross-log matching\n- Timeline output format specification\n- All four required decisions defined: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error\n- RPC endpoints for querying parsed logs, searching patterns, generating reports\n- Dependencies correctly mapped to bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager\n- Helper script references to parse-logs.sh for extensibility\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - I have clear requirements from section 2.4, existing agent patterns to follow from bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and pool_server_manager.json, verified log file locations, and understand the mining cycle components.
