The pipeline has 7 stages with specific agent assignments and transitions. The file needs to be written to a claudeplus/templates directory that doesn't exist yet.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. Examine existing pipeline JSON examples in the codebase to understand the expected format\n2. Review section 3.1 lines 475-490 which defines the daemon-pool-integration pipeline structure\n3. Create the pipeline JSON following the standard format with all 7 stages and their transitions\n4. Ensure each stage references the correct agent from the plan\n5. Create the directory structure if needed and write the complete JSON file\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Use Glob to search for existing pipeline JSON files in the repository: `**/*.json` with focus on templates or pipeline directories to understand the JSON schema\n2. Use Grep to search for \"pipeline\" or \"agent\" in JSON files to find example structures: `pattern: \"\\\"agent\\\"|\\\"transitions\\\"|\\\"stages\\\"\"` with `type: \"json\"` and `output_mode: \"content\"`\n3. Read any example pipeline files found to understand the exact format required\n4. Based on section 3.1 (lines 475-490), construct the JSON with:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, purpose)\n   - 7 stages array with: start_daemon, configure_pool_rpc, start_pool, test_rpc_calls, generate_test_block, validate_template, rpc_integration_verified\n   - Each stage mapping to its agent: bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, pool_server_manager, rpc_tester, bitcoin_daemon_manager, daemon_pool_connector\n   - Transitions between stages in sequential order\n   - Success criteria from the plan\n5. Create the directory `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` using Bash: `mkdir -p /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates`\n6. Write the complete JSON file to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/daemon-pool-integration.json` using Write tool\n7. Verify the file was created correctly with Read tool\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Validate JSON syntax is correct (proper escaping, comma placement, bracket matching)\n- Ensure all 7 stages are present with correct agent assignments\n- Verify transitions flow correctly from stage 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → END\n- Check that stage IDs match the transition targets\n- Confirm the pipeline structure matches similar pipelines in the plan (Appendix C example)\n- Test that the directory creation works even if parent directories don't exist\n- Handle the case where claudeplus directory may not exist\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Provide the exact JSON structure created showing all 7 stages\n- Show directory listing confirming the file was created at the correct path\n- Display file size and basic validation that JSON is well-formed\n- Reference line numbers from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing alignment with section 3.1\n- Show the complete file content to verify all required elements are present\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - The requirements are clearly specified in section 3.1 with exact stage names, agent assignments, and success criteria. The plan also includes example JSON structures in Appendix C (lines 959-970) showing the expected format. The task is straightforward file creation with well-defined inputs.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Understanding**: The design correctly identifies the task - creating a pipeline JSON file based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md with 7 specific stages\n2. **Logical Approach**: The plan follows a sensible sequence: examine examples → understand format → construct JSON → create directory → write file → verify\n3. **Comprehensive Steps**: All necessary steps are included, from format discovery to directory creation to file verification\n4. **Specific References**: The plan references exact line numbers (475-490, 959-970) from the source document\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n1. **Missing Prerequisite Reading**: The plan doesn't include reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md first to verify the actual content of section 3.1. This is a MAJOR gap - the designer is making assumptions about what the document contains without confirming it exists or reading its actual content\n2. **Unverified Source Material**: While line numbers are mentioned, there's no step to actually read those specific sections to confirm the stage definitions, agent assignments, and success criteria\n3. **Weak Evidence for JSON Schema**: The plan proposes searching for example pipelines, but doesn't guarantee finding any or specify what to do if none exist\n4. **Directory Path Assumption**: Creates `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` without verifying if this is the correct location relative to the current working directory (`/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ`)\n5. **No Validation of Completeness**: While the plan mentions verifying JSON syntax, it doesn't specify how to validate that all required fields from section 3.1 are included\n\n**Evidence Quality Issues:**\n- Evidence relies on \"showing\" content but doesn't specify comparison against source requirements\n- No explicit validation step to confirm the JSON matches ALL specifications in section 3.1\n- Missing: Reading the actual source document as the first step\n- Missing: Explicit validation checklist against section 3.1 requirements\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe proposed evidence (JSON structure, directory listing, file content) is superficial. Strong evidence would include:\n1. Side-by-side comparison of created JSON against section 3.1 requirements\n2. Validation that each of the 7 stages has all required fields per the specification\n3. Confirmation that agent assignments match the plan exactly\n4. Verification that transitions match the specified flow diagram\n\n**Fatal Flaw**: The plan doesn't start by reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to confirm what section 3.1 actually contains. This is building on assumption rather than verified requirements.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasons for Rejection:**\n1. Must read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (especially section 3.1, lines 475-490) as the FIRST step before any other action\n2. Must verify the document exists and contains the expected pipeline specification\n3. Must explicitly validate the created JSON against each requirement listed in section 3.1\n4. Must confirm the target directory path is correct for the intended purpose\n5. Evidence collection must include concrete verification against source requirements, not just \"displaying\" the created file\n\n**Required Revisions:**\n- Add Step 0: Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to verify it exists and understand section 3.1 completely\n- Add explicit validation step: Compare created JSON against every requirement in section 3.1\n- Specify what to do if example pipelines aren't found\n- Justify the target directory path `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` or verify it with the user\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

The pipeline has 7 specific stages with defined flow from start_daemon through to rpc_integration_verified, and the output should be written as JSON to a specific path.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1 and get context on the pipeline architecture, stage definitions, and any specific requirements\n2. Examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the expected JSON schema and structure\n3. Map the 7 stages provided to the correct JSON format with proper stage configurations, dependencies, and component references\n4. Validate the pipeline structure matches the specification in section 3.1\n5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified output path\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and locate section 3.1 for detailed specifications\n2. Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files: `templates/**/*.json` or `**/*pipeline*.json`\n3. Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure\n4. Based on the documentation and examples, design the JSON structure with:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - 7 stages defined with: stage name, component reference, inputs, outputs, dependencies\n   - Stage flow: start_daemon → configure_pool_rpc → start_pool → test_rpc_calls → generate_test_block → validate_template → rpc_integration_verified\n5. Map each stage to its component:\n   - start_daemon: bitcoin_daemon_manager\n   - configure_pool_rpc: config_generator\n   - start_pool: pool_server_manager\n   - test_rpc_calls: rpc_tester\n   - generate_test_block: bitcoin_daemon_manager\n   - validate_template: daemon_pool_connector\n   - rpc_integration_verified: END condition\n6. Define dependencies between stages to ensure proper sequential execution\n7. Add error handling, timeout configurations, and validation criteria per stage based on section 3.1 requirements\n8. Verify the output directory exists: use Bash `ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/`\n9. Write the complete JSON structure to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/daemon-pool-integration.json using Write tool\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will validate that the pipeline JSON follows the exact stage order specified (1-7)\n- Will ensure all component references (bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, etc.) match the naming conventions from existing pipelines\n- Will verify stage dependencies are correctly chained so each stage waits for its predecessor\n- Will check that the END stage (rpc_integration_verified) properly terminates the pipeline\n- Will validate JSON syntax is correct and can be parsed\n- Will ensure the file path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists before writing\n- Will consider edge cases like stage failures, timeouts, and retry logic based on section 3.1 specifications\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will provide the content of section 3.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the source specifications\n- Will show examples of existing pipeline JSON structure for schema reference\n- Will display the complete generated daemon-pool-integration.json with all 7 stages properly configured\n- Will show directory listing confirming the output file location exists\n- Will verify the JSON is valid and matches the required stage flow\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - While the stage flow and components are clearly specified, I need to review section 3.1 of the documentation and existing pipeline examples to ensure the JSON schema, stage parameters, error handling, and component configurations match the project's standards. The complexity depends on what additional metadata and configuration each stage requires beyond the basic flow.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",

This is concerning for a structural implementation task.\n2. **Missing Verification Steps**: While the plan mentions validation, it doesn't specify:\n   - How to verify the generated JSON is actually valid for the target system\n   - Whether there's a schema validator or test harness to run\n   - What happens if section 3.1 is missing or incomplete\n3. **Incomplete Test Strategy**: TEST_CONSIDERATIONS mentions checking many things but doesn't explain HOW these validations will be performed (manual review vs automated validation)\n4. **Path Assumption**: Assumes `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` exists without first verifying it\n5. **No Rollback Plan**: No mention of what to do if the documentation or examples are insufficient\n\n**Evidence Quality Analysis:**\nThe proposed evidence is **partially strong**:\n- ✅ Will show source documentation (section 3.1)\n- ✅ Will show example pipeline structures\n- ✅ Will display complete generated JSON\n- ✅ Will verify directory exists\n- ❌ **MISSING**: No concrete proof that the generated JSON actually works (no test execution, validation run, or system integration check)\n- ❌ **MISSING**: No diff comparison between generated output and expected structure from section 3.1\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe evidence focuses on \"what was created\" but not \"whether it works correctly\". Reading docs and showing output is not sufficient proof that the pipeline JSON will function as intended in the actual system. There's no proposed validation against a schema, no test run of the pipeline, no comparison with section 3.1 requirements beyond manual review.\n\n**Critical Gap**: The plan doesn't address how to PROVE the pipeline JSON is correct according to section 3.1 beyond human inspection.

The \"Medium\" confidence combined with weak evidence quality (no automated validation, no test execution, no schema verification) means there's insufficient assurance the task will be completed correctly. The plan needs:\n1. Specific validation criteria from section 3.1 to check against\n2. A method to test or validate the generated JSON (schema validator, dry-run, or integration test)\n3. Higher confidence backed by concrete understanding of the JSON structure requirements\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

First read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1 specifications\n2. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON structure and schema\n3. Design the pipeline JSON with 7 stages following the specified flow\n4. Ensure each stage references the correct component (bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, pool_server_manager, rpc_tester, daemon_pool_connector)\n5. Define appropriate stage dependencies to enforce the sequential execution order\n6. Write the complete JSON to the specified path\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract section 3.1 specifications: `Read tool on MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`\n2) List existing pipeline templates to understand JSON schema: `Glob tool with pattern \"**/*.json\" in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/`\n3) Read 1-2 example pipeline JSONs to understand structure: `Read tool on example template files`\n4) Design pipeline JSON structure including:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - 7 stages array with: start_daemon, configure_pool_rpc, start_pool, test_rpc_calls, generate_test_block, validate_template, rpc_integration_verified\n   - Each stage definition with: id, name, component, dependencies, parameters, timeout, retry_policy\n   - Stage dependencies: stage2 depends on stage1, stage3 on stage2, etc.\n   - Component mappings to: bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, pool_server_manager, rpc_tester, daemon_pool_connector\n5) Verify /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory exists: `Bash ls command`\n6) Write complete pipeline JSON: `Write tool to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/daemon-pool-integration.json`\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will verify section 3.1 exists and contains daemon-pool-integration specifications\n- Will handle if template directory structure differs from expected\n- Will ensure JSON schema matches existing pipeline templates (if any exist)\n- Will validate all 7 stages are properly sequenced with correct dependencies\n- Will ensure component names match exactly as specified\n- Will handle case where /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ doesn't exist (may need to create it)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 showing pipeline specifications\n- Example pipeline JSON structures from existing templates\n- Final daemon-pool-integration.json file content showing all 7 stages with proper structure\n- Directory listing confirming file creation at specified path\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - Need to verify MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and contains section 3.1, and understand the expected JSON schema from existing templates.
