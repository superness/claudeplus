The agent needs to handle installation, configuration, daemon lifecycle, status queries, block generation, and wallet management.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications\n2. Review existing agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory to understand the agent structure/schema\n3. Design the agent with appropriate instructions, tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), and decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)\n4. Structure the agent to handle all required Bitcoin daemon operations in regtest mode\n5. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` directory structure and existing agent files to understand the JSON schema\n2. Use Read tool to read `MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` and specifically examine section 2.1 for bitcoin_daemon_manager specifications\n3. Use Glob tool to find example agent JSON files: `claudeplus/agents/*.json`\n4. Use Read tool on 1-2 example agent files to understand the complete structure (instructions, tools, decisions, parameters, etc.)\n5. Design the agent JSON with:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Detailed instructions covering: bitcoind installation verification, regtest config generation, daemon start/stop, status queries (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo), block generation (generatetoaddress), wallet creation/funding\n   - Tools array: [\"Read\", \"Write\", \"Edit\", \"Bash\", \"Glob\", \"Grep\"]\n   - Decisions array with routing: [\"daemon_started\", \"daemon_stopped\", \"daemon_error\", \"error\"]\n   - Any required parameters or environment variables\n6. Use Write tool to create the complete agent JSON at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json`\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Agent instructions will handle fresh installation scenarios (bitcoind not present)\n- Agent will verify existing bitcoind installations\n- Agent will handle daemon already running scenarios\n- Agent will include error handling for failed daemon starts\n- Agent will gracefully handle stop requests when daemon isn't running\n- Agent will include RPC connection error handling\n- Agent will handle wallet creation conflicts (wallet already exists)\n- Agent will include proper regtest configuration (no mainnet/testnet conflicts)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will provide the content read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1\n- Will show example agent JSON structure from existing agents\n- Will provide the complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json file content\n- Will verify file was written to correct path using Bash ls command\n- Will validate JSON structure matches the schema used by other agents\n\nCONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined task with clear requirements, available reference materials (the automation plan and existing agent examples), and straightforward JSON file creation using available tools.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. Clear understanding of requirements - the plan correctly identifies all needed capabilities (installation, configuration, lifecycle management, status queries, block generation, wallet operations)\n2. Logical approach - starts by reading specifications and existing examples before creating the new agent\n3. Includes reference to authoritative source (MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1)\n4. Considers edge cases and error scenarios (daemon already running, wallet conflicts, RPC errors)\n5. All required tools are properly identified\n6. All required decisions are included\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. **No verification of JSON validity** - The plan writes JSON but doesn't validate it's syntactically correct\n2. **Missing schema validation** - While it reads example agents, there's no explicit step to validate the created agent matches the required schema\n3. **No functional testing** - Evidence only covers \"file was written\" but doesn't prove the agent will actually work when executed\n4. **Weak evidence for completeness** - Simply providing file content doesn't prove it meets ALL requirements from section 2.1\n\n**Evidence Quality Issues:**\n- \"Will provide content read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1\" - Good, but doesn't prove implementation matches specs\n- \"Will show example agent JSON structure\" - Good reference, but doesn't prove adherence\n- \"Will provide complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json file content\" - This is just showing output, not proving correctness\n- \"Will verify file was written using ls\" - Trivial check, doesn't prove quality\n- \"Will validate JSON structure matches schema\" - Mentioned but no concrete method specified\n\n**Missing Concrete Evidence:**\n- No checksum or line-by-line verification that all section 2.1 requirements are addressed\n- No comparison table: \"Requirement X → Implementation Y\"\n- No syntax validation step (e.g., using `jq` or Python to parse JSON)\n- No field-by-field schema compliance check\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe proposed evidence proves file creation but NOT correctness, completeness, or functional validity. The plan lacks verifiable checkpoints that each requirement from section 2.1 is implemented. Simply showing \"the file content\" is insufficient - there's no methodology to prove that content is correct, complete, or will function as intended.\n\n**Specific Concerns:**\n- How will we verify ALL daemon operations are covered in instructions?\n- How will we prove the decision routing is correct?\n- How will we verify the agent JSON is valid and parseable?\n- What proves the instructions are clear enough to execute successfully?\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Reasoning:** While the approach is sound, the evidence collection is insufficient. The plan conflates \"creating a file\" with \"creating a CORRECT file.\" There's no concrete verification methodology to prove the agent JSON:\n1. Is syntactically valid JSON\n2. Conforms to the agent schema\n3. Implements ALL requirements from section 2.1\n4. Will successfully execute when loaded\n\nThe plan needs explicit validation steps with pass/fail criteria, not just \"show the output.\"",

      "output": "Perfect! Now I have all the context I need to create the plan:\n\n---\n\n**UNDERSTANDING:** User wants me to create a comprehensive plan for building the `bitcoin_daemon_manager` agent based on section 2.1 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document. The agent needs to manage Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode, including installation verification, configuration generation, daemon start/stop operations, RPC status queries, block generation, and wallet management. The agent JSON file must be written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json` with specific permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision keywords (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error).\n\n**APPROACH:** I will create a detailed plan for building the bitcoin_daemon_manager agent by:\n1. Analyzing the specification in section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n2. Examining the existing bitcoin_daemon_manager.json structure from the SuperCoinServ project\n3. Reviewing the claudeplus agent pattern (browser_commander.json)\n4. Synthesizing requirements into a comprehensive agent definition\n5. Planning the agent capabilities, system prompt, tools, and validation criteria\n6. Structuring the JSON to match claudeplus agent patterns while incorporating Bitcoin daemon management requirements\n\n**STEPS:**\n1. **Read section 2.1 specification** - Already completed, located at lines 115-138 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n2. **Extract required capabilities from specification**:\n   - Install/verify bitcoind installation\n   - Generate regtest configuration  \n   - Start daemon with proper flags\n   - Stop daemon gracefully\n   - Query daemon status (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)\n   - Generate test blocks (generatetoaddress)\n   - Create/fund regtest wallets\n3. **Map success criteria from specification** (lines 133-137):\n   - Can start daemon from cold state\n   - Can generate 101 blocks (mature coinbase)\n   - RPC interface responds correctly\n   - Clean shutdown with no corruption\n4. **Examine existing agent structure** - Review the SuperCoinServ bitcoin_daemon_manager.json for configuration patterns, RPC settings, daemon arguments, health checks\n5. **Design agent JSON structure** using claudeplus pattern:\n   - `id`: \"bitcoin_daemon_manager\"\n   - `name`: descriptive name\n   - `role`: single-line role description\n   - `expertise`: array of specialized capabilities\n   - `systemPrompt`: comprehensive instructions for daemon management\n   - `outputFormat`: \"markdown\"\n   - `validationCriteria`: success criteria from spec\n   - `requiredTools`: [\"Bash\", \"Read\", \"Write\", \"Edit\", \"Glob\", \"Grep\"]\n   - Additional fields: decisions, configuration details\n6. **Structure systemPrompt** to include:\n   - Role introduction and purpose\n   - Installation verification procedures\n   - Configuration file generation (bitcoin.conf for regtest)\n   - Daemon lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)\n   - RPC connectivity and authentication\n   - Status query commands (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo, getblockcount)\n   - Block generation commands (generatetoaddress)\n   - Wallet operations (createwallet, loadwallet, getnewaddress, getbalance)\n   - Error handling and recovery procedures\n   - Decision keyword usage (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)\n7. **Define expertise array** covering:\n   - Bitcoin Core daemon management\n   - Regtest mode configuration\n   - RPC interface operations\n   - Wallet management\n   - Block generation for testing\n   - Process lifecycle control\n   - Error detection and recovery\n8. **Create validationCriteria** matching success criteria:\n   - \"Daemon starts successfully from cold state\"\n   - \"Can generate 101+ blocks for mature coinbase\"\n   - \"RPC interface responds to queries correctly\"\n   - \"Clean shutdown with no data corruption\"\n   - \"Wallet creation and funding works correctly\"\n9. **Add decisions object** with required keywords:\n   ```json\n   \"decisions\": [\"daemon_started\", \"daemon_stopped\", \"daemon_error\", \"error\"]\n   ```\n10. **Include configuration section** with:\n    - Default bitcoind paths\n    - Regtest network settings\n    - RPC configuration (host, port, username, password)\n    - Data directory paths\n    - Common daemon arguments\n11. **Write complete JSON** to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json` using Write tool\n12. **Validate JSON structure** by reading back the file to ensure proper formatting\n\n**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**\nThe plan will address these test scenarios:\n- **Cold start test**: Agent must verify bitcoind installation, generate config if missing, and start daemon from completely stopped state\n- **Configuration generation test**: Agent must create valid bitcoin.conf with correct regtest settings, RPC credentials, and ports\n- **RPC connectivity test**: Agent must successfully connect to RPC interface using bitcoin-cli or curl, handling authentication\n- **Block generation test**: Agent must execute `generatetoaddress 101 <address>` to create mature coinbase transactions\n- **Wallet operations test**: Agent must create wallet, generate addresses, check balances, and verify funding\n- **Graceful shutdown test**: Agent must use `bitcoin-cli stop` and verify clean daemon termination\n- **Error handling test**: Agent must detect and report various errors (port conflicts, authentication failures, already running daemon, RPC timeouts)\n- **Status query test**: Agent must successfully call getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo, getbalance and parse responses\n- **Edge cases**: Handle missing bitcoind, corrupted data directory, network mismatch, insufficient permissions\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\nI will collect the following evidence to validate the plan:\n1. **Complete agent JSON file** written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json`\n2. **Specification compliance checklist**:\n   - ✓ All 7 capabilities from section 2.1 included in systemPrompt\n   - ✓ All 4 success criteria mapped to validationCriteria\n   - ✓ Required tools specified (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep)\n   - ✓ All 4 decision keywords defined\n3. **JSON structure validation**:\n   - ✓ Valid JSON syntax (no parsing errors)\n   - ✓ Matches claudeplus agent pattern (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, etc.)\n   - ✓ Comprehensive systemPrompt with detailed instructions\n   - ✓ All required fields present\n4. **File path verification**: Confirm file exists at exact path `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json`\n5. **Content verification**: Read back file and verify all sections are present and correctly structured\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** High\n\n**Reasoning for high confidence:**\n1. Clear specification in MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 with explicit capabilities and success criteria\n2. Existing reference implementation in SuperCoinServ project showing configuration patterns\n3. Well-established claudeplus agent pattern from browser_commander.json\n4. Straightforward task of synthesizing requirements into JSON structure\n5. All required information available (capabilities, tools, decisions, validation criteria)\n6. No complex algorithms or uncertain technical challenges - primarily structured data creation\n7. Clear validation approach (read file back, check structure, verify compliance with spec)\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\nThe design specification is exceptionally thorough and demonstrates deep understanding of the requirements. The plan correctly identifies all key aspects:\n\n1. **Understanding**: Correctly interprets the need to create a bitcoin_daemon_manager agent based on section 2.1, with all specified capabilities (install/verify, config generation, daemon lifecycle, RPC queries, block generation, wallet management).\n\n2. **Approach**: Methodical and logical - starts with analyzing existing specifications and patterns, then synthesizes requirements into the claudeplus agent JSON structure. The decision to reference both the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md specification and existing patterns (browser_commander.json, SuperCoinServ bitcoin_daemon_manager.json) shows good research strategy.\n\n3. **Steps**: The 12-step plan is concrete and well-sequenced:\n   - Steps 1-4: Requirements gathering and capability extraction\n   - Steps 5-9: Agent structure design with all required fields\n   - Steps 10-11: Configuration and file writing\n   - Step 12: Validation\n\n4. **Specificity**: The plan includes specific details:\n   - Exact line numbers (115-138, 133-137)\n   - Specific JSON fields with examples (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, etc.)\n   - All 7 capabilities enumerated\n   - All 4 success criteria mapped\n   - All 4 decision keywords listed\n   - Exact file path specified\n\n5. **Test Considerations**: Comprehensive coverage of test scenarios including cold start, RPC connectivity, block generation, wallet operations, graceful shutdown, error handling, and edge cases. This demonstrates understanding of real-world usage patterns.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**\n\nThe evidence collection plan is exceptionally robust:\n\n1. **Primary deliverable**: Complete agent JSON file at exact specified path\n2. **Specification compliance checklist**: Maps all 7 capabilities, 4 success criteria, required tools, and decision keywords to implementation\n3. **Technical validation**: JSON syntax validation and structure verification\n4. **File verification**: Path existence check\n5. **Content verification**: Read-back validation to confirm all sections present\n\nThe evidence is:\n- **Concrete**: Actual file with specific content requirements\n- **Verifiable**: Can be checked programmatically (JSON parsing, field presence)\n- **Comprehensive**: Covers both structure and content\n- **Traceable**: Direct mapping to specification requirements\n\nThe checklist format with ✓ marks provides clear pass/fail criteria for each requirement.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED\n\n**Reasoning**: This plan meets all criteria for approval:\n- Crystal clear understanding of requirements with specific citations\n- Logical, well-sequenced 12-step approach\n- Concrete, verifiable evidence (actual JSON file + compliance checklist + technical validation)\n- High confidence appropriately justified with 7 specific reasons\n- No vagueness - all capabilities, criteria, and fields explicitly enumerated\n- Strong evidence quality with multiple validation layers\n\nThe plan will provide solid proof of completion through the deliverable file, specification compliance mapping, and validation checks.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",
