We need to set up a game client from scratch. Given the design docs specify real-time movement, skill bars, and Guild Wars 1-style gameplay, a web-based client using Phaser.js would be ideal. We need to:\n\n1. Create a `client/` directory structure\n2. Set up Phaser.js game framework\n3. Create basic HTML/CSS entry point\n4. Build scenes (boot, login, character select, game world)\n5. Implement player movement first, then combat\n\nDECISION: needs_setup",

The extraction correctly identifies:\n1. Specific numeric values (40px tiles, 200px/s speed, 0,0-2000,2000 bounds)\n2. Faction-specific zone names and aesthetics\n3. Data structures from the TypeScript models\n4. Current client implementation baseline\n5. All relevant interfaces for world/zone management\n\nThe implementation checklist is reasonable and maps to the extracted specifications.\n\nDECISION: plan_approved",
