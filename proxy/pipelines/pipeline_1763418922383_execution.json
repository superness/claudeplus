      "userContext": "The user wants to improve the radial HUD menu interaction by preventing accidental opening. Currently the menu opens too easily when just moving the cursor over the ship. Change it to require a 0.5 second hover before opening - implement a progress-style visual indicator that fills up during the hover to show the user the menu is about to open. This should prevent accidental triggers while still being responsive enough for intentional use.\n\nInputs from previous stages:\n\n[classify_request]:\nLet me analyze this request:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"FEATURE_REQUEST\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.85,\n  \"reasoning\": \"While this involves modifying existing RadialHUD behavior, it requires implementing new functionality: (1) hover timer logic with 0.5s delay, (2) visual progress indicator that fills during hover, and (3) state management for the hover interaction. This goes beyond a simple parameter change (like setting a delay value) - it requires new UI components, animation logic, and interaction state tracking. The request is enhancing the UX with new visual feedback mechanics.\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"originalRequest\": \"Improve radial HUD menu interaction by preventing accidental opening with 0.5s hover delay and progress indicator\",\n    \"keyIndicators\": [\"improve\", \"implement\", \"visual indicator\", \"progress-style\", \"fills up\"],\n    \"affectedArea\": \"RadialHUD UI system (js/ui/RadialHUD.js), potentially new CSS for progress indicator\",\n    \"priority\": \"medium\",\n    \"technicalRequirements\": [\n      \"Add hover timer mechanism (0.5s threshold)\",\n      \"Create visual progress indicator component\",\n      \"Implement fill animation during hover\",\n      \"Update RadialHUD opening logic to respect timer\",\n      \"Handle hover interruption/cancellation\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning Details:**\n\nThis is a **FEATURE_REQUEST** rather than a QUICK_CHANGE because:\n\n1. **New Component Required**: A progress indicator UI element needs to be created (not just modifying existing values)\n2. **Complex Logic**: Timer management, state tracking (hovering vs not hovering), and animation coordination\n3. **Multi-file Changes**: Likely requires changes to `RadialHUD.js` + new/updated CSS for the progress indicator\n4. **UX Enhancement**: This is adding a new user interaction pattern, not just tweaking existing behavior\n\nIf the request was just \"add a 0.5 second delay before the menu opens\" (simple timer), that could be QUICK_CHANGE. But the visual progress indicator requirement elevates this to a feature enhancement.\n\nDECISION: FEATURE_REQUEST\n",

automation to simulate precise mouse movements\n2. **Combine WebSocket commands** with browser DOM inspection for comprehensive validation\n3. **Capture timestamps** at critical points (hover start, 250ms, 500ms, menu open)\n4. **Screenshot capture** at each test phase for visual evidence\n5. **Performance monitoring** using browser Performance API\n6. **Evidence collection** in structured JSON format with all test data\n\n## Example Test Script Structure\n\n```javascript\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nclass HoverDelayTester {\n  constructor() {\n    this.ws = null;\n    this.browser = null;\n    this.evidence = [];\n  }\n\n  async setup() {\n    // Connect WebSocket\n    this.ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8765');\n    \n    // Launch browser\n    this.browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});\n    this.page = await this.browser.newPage();\n    await this.page.goto('http://localhost:8080');\n  }\n\n  async testCase001_NoInstantOpen() {\n    const startTime = Date.now();\n    \n    // Get ship position via WebSocket\n    const shipPos = await this.sendCommand('getShipPosition');\n    \n    // Hover for 200ms using Puppeteer\n    await this.page.mouse.move(shipPos.x, shipPos.y);\n    await this.page.waitForTimeout(200);\n    await this.page.mouse.move(0, 0); // Move away\n    \n    // Check HUD state\n    const hudState = await this.sendCommand('getHUDState');\n    \n    this.evidence.push({\n      testCase: 'TC-001',\n      hoverDuration: 200,\n      menuOpened: hudState.data.radialHUDVisible,\n      expected: false,\n      passed: !hudState.data.radialHUDVisible\n    });\n  }\n\n  async sendCommand(cmd, params = {}) {\n    return new Promise((resolve) => {\n      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({command: cmd, ...params}));\n      this.ws.once('message', (data) => resolve(JSON.parse(data)));\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDECISION: test_plan_ready",

This approach:\n- Minimizes file changes (2 core files modified)\n- Keeps hover logic co-located with menu display logic\n- Avoids unnecessary abstraction for a focused feature\n\n### Key Technical Decisions\n\n1. **Timestamp-based Timing**: Uses `performance.now()` for frame-rate-independent accuracy\n2. **CSS-driven Animation**: Leverages GPU-accelerated CSS transforms for smooth progress fill\n3. **State Machine Pattern**: Clean state transitions (Idle → Hovering → Opening → Open)\n4. **Integrated Testing**: WebSocket commands + Puppeteer automation for comprehensive validation\n\n### Critical Implementation Points\n\n1. **Timer Accuracy**: Must use timestamps, not frame counting\n2. **Progress Indicator**: SVG circular arc with stroke-dashoffset animation\n3. **Reset Behavior**: Complete timer reset on hover interruption (no partial credit)\n4. **Performance**: <0.5ms per frame overhead, no FPS impact\n5. **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicator provides clear user feedback\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- **8 automated test cases** covering timing, visuals, interruption, performance, edge cases\n- **Browser automation** using Puppeteer for precise mouse simulation\n- **WebSocket commands** for state inspection and validation\n- **Evidence capture** with screenshots, timing logs, and JSON reports\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Read existing `RadialHUD.js` to understand current implementation\n2. Implement hover timer state management (steps 2-4)\n3. Add visual progress indicator (steps 5-6)\n4. Integrate with game loop (step 7)\n5. Build testing infrastructure (steps 8-9)\n6. Validate and polish (steps 10-12)\n\n**DECISION: implementation_plan_ready**",

      "prompt": "You are a Game Runner that executes reproduction scripts and captures ALL evidence including Chrome console logs.\n\n# STANDARDIZED CHROME MANAGEMENT\n\n## Use the Standardized Chrome Launch Script\n\nThe codebase provides a standardized Chrome management script that handles:\n- Killing existing Chrome debug instances\n- Launching Chrome with proper debugging flags\n- Waiting for CDP endpoint availability\n- Connecting Puppeteer for console log capture\n\n**Script Location:** `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/launch-chrome-and-capture-logs.sh`\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\n# Launch Chrome and capture console logs\n./launch-chrome-and-capture-logs.sh [GAME_URL] [LOG_FILE]\n\n# Example:\n./launch-chrome-and-capture-logs.sh http://localhost:8080 /tmp/chrome-console.log\n```\n\n**What the script does:**\n1. Kills any existing Chrome instances with debug port (9222)\n2. Launches Chrome via Windows batch file with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`\n3. Waits for CDP endpoint to become available (max 30 seconds)\n4. Connects Puppeteer to capture console logs in real-time\n5. Captures console messages, page errors, and network failures\n6. Writes all logs to specified file\n\n**Integration in Test Scripts:**\nWhen creating reproduction scripts, use this standardized approach:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# reproduction-script.sh\n\n# 1. Setup environment (HTTP server, etc.)\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\nnpx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1 > http.log 2>&1 &\nsleep 3\n\n# 2. Launch Chrome using standardized script (runs in background)\n/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/launch-chrome-and-capture-logs.sh \\\n  http://localhost:8080 \\\n  /tmp/chrome-console-$(date +%s).log &\n\nCHROME_LOGGER_PID=$!\nsleep 5  # Wait for Chrome to fully initialize\n\n# 3. Execute game automation commands via WebSocket\nnode - <<'EOF'\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n// ... WebSocket automation code ...\nEOF\n\n# 4. Wait for test completion\nsleep 10\n\n# 5. Cleanup\nkill $CHROME_LOGGER_PID 2>/dev/null\ntaskkill.exe //F //IM chrome.exe 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n## Why Use the Standardized Script?\n\n1. **Consistent Behavior**: All tests use the same Chrome launch method\n2. **Error Handling**: Script validates CDP endpoint availability\n3. **Clean Startup**: Kills old Chrome instances automatically\n4. **Log Capture**: Puppeteer connection handles all console logging\n5. **Maintainability**: One script to update if Chrome flags change\n\n## Alternative: Manual Chrome Management\n\nIf you need custom Chrome flags or different behavior, you can manage Chrome manually, but you MUST:\n- Kill existing Chrome on port 9222: `taskkill.exe //F //IM chrome.exe`\n- Launch with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`\n- Launch with `--enable-logging` for chrome_debug.log\n- Wait for CDP endpoint: `curl http://localhost:9222/json`\n- Connect Puppeteer to `browserURL: 'http://localhost:9222'`\n\n# CRITICAL: Environment Setup Before Test Execution\n\n## MANDATORY Pre-Execution Checklist\n\nBefore running ANY reproduction script, ALWAYS verify and fix the environment:\n\n### 1. HTTP Server Check\n\n**Problem:** HTTP server must run with `-c-1` flag (no caching) or tests will use old code.\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\n# Check if HTTP server is running with -c-1\nps aux | grep http-server | grep -- '-c-1'\n```\n\n**Fix if not running correctly:**\n```bash\n# Kill old server\nlsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null\n\n# Start with -c-1 flag\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\nnpx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1 > http.log 2>&1 &\n\n# Wait for server to start\nsleep 3\n\n# Verify it's running\ncurl -I http://localhost:8080/ 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -q \"200\"\n```\n\n### 2. Old Chrome Process Cleanup\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\n# Check for Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\"\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\n# Kill any Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -u | xargs -I {} taskkill.exe /F /PID {}\n```\n\n### 3. Working Directory\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\npwd\n# Should be: /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n```\n\n## Environment Setup Script\n\nALWAYS run this before test execution:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"🧹 Cleaning up old processes...\"\n\n# Kill Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -u | xargs -I {} taskkill.exe /F /PID {} 2>/dev/null\n\n# Kill HTTP server on port 8080\nlsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null\n\necho \"✓ Cleanup complete\"\necho \"\"\necho \"🚀 Starting HTTP server with NO CACHING...\"\n\n# Go to game directory\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n\n# Start HTTP server with cache disabled (CRITICAL!)\nnpx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1 > http.log 2>&1 &\n\n# Wait for server to start\nsleep 3\n\n# Verify server is running\nif curl -I http://localhost:8080/ 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -q \"200\"; then\n  echo \"✓ HTTP server running on port 8080\"\nelse\n  echo \"❌ HTTP server failed to start\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"\"\necho \"✅ Environment ready for testing\"\necho \"\"\n```\n\n## CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Your Job\n1. VERIFY environment setup (HTTP server with -c-1, no old Chrome)\n2. ACTUALLY RUN the test script (DO NOT just create files)\n3. Execute with bash commands like `node script.js`\n4. Capture WebSocket command/response data\n5. Capture Chrome console logs\n6. Report only factual observations\n\n## Console Log Verification\n\nAfter running a reproduction script, ALWAYS verify console logs were captured:\n\n```bash\n# Check if evidence file has console logs\ncat bug_evidence_*.json | grep -A 5 \"consoleLogFile\"\n\n# Verify console log file exists\nls -lh /mnt/c/Users/*/AppData/Local/Temp/ChromeTest_*/chrome_debug.log\n\n# Count console entries in evidence\ncat bug_evidence_*.json | jq '.consoleLogs | length'\n```\n\n## Evidence Requirements\n\nEvery evidence file you generate MUST include:\n- `consoleLogFile`: Path to chrome_debug.log\n- `consoleLogs`: Array of parsed console messages\n- `consoleErrorCount`: Number of console errors\n- `consoleExceptionCount`: Number of JavaScript exceptions\n\n## If Console Logs Are Missing\n\nIf the script did NOT capture console logs:\n1. Note this in your output: \"WARNING: Console logs missing from evidence\"\n2. Check if Chrome was launched with `--enable-logging` flag\n3. Check if chrome_debug.log file exists\n4. Report that bug_verifier will return INCONCLUSIVE\n\n## Execution Checklist\n\nBefore reporting completion, verify:\n- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` flag\n- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed\n- ✅ Working directory is /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n- ✅ Script was executed (not just created)\n- ✅ Evidence file was generated\n- ✅ Evidence includes `consoleLogFile` field\n- ✅ Evidence includes `consoleLogs` array\n- ✅ Console log file exists on disk\n- ✅ WebSocket commands were executed\n\n## Output Format\n\nReport execution results objectively:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execution\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"environment\": {\n    \"httpServerRunning\": true,\n    \"httpServerCachingDisabled\": true,\n    \"oldChromeProcessesKilled\": true,\n    \"workingDirectory\": \"/mnt/c/github/superstarships\"\n  },\n  \"evidenceFile\": \"bug_evidence_1763400000000.json\",\n  \"scriptOutput\": \"[stdout from script execution]\",\n  \"commandsExecuted\": 5,\n  \"consoleLogsCaptured\": true,\n  \"consoleLogFile\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\ChromeTest_1763400000000\\\\chrome_debug.log\",\n  \"consoleLogCount\": 47,\n  \"consoleErrorCount\": 2,\n  \"consoleExceptionCount\": 1,\n  \"frameworkError\": false,\n  \"bugReproductionStatus\": \"BUG_REPRODUCED|NOT_REPRODUCED|INCONCLUSIVE\"\n}\n```\n\n## Framework Error Detection\n\nIf environment setup fails or test execution encounters infrastructure issues, report:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execution\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"frameworkError\": true,\n  \"errorDetails\": {\n    \"issue\": \"HTTP server not running with -c-1 flag\",\n    \"expected\": \"HTTP server with cache disabled\",\n    \"actual\": \"HTTP server with default caching\",\n    \"affectedTests\": \"All tests may use old code\"\n  },\n  \"bugReproductionStatus\": \"INCONCLUSIVE\",\n  \"reason\": \"Environment not properly configured for testing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen return `DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR`\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Issue: HTTP server not running with -c-1\n**Symptoms**: Code changes don't take effect, old bugs persist\n**Detection**: `ps aux | grep http-server | grep -- '-c-1'` returns nothing\n**Solution**: Kill server, restart with `-c-1` flag\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: No console logs in evidence\n**Cause**: Script didn't use `--enable-logging` flag\n**Fix**: Update script to include Chrome logging flags\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: chrome_debug.log not found\n**Cause**: Chrome profile directory incorrect\n**Fix**: Verify user-data-dir path is accessible from WSL\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: consoleLogs array empty\n**Cause**: Log parsing regex failed\n**Fix**: Check log file format, update parsing logic\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: Old Chrome processes interfering\n**Symptoms**: WebSocket connection refused, port conflicts\n**Detection**: `netstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\"` shows processes\n**Solution**: Kill processes: `taskkill.exe /F /PID [PID]`\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\nDO NOT just read the script and assume it works. \n\n1. **Setup environment** (HTTP server with -c-1, kill old Chrome)\n2. **EXECUTE the script** \n3. **Verify evidence** contains console logs\n4. **Check for framework errors**\n\nWithout proper environment setup and console logs, the bug verification pipeline will fail.\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with exactly one of these decisions:\n- DECISION: execution_complete (Game executed, behavior observed)\n\nFormat: End with \"DECISION: [YOUR_CHOICE]\" on the last line.",

Progress indicator visible but not animating\n\n**Root Cause:** The hover timer is being started correctly (browser logs show \"Hover timer started - holding for 500 ms\"), but the timer callback that should update `hoverProgress` is either not being called or `hoverProgress` is not being set properly.\n\n### Framework Status\n\n✅ **Test Infrastructure: WORKING**\n- HTTP server properly configured\n- Chrome debugging working\n- Console logs captured successfully\n- Puppeteer automation executed all tests\n- Evidence saved with complete data\n\n❌ **Feature Implementation: BUGS DETECTED**\n- Hover delay mechanism not enforcing 500ms requirement\n- Progress indicator animation not working\n- Timer interruption not canceling menu open\n\n**Decision: execution_complete**\n\nThe test execution successfully captured all evidence needed for bug verification. The feature has critical implementation bugs that prevent the hover delay and progress indicator from working as intended.\n\nDECISION: execution_complete",

Create progress indicator UI element (CSS + HTML)\n2. Implement progress animation using `requestAnimationFrame` or CSS transitions\n3. Update progress from 0→100% during 500ms hover period\n\n### Gap 3: No Timer Reset on Interruption\n**Area:** Hover state management  \n**Reason:** Interrupted hovers still trigger menu opening  \n**Severity:** **HIGH**  \n**Evidence:** TC-004 shows menu opens despite 300ms interruption  \n**Next Step:** Add `mouseleave` event handler to clear hover timer and reset progress\n\n### Gap 4: Missing WebSocket Automation Commands\n**Area:** Test infrastructure  \n**Reason:** Expected commands not implemented in game  \n**Severity:** **MEDIUM** (testing only)  \n**Missing Commands:**\n- `getProgressIndicatorState`\n- `startPerformanceMonitoring`\n- `getPerformanceMetrics`\n- `setTargetFrameRate`\n- `getHoverTiming`\n\n**Next Step:** Add these commands to `TestingBrowserBridge.js` or create dedicated test interface\n\n### Gap 5: No Test Coverage for Edge Cases\n**Area:** Comprehensive testing  \n**Reason:** Only 3 of 8 test cases executed with valid data  \n**Severity:** **MEDIUM**  \n**Evidence:** TC-005, TC-006, TC-007, TC-008 not run or no data collected  \n**Next Step:** Complete test automation script with all scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Primary Issue:** The hover delay feature appears to **not be implemented at all** in the current codebase.\n\n**Evidence Chain:**\n1. Menu opens on 100ms hover (should require 500ms)\n2. Progress indicator always 0% (no animation running)\n3. No timer reset behavior (interruptions don't prevent opening)\n4. Console logs show \"Hover timer started\" messages but behavior doesn't match\n\n**Hypothesis:** The existing code may have hover-related event listeners, but:\n- No actual delay enforcement before showing RadialHUD\n- No progress indicator UI component exists or is connected\n- No state machine to track hover duration and reset on interruption\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Implementation Steps\n\n### Priority 1: Core Delay Logic (Gap 1)\n```javascript\n// In RadialHUD.js or hover handler\nlet hoverTimer = null;\nlet hoverStartTime = 0;\n\nshipElement.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {\n  hoverStartTime = Date.now();\n  hoverTimer = setTimeout(() => {\n    this.showRadialHUD();\n  }, 500);\n});\n\nshipElement.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => {\n  clearTimeout(hoverTimer);\n  hoverTimer = null;\n  this.hideProgressIndicator();\n});\n```\n\n### Priority 2: Progress Indicator (Gap 2)\n```javascript\n// Animation loop during hover\nfunction updateProgress() {\n  const elapsed = Date.now() - hoverStartTime;\n  const progress = Math.min(elapsed / 500, 1.0);\n  progressElement.style.width = `${progress * 100}%`;\n  \n  if (progress < 1.0) {\n    requestAnimationFrame(updateProgress);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Priority 3: Test Infrastructure (Gap 4)\nAdd missing WebSocket commands to testing bridge for automation coverage\n\n---\n\n## Decision Matrix\n\n| Criteria | Status | Weight | Score |\n|----------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Hover delay enforced | ❌ Missing | 30% | 0/30 |\n| Progress indicator visible | ❌ Missing | 25% | 0/25 |\n| Timer reset on interrupt | ❌ Missing | 20% | 0/20 |\n| Performance maintained | ⚠️ Not tested | 10% | 0/10 |\n| Timing accuracy | ⚠️ Partial | 10% | 5/10 |\n| Edge case handling | ❌ Not tested | 5% | 0/5 |\n| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | **5/100** |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe test results show that **the hover delay feature is not implemented** in the current codebase. While the menu eventually opens around the 500ms mark in some tests, it ALSO opens immediately on brief hovers, indicating no actual delay enforcement exists.\n\n**Critical Missing Components:**\n1. ❌ Hover timer that prevents opening before 500ms\n2. ❌ Visual progress indicator UI element\n3. ❌ Progress animation from 0-100%\n4. ❌ Timer reset logic on hover interruption\n\n**Test Infrastructure Gaps:**\n- 5 of 7 required WebSocket commands not implemented\n- Only 3 of 8 test cases produced valid results\n- No performance metrics captured\n\n**Next Immediate Actions:**\n1. Implement hover delay timer in `RadialHUD.js` (js/ui/RadialHUD.js:line_number)\n2. Create progress indicator UI component with CSS animation\n3. Add `mouseleave` handler to reset timer\n4. Re-run full test suite to validate implementation\n\n---\n\n**DECISION: INCOMPLETE**",

Encapsulates timer logic and rendering, reusable for other hover interactions\n2. **Canvas-based rendering** - More performant than CSS animations, integrates cleanly with existing RadialHUD rendering\n3. **Timestamp-based timing** - Frame rate independent, accurate across all devices\n4. **WebSocket test integration** - Comprehensive automated testing via existing browser bridge infrastructure\n5. **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works even if progress indicator fails to render\n\n**Critical Path:**\n1. Create HoverProgressIndicator (Steps 1-2)\n2. Integrate into RadialHUD (Steps 3-5)\n3. Add test automation (Steps 6-7)\n4. Validate and polish (Steps 8-11)\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- Menu opens at 500ms ± 50ms\n- 60 FPS maintained during hover\n- All 8 automated test cases pass\n- No regressions in existing functionality\n\nDECISION: implementation_plan_ready",
