Map each of the 7 stages to their corresponding services with proper configuration\n4. Build the complete JSON structure following the established pipeline format\n5.

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. Clear understanding of the core task: Create a pipeline JSON file with 7 specific stages mapped to their services\n2. Logical approach that starts with reading documentation and existing templates before building\n3. Includes reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.2 for requirements\n4. Plans to examine existing pipeline JSON templates to understand the correct schema\n5. Specifies the exact file path for output: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/share-submission-test.json\n6. Lists all 7 stages with their service mappings correctly\n7. Considers validation and verification steps\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. Evidence collection is somewhat generic - doesn't specify WHAT specific content from section 3.2 will be captured\n2. \"Will verify the JSON is valid\" - doesn't specify HOW this verification will be done (e.g., using a JSON validator, manual inspection, or parsing test)\n3. \"Will ensure all required fields from section 3.2 are included\" - but doesn't specify what those required fields ARE\n4. Confidence level is \"Medium-High\" but this seems appropriate given unknowns about the existing schema\n5. No mention of handling potential errors (e.g., what if section 3.2 doesn't exist, or templates directory is missing)\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nThe plan demonstrates solid understanding of the task structure but lacks specificity in some verification steps. However, the approach is sound: read documentation → examine examples → build following patterns → write output. The evidence steps are adequate to prove task completion.\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**\n\nThe plan specifies concrete evidence that will prove completion:\n- Content from section 3.2 will be shown\n- Example pipeline JSON structure will be displayed\n- Complete generated JSON will be provided before writing\n- File write confirmation will be given\n- Post-write verification that file exists and contains valid JSON\n\nThis provides a clear audit trail from requirements → examples → implementation → verification.\n\n**Verification Path:**\n1. Source documentation (section 3.2) will be visible\n2. Template examples will be visible\n3. Generated JSON will be visible\n4. File write success will be confirmed\n5. File existence and validity will be verified\n\nThis is sufficient to prove the task was completed correctly.\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",

\"Share Submission Test\",         ✅ Descriptive\n  \"description\": \"...\",                    ✅ Present\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",                      ✅ Semantic versioning\n  \"category\": \"testing\",                   ✅ Appropriate\n  \"stages\": [7 stages],                    ✅ All 7 required stages\n  \"flow\": {...},                           ✅ Sequential with conditionals\n  \"metadata\": {...}                        ✅ Complete metadata\n}\n```\n\n### Flow Logic Verification\n- **Flow Type**: Sequential ✅\n- **Total Connections**: 18 flow connections ✅\n- **Error Handling**: All failure paths lead to \"PIPELINE ENDS\" ✅\n- **Decision Coverage**: All stage decisions have corresponding flow connections ✅\n\n**Sample Flow Path (Happy Path)**:\n```\nensure_full_stack_running [stack_running]\n  → set_low_difficulty [difficulty_configured]\n  → monitor_share_submissions [shares_captured]\n  → validate_pool_responses [responses_valid]\n  → analyze_acceptance_rate [acceptance_rate_good]\n  → test_reject_handling [reject_handling_correct]\n  → share_submission_verified [complete]\n  → END\n```\n\n**Error Handling Examples**:\n- `ensure_full_stack_running` → `stack_incomplete` → `null` (PIPELINE ENDS) ✅\n- `monitor_share_submissions` → `no_shares_detected` → `null` (PIPELINE ENDS) ✅\n- `validate_pool_responses` → `responses_invalid` → `null` (PIPELINE ENDS) ✅\n\n### Dependencies & Inputs\nEach stage properly references its predecessor:\n- Stage 2 (`set_low_difficulty`): `\"inputs\": [\"ensure_full_stack_running\"]` ✅\n- Stage 3 (`monitor_share_submissions`): `\"inputs\": [\"set_low_difficulty\"]` ✅\n- Stage 4 (`validate_pool_responses`): `\"inputs\": [\"monitor_share_submissions\"]` ✅\n- Stage 5 (`analyze_acceptance_rate`): `\"inputs\": [\"validate_pool_responses\"]` ✅\n- Stage 6 (`test_reject_handling`): `\"inputs\": [\"analyze_acceptance_rate\"]` ✅\n- Stage 7 (`share_submission_verified`): `\"inputs\": [\"test_reject_handling\"]` ✅\n\n### Metadata Validation\n```json\n{\n  \"tags\": [\"testing\", \"shares\", \"validation\", \"stratum\", \"mining-cycle\"], ✅\n  \"author\": \"Mining Cycle Automation System\", ✅\n  \"estimatedTime\": \"2-5 minutes\", ✅\n  \"requiresWSL\": true, ✅\n  \"basedOn\": \"Section 3.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\", ✅ Explicit attribution\n  \"components\": [\n    \"network_monitor\",\n    \"config_generator\",\n    \"stratum_monitor\",\n    \"share_validator\",\n    \"performance_analyzer\"\n  ], ✅ All 5 agents listed\n  \"testScope\": \"Share submission and pool acceptance validation\", ✅\n  \"prerequisites\": [\n    \"Bitcoin daemon running in regtest mode\",\n    \"CoiniumServ pool server active\",\n    \"Mining software connected to pool\"\n  ] ✅\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## QUALITY_ASSESSMENT: Work Quality & Completeness\n\n### ✅ **Structural Quality**\n1. **JSON Formatting**: Properly indented, well-structured\n2. **Naming Consistency**: Uses kebab-case for IDs consistently\n3. **Stage Types**: Appropriate types (monitor, generator, validator, analyzer)\n4. **Agent Selection**: Correct specialized agents for each task\n\n### ✅ **Functional Completeness**\n1. **All Required Stages**: 7/7 stages implemented\n2. **Agent Assignments**: Match specification exactly\n3. **Flow Logic**: Sequential with proper branching\n4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure paths\n5. **End State**: Clear terminal conditions\n\n### ✅ **Documentation Quality**\n1. **Stage Descriptions**: Clear, actionable descriptions for each stage\n2. **Decision Descriptions**: Each decision choice explained\n3. **Flow Descriptions**: Connection reasons documented\n4. **Metadata**: Complete with prerequisites and scope\n\n### ✅ **Best Practices**\n1. **Explicit Attribution**: `\"basedOn\": \"Section 3.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\"`\n2. **Version Control**: Semantic versioning (1.0.0)\n3. **Categorization**: Properly tagged and categorized\n4. **WSL Awareness**: `\"requiresWSL\": true` flag set\n5. **Estimated Time**: Realistic 2-5 minute estimate\n\n### ✅ **Technical Correctness**\n1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Linear stage progression\n2. **Complete Flow Coverage**: All decision paths covered\n3. **Proper Null Termination**: Failed paths terminate correctly\n4. **Input Chain**: Each stage references correct predecessor\n\n### ✅ **Alignment with Ecosystem**\n- Follows same pattern as existing templates (daemon-pool-integration.json, mining-health-check-v1.json)\n- Uses standard agent names from the agent library\n- Consistent metadata structure with other pipelines\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n**Requirements Met**: 7/7 stages ✅
