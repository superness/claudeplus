This appears to be requesting either: 1) execution of an existing tool/script called \"Meta Pipeline Builder V2\", 2) creation of a meta-level pipeline building system, or 3) construction of a development workflow pipeline from scratch.\n\nAPPROACH: I will first search the codebase to determine if \"Meta Pipeline Builder V2\" is an existing component, script, or configuration. If it exists, I'll examine its structure and requirements. If it doesn't exist, I'll need to understand the project context to design an appropriate development workflow pipeline that fits this codebase (which appears to be CoiniumServ, a cryptocurrency mining pool server based on the git status).\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Search for \"Meta Pipeline Builder\" references in the codebase using Grep tool with pattern \"Meta.*Pipeline.*Builder\" across all file types\n2) Search for \"pipeline\" or \"workflow\" related files using Glob tool with patterns like \"**/pipeline*\", \"**/*workflow*\", \".github/workflows/*\"\n3) Examine the project structure by reading key files: CoiniumServ.sln, README.md, build configuration files\n4) Search for CI/CD configurations (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.)\n5) Read build/configuration files in build/bin/Debug/config/ to understand the project's build process\n6) If Meta Pipeline Builder V2 exists: Read its implementation and configuration files\n7) If it doesn't exist: Analyze the codebase structure to determine what a comprehensive development workflow should include (build, test, deploy stages)\n8) Document the current state and identify what components need to be created or configured\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS: \n- Verify the search results comprehensively cover all possible locations for pipeline definitions\n- Handle the case where \"Meta Pipeline Builder V2\" doesn't exist and needs to be created\n- Consider edge cases like partial implementations or deprecated versions (V1)\n- Test that any pipeline configuration works with the existing .NET/C# project structure\n- Validate against common development workflow requirements (CI/CD, testing, deployment)\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Search results showing whether \"Meta Pipeline Builder V2\" exists in the codebase\n- File listings of any pipeline/workflow configurations found\n- Contents of relevant configuration files\n- Project structure analysis showing build system and dependencies\n- List of existing automation or build scripts\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium - The term \"Meta Pipeline Builder V2\" is not a standard industry tool, so it may be project-specific or may need to be created. Success depends on finding existing implementations or understanding the project's specific requirements for what this pipeline should accomplish.\n\nDECISION: PLAN_APPROVED",
