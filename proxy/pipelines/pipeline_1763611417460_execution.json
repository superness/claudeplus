First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's requirements and context\n2. Examine any existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the expected JSON structure and format\n3. Design the JSON structure based on the stages and transitions provided\n4. Create a comprehensive pipeline definition that includes all 7 stages with proper agent assignments, transitions, and any necessary metadata\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md using Read tool to understand section 3.3 requirements fully\n2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory\n3) Read 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the expected schema/structure\n4) Design the complete pool-feature-development.json structure including:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - All 7 stages with proper configuration:\n     * define_feature (task_planner agent)\n     * plan_implementation (task_planner agent)\n     * implement_feature (task_executor agent)\n     * integration_test (cycle_integration_tester agent)\n     * validate_stratum (stratum_monitor agent)\n     * performance_test (performance_analyzer agent)\n     * feature_validation_complete (END state)\n   - Transitions between stages\n   - Any required inputs/outputs per stage\n   - Error handling paths if present in other pipelines\n5) Validate the JSON structure against examples to ensure consistency\n6) Write the complete pipeline JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Will verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates in the directory\n- Will ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent assignments\n- Will validate that stage transitions follow the specified flow: define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete\n- Will check that the END state is properly configured\n- Will ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted\n- Will verify the file is written to the correct path\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Will show the content of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Will display examples of existing pipeline JSON structures\n- Will provide the complete generated pool-feature-development.json content\n- Will confirm successful file write to the target location\n- Will validate JSON syntax is correct\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task requirements are clearly specified with exact stage names and agent assignments.

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The plan demonstrates clear understanding of the core requirement: creating a pipeline JSON file with 7 specific stages and agent assignments\n2. The approach is methodical and follows good engineering practice: research existing examples first, then design, then implement\n3. The plan explicitly calls out the need to examine section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md for context\n4. All 7 stages are correctly enumerated with their associated agents\n5. The plan includes validation steps against existing templates for consistency\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Evidence collection is incomplete** - The plan states \"Will show content of section 3.3\" and \"Will display examples\" but doesn't commit to capturing these as concrete artifacts that prove the design matches requirements\n2. **No explicit schema validation** - While the plan mentions \"validate JSON syntax,\" it doesn't specify HOW this validation will occur (e.g., using a JSON validator, checking against a schema file if one exists)\n3. **Missing error handling specification** - The plan mentions \"Error handling paths if present in other pipelines\" but doesn't commit to including them or explain what to do if they're not present\n4. **Vague transition specification** - The plan lists the stage flow but doesn't detail what the transition structure should look like (e.g., conditional transitions, automatic transitions, required inputs/outputs per transition)\n5. **Confidence justification is weak** - \"Medium-High\" confidence with caveats about needing to see documentation suggests uncertainty about the structure\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- The plan doesn't specify capturing a diff or comparison between the generated JSON and existing templates as evidence\n- No mention of verifying that agent names (task_planner, task_executor, etc.) match actual available agents in the system\n- The phrase \"Will verify the JSON structure matches\" is passive - who/what will verify? What specific checks?\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**\n\nThe proposed evidence is mostly descriptive (\"will show\", \"will display\") rather than concrete and verifiable. Strong evidence would include:\n- Exact JSON schema compliance proof\n- Side-by-side comparison with reference pipeline\n- Automated validation output\n- Confirmation that all agent names exist in the system\n- Hash or checksum of the final file\n\nThe plan doesn't commit to providing these concrete proofs of correctness.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Reasoning:** While the plan shows understanding of the basic requirements, it lacks the rigor needed for a production pipeline configuration. The evidence collection strategy is insufficient to prove the pipeline will actually work in the system. The plan should specify:\n1. Explicit schema validation steps with output capture\n2. Verification that agent names are valid (not just assumed)\n3. Concrete comparison methodology with existing templates\n4. Clear success criteria for each validation step\n5. Higher confidence with better justification, or explicit acknowledgment of unknowns that need discovery\n\nThe medium-high confidence with significant caveats suggests the planner isn't certain about critical structural details, which is a red flag for a configuration file that could break a development workflow if incorrect.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

This pipeline will automate the development and validation of new CoiniumServ features with mining cycle testing through 7 defined stages.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications\n2. Analyze the required pipeline structure and stage configurations\n3. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON schema\n4. Design the JSON structure with all 7 stages and their transitions\n5. Map each stage to its appropriate agent/component (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer)\n6. Define the complete pipeline configuration with proper stage ordering and validation points\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 3.3\n2. Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline templates: \"templates/*.json\" in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/\n3. Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure\n4. Design the pipeline JSON structure with:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages with their properties\n   - Transition rules between stages (define_feature → task_planner → plan_implementation, etc.)\n   - Agent/component mappings for each stage\n   - Input/output parameters for each stage\n   - Validation criteria and success conditions\n5. Plan the specific configuration for each stage:\n   - define_feature: Initial feature specification stage\n   - plan_implementation: Implementation planning with task_planner\n   - implement_feature: Code implementation with task_executor\n   - integration_test: Mining cycle integration testing\n   - validate_stratum: Stratum protocol validation\n   - performance_test: Performance analysis\n   - feature_validation_complete: Terminal success stage\n6. Verify the output path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists using Bash ls command\n7. Document the JSON structure that will be written to pool-feature-development.json\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Verify section 3.3 exists and contains pool-feature-development pipeline specifications\n- Check if the templates directory exists and is writable\n- Ensure the JSON schema matches existing pipeline templates for consistency\n- Validate that all 7 stages are properly defined with correct transitions\n- Confirm agent mappings (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer) are correctly assigned\n- Verify the pipeline flow: define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Contents of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- List of existing pipeline templates and their structure\n- Sample pipeline JSON schema from existing templates\n- Verification that /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory exists\n- Complete JSON structure for pool-feature-development.json with all 7 stages properly configured\n- Stage transition mapping showing the complete flow from define_feature to END\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires reading the specification document to understand exact requirements for section 3.3, examining existing pipeline structures for schema consistency, and creating a properly structured JSON configuration.

Error handling? Retry logic? Input/output schemas?\n4. **No verification step**: Missing a concrete validation step after writing the file (e.g., reading it back, JSON parsing test, or comparing against spec requirements)\n5. **Assumption risk**: Assumes section 3.3 will have sufficient detail, but no fallback if the section is incomplete or missing\n6. **Medium-High confidence insufficient**: The confidence rating acknowledges uncertainty about section 3.3 content, which is concerning for a task requiring exact implementation\n\n**Specific Evidence Quality Issues:**\n- \"Contents of section 3.3\" - too vague, what specifically needs to be extracted?\n- \"Complete JSON structure\" - what makes it complete?

This pipeline orchestrates the development and validation of new CoiniumServ mining pool features through 7 stages, each delegating to specific agent types (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer).\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's specifications for the pool-feature-development pipeline\n2. Analyze the stage flow and requirements for each stage\n3. Determine the proper JSON structure based on existing pipeline templates in the claudeplus/templates directory\n4. Design the complete pipeline JSON with all 7 stages, including proper agent routing, input/output parameters, and stage transitions\n5. Specify the file write location as /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract section 3.3 specifications using: `Read` tool with file path to find the document\n2. Search for existing pipeline JSON templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ using: `Glob` tool with pattern \"*.json\" to understand the expected JSON schema\n3. Read 1-2 example pipeline files using: `Read` tool to understand the structure, required fields, and formatting conventions\n4. Design the JSON structure including:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages (define_feature, plan_implementation, implement_feature, integration_test, validate_stratum, performance_test, feature_validation_complete)\n   - Agent type mappings (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer)\n   - Input/output parameters for each stage\n   - Transition rules between stages\n   - Error handling and validation criteria\n5. Format the complete JSON with proper indentation and validation\n6. Write the final JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json using: `Write` tool\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Verify the pipeline JSON follows the same schema/structure as existing pipeline templates\n- Ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent type assignments\n- Validate that stage transitions flow correctly from define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END\n- Confirm each stage has appropriate input/output parameter definitions for data flow between stages\n- Check that CoiniumServ-specific requirements (mining cycle validation, stratum protocol, performance metrics) are properly captured\n- Ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3 showing the pipeline requirements\n- Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected schema and structure\n- The complete generated pool-feature-development.json file with all stages properly configured\n- Verification that the file is written to the correct location: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a structured JSON creation task based on documented specifications. The main uncertainty is whether MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and contains section 3.3, and what the exact schema requirements are from existing pipeline templates. Once these documents are read, the task becomes straightforward JSON authoring following established patterns.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a methodical approach to creating a pipeline configuration file, but has several critical weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. Logical sequence: Read documentation → Study existing templates → Generate new pipeline → Write file\n2. Recognizes need to understand existing schema before creating new file\n3. Identifies the 7 stages and agent type mappings clearly\n4. Plans to validate JSON structure against existing templates\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n1. **Assumption Risk**: The plan assumes MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and contains section 3.3 without first verifying this. The confidence level acknowledges this (\"main uncertainty is whether MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists\") but doesn't include a contingency step\n2. **Vague Evidence Collection**: While it mentions \"Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3\" as evidence, it doesn't specify HOW to verify the pipeline matches the specification (e.g., checklist of required elements, validation criteria)\n3. **Missing Verification Steps**: No plan to validate the generated JSON after writing (e.g., JSON syntax validation, schema compliance check, or comparison with source requirements)\n4. **Incomplete Test Considerations**: The test considerations are good but aren't integrated into the actual execution steps - they're just listed as things to \"verify\" without specifying when/how\n5. **No Concrete Success Criteria**: What specific elements from section 3.3 must be present? What makes the pipeline \"correct\" beyond just having 7 stages?\n\n**Medium Confidence Issues:**\n- The plan acknowledges uncertainty but rates confidence as \"Medium-High\" - this seems contradictory\n- \"Once these documents are read, the task becomes straightforward\" is overconfident without knowing the complexity of the specification\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe proposed evidence lacks specificity:\n- \"Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3\" - What specific elements must be captured?\n- \"Example pipeline JSON files showing expected schema\" - How will compliance be verified?\n- \"The complete generated pool-feature-development.json file\" - This is output, not proof of correctness\n- No evidence of validation against the source specification after creation\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific reasons:**\n1. Missing verification that source document exists before proceeding\n2. No concrete validation steps to prove the generated pipeline matches section 3.3 requirements\n3. Evidence collection is too vague - lists outputs rather than verification criteria\n4. Lacks post-creation validation steps to prove correctness\n5. Test considerations should be actionable steps, not just a list of things to think about\n\n**Required improvements:**\n- Add explicit step to verify MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and locate section 3.3\n- Define specific checklist of required elements from section 3.3 that must be present\n- Include validation step after writing (JSON syntax check, comparison with spec)\n- Lower confidence rating to match acknowledged uncertainties\n- Specify concrete success criteria beyond \"file written to correct location\"\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The plan demonstrates clear understanding of the task: create a pipeline JSON file with 7 specific stages routing to 5 different agent types\n2. Logical step-by-step approach: read specification → examine existing templates → understand schema → design new pipeline\n3. All 7 stages are explicitly identified with their routing targets\n4. The approach correctly prioritizes understanding existing patterns before creating new content\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Missing File Write Step**: The plan describes designing the JSON structure but never explicitly states it will WRITE the file to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`. Step 6 says \"Specify the exact JSON structure\" but doesn't say \"Write the JSON to the target path.\" This is a fundamental omission.\n\n2. **Vague Evidence Collection**: \n   - \"Will provide contents of section 3.3\" - but doesn't specify HOW this proves task completion\n   - \"Complete designed JSON schema\" - where? In memory? Written to file?\n   - No mention of verifying the file exists at the target path after creation\n\n3. **No Concrete Verification Plan**: The plan should explicitly state:\n   - \"Read the created file from `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`\"\n   - \"Verify it contains all 7 stages with correct routing\"\n   - \"Validate JSON syntax is correct\"\n   - \"Confirm file permissions and location\"\n\n4. **Confidence Justification Mismatch**: \"Medium-High\" confidence seems appropriate for the design phase, but there's no acknowledgment that the actual file creation step might have issues (directory permissions, JSON formatting errors, etc.)\n\n5. **Incomplete TEST_CONSIDERATIONS**: Lists what the pipeline should handle (sequential progression, routing, error handling) but doesn't explain how the PLAN will verify these aspects work correctly\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**\n\nThe proposed evidence is conceptual rather than concrete:\n- \"Contents of section 3.3\" - informational, not proof of completion\n- \"Example pipeline JSON structure\" - reference material, not deliverable\n- \"Complete designed JSON schema showing all 7 stages\" - design artifact, but no proof it was written to the correct file path\n- \"Verification that stage names... match requirements\" - mentions verification but doesn't specify the verification METHOD\n\n**What's missing for STRONG evidence:**\n- File system proof: Successful read of `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`\n- Content proof: Display of the actual JSON showing all 7 stages\n- Validation proof: Confirmation that JSON is valid and matches the specification\n- Location proof: Verification the file exists at the exact requested path\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasoning**: \nWhile the plan shows good understanding of the pipeline requirements and a logical approach to gathering information, it fails the fundamental requirement of providing concrete, verifiable proof of task completion. The plan describes \"designing\" but never explicitly commits to \"writing the file to the target path\" and \"verifying it exists.\" A complete plan must include:\n1. Explicit file write step with exact path\n2. Post-write verification (read the file back)\n3. Content validation against requirements\n4. Concrete evidence that can be independently verified\n\nThe plan needs revision to add these critical verification steps.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The plan correctly identifies the need to read section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md as the primary specification source\n- Shows good understanding that examining existing pipeline JSON files is essential to match the schema\n- Has a logical flow: read spec → examine examples → understand schema → map stages → create structure\n- Identifies the 7 stages clearly with their agent assignments\n- Mentions validation checks for JSON syntax and schema compliance\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Missing File Existence Verification**: The plan doesn't verify that /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory actually exists before planning to write there. This is a critical oversight.\n\n2. **Insufficient Evidence Specification**: While the plan mentions \"will collect and reference\" various items, it doesn't specify HOW completion will be verified. What exact checks will prove the pipeline JSON is:\n   - Functional and loadable by the automation system?\n   - Compatible with the agents it references (task_planner, task_executor, etc.)?\n   - Contains all required fields for pipeline execution?\n\n3. **Vague Schema Understanding**: The plan lists \"fields like name, description, stages, agent assignments, transitions, etc.\" - this is too vague. Without knowing the EXACT schema, how can we be confident the implementation will be correct?\n\n4. **No Validation of Agent References**: The plan doesn't mention verifying that the referenced agents (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer) actually exist in the system or are properly configured.\n\n5. **Medium Confidence is Concerning**: The plan itself acknowledges medium confidence, which suggests insufficient information gathering before committing to implementation.\n\n6. **No Post-Creation Verification**: There's no step to validate the created JSON works (e.g., syntax validation, schema validation against a known validator, or dry-run test).\n\n**Missing Evidence:**\n- No plan to verify the output file was written successfully to the correct location\n- No specification of what \"proper stage ordering\" means - is there a dependency graph to validate?\n- No mention of verifying that section 3.3 actually exists and contains the needed information\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak\n\nThe proposed evidence is mostly about information gathering (reading docs, examining examples) but lacks concrete COMPLETION PROOF:\n- \"The exact content of section 3.3\" - just reading it isn't evidence of correct implementation\n- \"Examples of existing pipeline JSON structures\" - examining examples isn't proof the new file works\n- \"The complete JSON schema specification\" - understanding the schema isn't evidence the file was created correctly\n- \"A mapping table\" - planning isn't evidence of execution\n- \"The final planned JSON structure\" - a plan isn't a completed artifact\n\n**What's Missing:**\n- A verification step that reads back the created file and validates it against the schema\n- Confirmation that all 7 stages are present with correct agent assignments\n- Proof that the file is syntactically valid JSON (e.g., running it through a JSON parser)\n- Validation that required fields from section 3.3 are all present in the output\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasoning:**\nThis plan is a research and information-gathering plan, not an implementation plan with verifiable completion criteria. Before approving, the plan must:\n\n1. Add explicit verification that /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/ and the templates/ subdirectory exist\n2. Define CONCRETE completion evidence:\n   - \"Read back the created JSON file and parse it successfully\"\n   - \"Verify all 7 stages appear in the output with correct agent assignments\"\n   - \"Confirm file size > 0 and proper JSON syntax\"\n   - \"Cross-reference created fields against schema requirements documented from examples\"\n3. Include a validation step after file creation\n4. Specify what happens if section 3.3 doesn't exist or lacks critical information\n5. Address the medium confidence issue - either gather more information to raise confidence, or acknowledge specific risks\n\nThe plan shows good thinking but needs a clear \"definition of done\" with measurable, verifiable completion criteria.\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

The pipeline should have 7 stages for developing CoiniumServ features with mining cycle validation, and should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's requirements and context\n2. Analyze the pipeline stages and their connections to understand the workflow\n3. Determine the correct JSON structure based on any existing pipeline templates in the claudeplus/templates directory\n4. Design the JSON schema with proper stage definitions, transitions, and agent assignments\n5. Plan the file write operation to the specified location\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Use Glob tool to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository (pattern: \"**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\")\n2) Use Read tool to read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file, specifically focusing on section 3.3\n3) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ (pattern: \"*.json\")\n4) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline templates to understand the JSON structure/schema\n5) Design the JSON structure with:\n   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)\n   - 7 stages as specified: define_feature, plan_implementation, implement_feature, integration_test, validate_stratum, performance_test, feature_validation_complete\n   - Agent assignments: task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer\n   - Transitions between stages\n   - Any required configuration parameters per stage\n6) Use Bash tool to verify the target directory exists: ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/\n7) Plan to use Write tool to write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Verify the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and section 3.3 is accessible\n- Ensure the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates for consistency\n- Validate that all 7 stages are correctly defined with proper agent assignments\n- Confirm the stage transitions flow correctly (define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END)\n- Check that the target directory /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists before writing\n- Ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted\n- Verify all agent types mentioned (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer) are correctly assigned\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Contents of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md\n- Example JSON structure from existing pipeline templates\n- Directory listing showing /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists\n- The complete designed JSON structure for pool-feature-development.json\n- Confirmation that all 7 stages and their transitions match the specification\n- Mapping of each stage to its designated agent\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task is straightforward (create a JSON file with specified stages), but confidence depends on finding and understanding section 3.3 of the plan document and matching the existing pipeline JSON schema.

The plan mentions \"Medium-High\" confidence, citing potential issues if section 3.3 or templates are missing. However, this is appropriate hedging - the plan includes fallback considerations\n2. The plan could be slightly more explicit about what to do if section 3.3 doesn't exist or contradicts the user's specification, but the user has provided explicit stage information as a safety net\n\n**Concrete Proof of Completion:**\nThe plan will provide:\n- The actual JSON file created at the specified path\n- Verification that all stages match the specification\n- Confirmation of proper agent assignments\n- Evidence that the structure matches existing pipeline patterns\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong\n\nThe proposed evidence collection is comprehensive and verifiable.
