Review the ship movement/physics code, identify where throttle changes are handled, and implement smooth acceleration and deceleration so ships gradually ramp up to target speed when throttle increases and gradually slow down when throttle decreases. The movement should feel realistic with momentum rather than instant speed changes.",
