Review the ship movement and throttle control code, identify where velocity changes are being applied instantly, and implement proper acceleration/deceleration mechanics so ships smoothly ramp up to target speed and smoothly slow down when throttle is reduced. The change should feel natural and give the player better control over ship momentum.",
