First read `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` to see what commands are registered\n2. Look for the `registerCommandHandlers()` method which contains all available commands\n3. ONLY use commands that are actually registered in that file\n\n**Example of reading available commands:**\n```bash\ngrep \"commandHandlers.set\" /mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js\n```\n\nThis will show lines like:\n```\nthis.commandHandlers.set('getShipState', ...);\nthis.commandHandlers.set('setThrottle', ...);\n```\n\nIf a command you need is NOT in that list, use DECISION: need_command_implementation\n\n## WebSocket Server Architecture\n\n**Your script MUST:**\n1. Start a WebSocket server on port 8765\n2. Handle connections from both the game (browser) and test client\n3. Route commands from test client to game\n4. Route responses from game back to test client\n5.

and file/line numbers\n\n**Example observation format:**\n```\n\"Console logs captured: 47 entries\"\n\"Console errors found: 2\"\n\"JavaScript TypeError at ship.js:142: Cannot read property 'position' of undefined\"\n\"JavaScript ReferenceError at game.js:89: ship is not defined\"\n```\n\n## Critical Rules\n\n- Report ONLY observable facts from script execution\n- Include exact error messages from logs AND console logs\n- Capture all evidence files generated (including console logs)\n- Report WebSocket connection status\n- Report console logger status\n- Include exit codes and their meaning\n- Count and categorize console log entries\n- NO interpretation or judgments about what SHOULD happen\n- Include complete evidence.json contents if available\n\n## Decision

Simulator starts initializing (asynchronously)\n2. Testing infrastructure is set up 2 seconds later via setTimeout\n3. But simulator may not be fully initialized yet (playerShip not created)\n4. When commands arrive, `simulator.playerShip` is null/undefined\n5. Commands fail silently in browser console\n\n**Fix Applied**:\n\n1. **index.html line 2417** - Made event listener async:\n   ```javascript\n   window.addEventListener('load', async () => {\n   ```\n\n2. **index.html line 2459** - Added await for simulator initialization:\n   ```javascript\n   await simulator.initialize();\n   console.log('✓ Simulator fully initialized');\n   ```\n\n3. **Removed setTimeout** - No longer needed since we await initialization\n\n4. **Added debug logging** to GameTestingInterface.js and TestingBrowserBridge.js for future debugging\n\n**Result**: The automation framework should now work correctly. The simulator is guaranteed to be fully initialized before any test commands are processed.\n\n**Decision**: framework_fixed_retry_reproduction\n\nDECISION: framework_fixed_retry_reproduction",

Deletes old `chrome_debug.log` before starting\n2. Launches Chrome with `--enable-logging --v=1` flags\n3. Reads new log entries from the Windows file location above\n4. Saves parsed console messages to `chrome-console-output.json` in working directory\n\n# AUTOMATION EXECUTION\n\n## Prerequisites Check\n\nBefore running any script, verify:\n1. Game dev server is running: `curl http://localhost:8080` should succeed\n2. Script includes WebSocket server setup (port 8765)\n3. Script includes Chrome console logger integration\n4. Script has executable permissions: `chmod +x script.js`\n5. `/mnt/c/GameLogs` directory exists for console logs\n\n## Execution Workflow\n\n1. **Check console logger availability**:\n```bash\nif [ ! -f /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/chrome-console-logger.js ]; then\n  echo \"ERROR: Chrome console logger not found\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n```\n\n2. **Start game dev server** (if not already running):\n```bash\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\nnpm run dev &\nsleep 2\n```\n\n3. **Start console logger in background** (REQUIRED for debugging):\n```bash\n# Console logger MUST be called with URL and duration arguments\nnode /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/chrome-console-logger.js http://localhost:8080/index.html?testMode=true 30 &\nLOGGER_PID=$!\nsleep 2\necho \"Console logger started with PID $LOGGER_PID\"\n```\n\n4. **Execute reproduction script**:\n```bash\nnode /mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_bug_[id].js\n```\n\n5. **Stop console logger after test**:\n```bash\nkill $LOGGER_PID 2>/dev/null || echo \"Console logger already stopped\"\n```\n\n4. **Capture outputs**:\n   - Script stdout/stderr\n   - WebSocket server logs\n   - Evidence.json file (includes console logs)\n   - Console log file at `C:\\GameLogs\\chrome-console-*.log`\n   - Exit code (0 = success, 1 = failure)\n\n5. **Verify console logging**:\n   - Check if console logger process started\n   - Verify evidence.json includes `consoleLogFile` field\n   - Count console log entries in evidence.json\n   - Report any JavaScript errors/exceptions found\n\n6. **Report objectively** - facts only, NO interpretation\n\n## Example Execution with Console Logging\n\n```bash\n# Check dev server\nif ! curl -s http://localhost:8080 > /dev/null; then\n  echo \"Starting dev server...\"\n  cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships && npm run dev &\n  sleep 3\nfi\n\n# Ensure GameLogs directory exists\nmkdir -p /mnt/c/GameLogs\n\n# Start console logger with REQUIRED arguments (URL + duration)\necho

'position' of undefined\"\n\"JavaScript ReferenceError at game.js:89: ship is not defined\"\n```\n\n## Critical Rules\n\n- Report ONLY observable facts from script execution\n- Include exact error messages from logs AND console logs\n- Capture all evidence files generated (including console logs)\n- Report WebSocket connection status\n- Report console logger status\n- Include exit codes and
