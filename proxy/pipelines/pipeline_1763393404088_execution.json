      "userContext": "BUG FIX REQUIRED: The player ship is not responding to movement controls. The ship has a throttle control that the player can adjust, but changing the throttle value does not affect the ship's speed - the ship remains stationary. Additionally, the ship's orientation does not change when it should. Investigate the ship movement system, identify why throttle changes aren't being applied to ship velocity, diagnose the orientation update issue, implement fixes for both problems, and verify that the ship can now move and rotate properly in response to player input.",
