      "userContext": "The user reports that ships instantly jump to their throttle speed instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually. This is a physics/movement issue that needs to be fixed. Review the ship movement/physics code, identify where throttle changes are handled, and implement smooth acceleration and deceleration so ships gradually ramp up to target speed when throttle increases and gradually slow down when throttle decreases. The movement should feel realistic with momentum rather than instant speed changes.\n\nInputs from previous stages:\n\n[classify_request]:\nI'll analyze this request to classify it properly.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**User Request**: Ships instantly jump to their throttle speed instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually. Need smooth acceleration/deceleration with realistic momentum.\n\n**Key Indicators**:\n- \"instantly jump\" - indicates incorrect behavior\n- \"instead of\" - shows expected vs actual behavior mismatch\n- \"needs to be fixed\" - explicit bug language\n- Problem: Current behavior is wrong (instant speed changes)\n- Expected: Gradual acceleration/deceleration with momentum\n\n**Classification Reasoning**:\n\nThis is clearly a **BUG_FIX** because:\n\n1. **Something is broken**: The physics system is not working as intended - ships are teleporting to target speeds instead of accelerating smoothly\n2. **Core functionality issue**: Movement/physics is fundamental game behavior that's malfunctioning\n3. **Behavior correction needed**: The current implementation doesn't match the expected EVE-style physics described in CLAUDE.md\n4. **Not a new feature**: Smooth acceleration should already exist (the codebase has `EVEPhysics.js` and `ShipPhysics.js` with exponential acceleration curves documented)\n5. **Keywords present**: \"issue\", \"needs to be fixed\", describes broken behavior\n\nThis is NOT:\n- **QUICK_CHANGE**: Requires investigation and likely multi-line physics logic fixes\n- **FEATURE_REQUEST**: Smooth acceleration should already be implemented per the architecture docs\n- **REFACTOR**: This is fixing broken behavior, not improving working code\n- **QUESTION**: User is reporting a problem, not asking for information\n\n```json\n{\n  \"classification\": \"BUG_FIX\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.98,\n  \"reasoning\": \"User reports that ship movement physics is broken - ships instantly jump to throttle speed instead of smoothly accelerating/decelerating.

Without console logs, verification will be INCONCLUSIVE.\n\n## Why Console Logs Matter\n\nMany bugs are ONLY visible in console logs, not WebSocket responses:\n- JavaScript exceptions and errors\n- TypeError stack traces  \n- Unexpected warnings during game execution\n- Browser-level errors that don't surface in WebSocket API\n\n## How to Capture Console Logs\n\nUse Chrome's built-in `--enable-logging` flag:\n\n```javascript\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst username = process.env.USER || 'User';\nconst timestamp = Date.now();\nconst profileDir = `C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\${username}\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\ChromeTest_${timestamp}`;\nconst chromeLogPath = `/mnt/c/Users/${username}/AppData/Local/Temp/ChromeTest_${timestamp}/chrome_debug.log`;\n\nspawn('cmd.exe', [\n  '/c', 'start', 'chrome',\n  '--enable-logging',\n  '--v=1', \n  `--user-data-dir=${profileDir}`,\n  `--app=${gameUrl}`\n], {detached: true, stdio: 'ignore'});\n```\n\n# GAME WEBSOCKET AUTOMATION\n\n## Overview\nThe game at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/index.html` connects to a WebSocket automation server that your reproduction scripts must provide.\n\n## CRITICAL: Discovering Available Commands\n\n**BEFORE creating any reproduction script, you MUST:**\n\n1. First read `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` to see what commands are registered\n2. Look for the `registerCommandHandlers()` method which contains all available commands\n3. ONLY use commands that are actually registered in that file\n\n**Example of reading available commands:**\n```bash\ngrep \"commandHandlers.set\" /mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js\n```\n\nThis will show lines like:\n```\nthis.commandHandlers.set('getShipState', ...);\nthis.commandHandlers.set('setThrottle',

HTTP Server Check\n\n**Problem:** HTTP server must run with `-c-1` flag (no caching) or tests will use old code.\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\n# Check if HTTP server is running with -c-1\nps aux | grep http-server | grep -- '-c-1'\n```\n\n**Fix if not running correctly:**\n```bash\n# Kill old server\nlsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null\n\n# Start with -c-1 flag\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\nnpx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1 > http.log 2>&1 &\n\n# Wait for server to start\nsleep 3\n\n# Verify it's running\ncurl -I http://localhost:8080/ 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -q \"200\"\n```\n\n### 2. Old Chrome Process Cleanup\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\n# Check for Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\"\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\n# Kill any Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -u | xargs -I {} taskkill.exe /F /PID {}\n```\n\n### 3. Working Directory\n\n**Check:**\n```bash\npwd\n# Should be: /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n```\n\n## Environment Setup Script\n\nALWAYS run this before test execution:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"🧹 Cleaning up old processes...\"\n\n# Kill Chrome on test ports\nnetstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -u | xargs -I {} taskkill.exe /F /PID {} 2>/dev/null\n\n# Kill HTTP server on port 8080\nlsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null\n\necho \"✓ Cleanup complete\"\necho \"\"\necho \"🚀 Starting HTTP server with NO CACHING...\"\n\n# Go to game directory\ncd /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n\n# Start HTTP server with cache disabled (CRITICAL!)\nnpx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1 > http.log 2>&1 &\n\n# Wait for server to start\nsleep 3\n\n# Verify server is running\nif curl -I http://localhost:8080/ 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -q \"200\"; then\n  echo \"✓ HTTP server running on port 8080\"\nelse\n  echo \"❌ HTTP server failed to start\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"\"\necho \"✅ Environment ready for testing\"\necho \"\"\n```\n\n## CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Your Job\n1. VERIFY environment setup (HTTP server with -c-1, no old Chrome)\n2. ACTUALLY RUN the test script (DO NOT just create files)\n3. Execute with bash commands like `node script.js`\n4. Capture WebSocket command/response data\n5. Capture Chrome console logs\n6. Report only factual observations\n\n## Console Log Verification\n\nAfter running a reproduction script, ALWAYS verify console logs were captured:\n\n```bash\n# Check if evidence file has console logs\ncat bug_evidence_*.json | grep -A 5 \"consoleLogFile\"\n\n# Verify console log file exists\nls -lh /mnt/c/Users/*/AppData/Local/Temp/ChromeTest_*/chrome_debug.log\n\n# Count console entries in evidence\ncat bug_evidence_*.json | jq '.consoleLogs | length'\n```\n\n## Evidence Requirements\n\nEvery evidence file you generate MUST include:\n- `consoleLogFile`: Path to chrome_debug.log\n- `consoleLogs`: Array of parsed console messages\n- `consoleErrorCount`: Number of console errors\n- `consoleExceptionCount`: Number of JavaScript exceptions\n\n## If Console Logs Are Missing\n\nIf the script did NOT capture console logs:\n1. Note this in your output: \"WARNING: Console logs missing from evidence\"\n2. Check if Chrome was launched with `--enable-logging` flag\n3. Check if chrome_debug.log file exists\n4. Report that bug_verifier will return INCONCLUSIVE\n\n## Execution Checklist\n\nBefore reporting completion, verify:\n- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` flag\n- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed\n- ✅ Working directory is /mnt/c/github/superstarships\n- ✅ Script was executed (not just created)\n- ✅ Evidence file was generated\n- ✅ Evidence includes `consoleLogFile` field\n- ✅ Evidence includes `consoleLogs` array\n- ✅ Console log file exists on disk\n- ✅ WebSocket commands were executed\n\n## Output Format\n\nReport execution results objectively:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execution\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"environment\": {\n    \"httpServerRunning\": true,\n    \"httpServerCachingDisabled\": true,\n    \"oldChromeProcessesKilled\": true,\n    \"workingDirectory\": \"/mnt/c/github/superstarships\"\n  },\n  \"evidenceFile\": \"bug_evidence_1763400000000.json\",\n  \"scriptOutput\": \"[stdout from script execution]\",\n  \"commandsExecuted\": 5,\n  \"consoleLogsCaptured\": true,\n  \"consoleLogFile\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\ChromeTest_1763400000000\\\\chrome_debug.log\",\n  \"consoleLogCount\": 47,\n  \"consoleErrorCount\": 2,\n  \"consoleExceptionCount\": 1,\n  \"frameworkError\": false,\n  \"bugReproductionStatus\": \"BUG_REPRODUCED|NOT_REPRODUCED|INCONCLUSIVE\"\n}\n```\n\n## Framework Error Detection\n\nIf environment setup fails or test execution encounters infrastructure issues, report:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execution\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"frameworkError\": true,\n  \"errorDetails\": {\n    \"issue\": \"HTTP server not running with -c-1 flag\",\n    \"expected\": \"HTTP server with cache disabled\",\n    \"actual\": \"HTTP server with default caching\",\n    \"affectedTests\": \"All tests may use old code\"\n  },\n  \"bugReproductionStatus\": \"INCONCLUSIVE\",\n  \"reason\": \"Environment not properly configured for testing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen return `DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR`\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Issue: HTTP server not running with -c-1\n**Symptoms**: Code changes don't take effect, old bugs persist\n**Detection**: `ps aux | grep http-server | grep -- '-c-1'` returns nothing\n**Solution**: Kill server, restart with `-c-1` flag\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: No console logs in evidence\n**Cause**: Script didn't use `--enable-logging` flag\n**Fix**: Update script to include Chrome logging flags\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: chrome_debug.log not found\n**Cause**: Chrome profile directory incorrect\n**Fix**: Verify user-data-dir path is accessible from WSL\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: consoleLogs array empty\n**Cause**: Log parsing regex failed\n**Fix**: Check log file format, update parsing logic\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n### Issue: Old Chrome processes interfering\n**Symptoms**: WebSocket connection refused, port conflicts\n**Detection**: `netstat.exe -ano | findstr.exe \":9222\"` shows processes\n**Solution**: Kill processes: `taskkill.exe /F /PID [PID]`\n**Decision**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\nDO NOT just read the script and assume it works. \n\n1. **Setup environment** (HTTP server with -c-1, kill old Chrome)\n2. **EXECUTE the script** \n3. **Verify evidence** contains console logs\n4. **Check for framework errors**\n\nWithout proper environment setup and console logs, the bug verification pipeline will fail.\n\nIMPORTANT: End your response with exactly one of these decisions:\n- DECISION: execution_complete (Reproduction test executed, evidence collected)\n- DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR (Test infrastructure failure detected)\n\nFormat: End with \"DECISION: [YOUR_CHOICE]\" on the last line.",
