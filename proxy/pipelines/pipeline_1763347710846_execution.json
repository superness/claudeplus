This is a high-priority blocking issue that prevents core gameplay. \n\nRequired actions:\n1. Investigate the ship movement code to identify why navigation commands are not being processed\n2. Check tap-to-move input handling and verify events are being triggered\n3. Examine the navigation target system and movement execution logic\n4. Identify the root cause of the movement failure\n5. Fix the bug to restore ship movement functionality\n6. Test thoroughly to confirm the ship now responds correctly to both navigation targets and tap-to-move commands",
