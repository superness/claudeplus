This agent will establish and validate the RPC connection between the daemon and pool, including configuration, testing, authentication validation, network verification, and monitoring.\n\nAPPROACH: \n1. Read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 requirements\n2. Examine existing agent patterns in the /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ directory\n3. Design the agent JSON structure with appropriate permissions, decisions, and workflow\n4. Create configuration for daemon RPC connection establishment\n5. Define validation steps for connectivity, authentication, and network matching\n6. Implement monitoring logic for RPC call success/failure tracking\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Read /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md using Read tool to extract section 2.2 specifications\n2) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json to understand the agent structure pattern\n3) Read 2-3 example agent JSONs to understand the schema (name, description, permissions, decisions, workflow, etc.)\n4) Design the daemon_pool_connector agent JSON with:\n   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)\n   - Permissions array: [\"read\", \"write\", \"edit\", \"bash\", \"glob\", \"grep\"]\n   - Decisions array: [\"connection_established\", \"connection_failed\", \"rpc_validated\", \"error\"]\n   - Workflow sections for:\n     * Reading pool configuration for daemon RPC settings\n     * Establishing RPC connection to daemon\n     * Testing getinfo RPC call\n     * Testing getblocktemplate RPC call\n     * Validating authentication credentials\n     * Verifying network type matches (regtest)\n     * Monitoring and logging RPC call results\n   - Error handling for connection failures\n   - Success criteria and exit conditions\n5) Write the complete agent JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json using Write tool\n6) Validate JSON syntax is correct\n\nTEST_CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Handle missing or invalid daemon RPC configuration (host, port, username, password)\n- Test authentication failure scenarios\n- Test network mismatch (e.g., daemon on mainnet vs pool expecting regtest)\n- Handle daemon not running or unreachable\n- Test timeout scenarios for RPC calls\n- Verify proper error messages for each failure mode\n- Test successful connection with valid credentials on correct network\n- Ensure monitoring captures both successful and failed RPC attempts\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Content of section 2.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing exact requirements\n- Example agent JSON structure from existing agents\n- Complete daemon_pool_connector.json file with all required fields\n- JSON structure validation showing proper syntax\n- Mapping between plan requirements and agent workflow steps\n\nCONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task is well-defined with specific requirements, permissions, and decisions listed. Success depends on understanding the existing agent pattern structure and accurately translating section 2.2 requirements into the JSON workflow format. Uncertainty exists around the exact JSON schema format used by this agent system, but examining existing agents will clarify this.\n\n[DECISION: design_complete]\n\nDECISION: design_complete",

      "output": "ASSESSMENT:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear understanding that the task involves creating an agent JSON file based on section 2.2 of a planning document\n- Logical progression: read requirements → study existing patterns → design agent → write file\n- Explicitly lists all required permissions and decisions from the user's requirements\n- Addresses important test considerations (authentication failures, network mismatches, daemon unreachability)\n- Plans to examine existing agents for schema consistency\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Missing Critical File Verification**: The plan assumes MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists but doesn't verify this first. If section 2.2 doesn't exist or is incomplete, the entire plan fails without fallback.\n\n2. **Vague Workflow Design**: Step 4 lists high-level workflow sections (\"Reading pool configuration\", \"Establishing RPC connection\") but doesn't specify:\n   - Exact JSON structure/schema for workflows\n   - How workflows are defined (scripts? commands? declarative steps?)\n   - How RPC calls are actually executed within the agent framework\n   - How decisions are triggered/evaluated\n\n3. **No Concrete Evidence Collection**: The \"EVIDENCE\" section lists what will be shown, but doesn't specify HOW this evidence proves correctness:\n   - What specific validations will confirm the JSON is functionally correct?\n   - How will we verify the agent actually works before considering the task complete?\n   - No mention of testing the generated agent or validating it against a schema\n\n4. **JSON Syntax Validation Only**: Step 6 only mentions validating JSON syntax, not semantic correctness or agent framework compatibility\n\n5. **Unknown Schema Risk**: Acknowledges uncertainty about \"exact JSON schema format\" but confidence is still \"Medium-High\" - this seems overconfident given the schema is critical to success\n\n6. **No Integration Verification**: Doesn't plan to verify that:\n   - The agent file is in the correct location\n   - The agent can be loaded by whatever system uses these agents\n   - The permissions/decisions map correctly to the agent framework's expected format\n\nEVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**\n\nThe proposed evidence only demonstrates that a JSON file was created with certain content, NOT that:\n- The agent will actually function in the target system\n- The workflow correctly implements section 2.2 requirements\n- The RPC connection logic is properly structured\n- The decisions trigger appropriately\n\nStrong evidence would include:\n- Schema validation against agent framework requirements\n- Functional test or dry-run of the agent\n- Side-by-side comparison showing all section 2.2 requirements are addressed\n- Verification that the agent matches the pattern/structure of working agents\n\nDECISION: REJECTED\n\n**Specific Reasoning:**\nThe plan lacks concrete verification steps to prove the generated agent will actually work. While it shows understanding of the high-level requirements, it doesn't demonstrate how to translate those into the specific JSON workflow format used by this agent system. The confidence level is not justified given the acknowledged uncertainty about the exact schema. The plan needs:\n\n1. Explicit schema validation step (not just JSON syntax)\n2. Detailed specification of how workflow steps are structured in the JSON\n3. Concrete verification that each section 2.2 requirement maps to a workflow step\n4. Either a test execution or comparison against known-working agent patterns to prove functional correctness\n\nDECISION: REJECTED",

Design the agent JSON with appropriate states, transitions, permissions, and decision points\n4.

Confidence is medium-high rather than high because:\n1. Need to verify the exact schema format from existing agents\n2. Section 2.2 content is unknown until read\n3.

Creating a file ≠ proving it functions.\n\n2. **No Functional Validation**: Missing concrete steps to TEST the created agent JSON:\n   - No mention of validating JSON syntax\n   - No plan to verify the agent can actually be loaded/executed\n   - No integration test with actual daemon/pool components\n   - States are designed but no verification they transition correctly\n\n3. **Schema Compliance Uncertainty**: While it plans to examine existing agents, there's no explicit verification step confirming the new JSON matches required schema. Just \"comparison\" is mentioned in evidence but not as a validation step.\n\n4. **Missing Concrete Deliverables**: \n   - No sample RPC commands/responses to validate against\n   - No specific config file locations to test with\n   - No verification that permissions are sufficient for required operations\n\n5. **Confidence Justification Weak**: \"Medium-High\" confidence is concerning given uncertainties about schema format and section 2.2 content.

The agent JSON is syntactically valid\n2. The state machine logic is sound\n3. The agent can execute successfully\n4.
