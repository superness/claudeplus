First read `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` to see what commands are registered\n2. Look for the `registerCommandHandlers()` method which contains all available commands\n3. ONLY use commands that are actually registered in that file\n\n**Example of reading available commands:**\n```bash\ngrep \"commandHandlers.set\" /mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js\n```\n\nThis will show lines like:\n```\nthis.commandHandlers.set('getShipState', ...);\nthis.commandHandlers.set('setThrottle', ...);\n```\n\nIf a command you need is NOT in that list, use DECISION: need_command_implementation\n\n## WebSocket Server Architecture\n\n**Your script MUST:**\n1. Start a WebSocket server on port 8765\n2. Handle connections from both the game (browser) and test client\n3. Route commands from test client to game\n4. Route responses from game back to test client\n5. Include a 'listCommands' call as the FIRST command to verify what's available\n\n## AVAILABLE GAME COMMANDS (COMPLETE LIST)\n\nThese are the ONLY commands currently implemented in GameTestingInterface.js.\n**DO NOT use commands that are not on this list!**\n\nIf the bug you need to test requires a command that doesn't exist, use DECISION: need_command_implementation\n\n### Ship State Queries\n\n**getShipState** - Get current ship state\n```javascript\n{command: 'getShipState', params: {includeModules: true, includeInventory: false}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {\n//   position: {x, y, z},\n//   velocity: {x, y, z},\n//   rotation: {x, y, z, w},\n//   throttle: 0-100,\n//   shipType: 'Atron',\n//   hull: 100,\n//   capacitor: 100,\n//   isDocked: false,\n//   isWarping: false,\n//   fittedModules: [...]\n// }}\n```\n\n**getSceneInfo** - Get scene information\n```javascript\n{command: 'getSceneInfo', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {stations: [], celestials: [], ships: []}}\n```\n\n### Ship Control Commands\n\n**setThrottle** - Set ship throttle (0-100)\n```javascript\n{command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 75}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {throttle: 75}}\n```\n\n**dock** - Dock at nearest station\n```javascript\n{command: 'dock', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {docked: true, station: \"station_001\"}}\n```\n\n**undock** - Undock from station\n```javascript\n{command: 'undock', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {docked: false}}\n```\n\n### Inventory & Fitting Commands\n\n**getInventory** - Get cargo/inventory\n```javascript\n{command: 'getInventory', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {items: [{id, name, quantity, type}]}}\n```\n\n**fitItem** - Fit module to ship\n```javascript\n{command: 'fitItem', params: {itemId: 'shield_booster'}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {fitted: true, slot: \"utility_1\"}}\n```\n\n**unfitItem** - Unfit module from ship\n```javascript\n{command: 'unfitItem', params: {itemId: 'shield_booster'}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {unfitted: true}}\n```\n\n### Debug/Cheat Commands\n\n**setPosition** - Teleport ship to coordinates\n```javascript\n{command: 'setPosition', params: {x: 1000, y: 0, z: 500}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {position: {x: 1000, y: 0, z: 500}}}\n```\n\n**addResource** - Add resources/items to inventory\n```javascript\n{command: 'addResource', params: {resourceId: 'isk', amount: 1000000}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {added: true, newAmount: 1000000}}\n```\n\n**triggerCombat** - Spawn enemy NPCs for testing\n```javascript\n{command: 'triggerCombat', params: {enemyType: 'pirate', count: 3}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {spawned: 3, enemies: []}}\n```\n\n### Utility Commands\n\n**resetGameState** - Reset game to initial state\n```javascript\n{command: 'resetGameState', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {reset: true}}\n```\n\n**executeBatch** - Execute multiple commands in sequence\n```javascript\n{command: 'executeBatch', params: {commands: [{command: 'dock', params: {}}, {command: 'getInventory', params: {}}]}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {results: []}}\n```\n\n**listCommands** - Get list of all available commands\n```javascript\n{command: 'listCommands', params: {}}\n// Response: {success: true, data: {commands: [...]}}\n```\n\n## COMMANDS THAT DO NOT EXIST (Common Mistakes)\n\n**DO NOT USE THESE** - they are not implemented:\n- setNavigationTarget ❌\n- getNavigationState ❌\n- getInputState ❌\n- setAutopilot ❌\n- warpTo ❌\n- orbit ❌\n- approach ❌\n\nIf you need to test navigation/movement bugs, you MUST either:\n1.

      "output": "**AH! I found the problem!** \n\nLook at lines 210-214 and 223-227. The WebSocket server is acting as a simple relay:\n- When the game client sends a message, it forwards it to the test client\n- When the test client sends a message, it forwards it to the game client\n\nThe problem is on line 211-213: When the GAME sends a message (which should be a RESPONSE), it's forwarded to `testClient.send(msg)` - but `testClient` is NOT the same as the one that receives it!\n\nThe test client sends a command, it goes to the game, the game processes it and sends back a response, but that response goes to `testClient.send(msg)` which just sends the raw message. However, the test client has set up a handler on line 278: `testClient.on('message', handleGameResponse)` which should receive it.\n\n**Wait**, actually looking more carefully, the flow is:\n1. Test client sends command → server → game client\n2. Game client (browser) processes and sends response → server → test client\n\nThe issue is that the evidence shows the response is the COMMAND echoed back, not the actual response. This suggests the browser is sending the command back instead of the response.\n\nLet me check if there's an issue with how the browser is handling the command. The problem might be that `TestingBrowserBridge` is not correctly waiting for `gameInterface.handleCommand` to complete before sending the response.\n\nLooking at the evidence file again:\n```json\n\"response\": {\n  \"type\": \"command\",\n  \"command\": {\n    \"id\": \"1\",\n    \"command\": \"getShipState\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis looks like the browser is echoing back the command message it received, not sending the actual response. This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** - the command execution layer is broken.\n\n## Summary\n\n**EXECUTION RESULTS:**\n\n1. **Test script executed successfully** - WebSocket server started, Chrome launched, connections established\n2. **Framework error detected** - Commands are sent to the browser but responses are not returned correctly\n3. **Evidence captured** in `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763396347276.json`\n\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nThe test infrastructure has a critical bug where the browser's `TestingBrowserBridge` or `GameTestingInterface` is not correctly sending responses back to the test server. Instead of receiving the actual `getShipState` response with ship position/velocity data, the test receives an echo of the command itself.\n\n**IMPACT:**\nUnable to reproduce the ship navigation bug because the test framework itself is broken. The automation commands cannot get actual game state data.\n\n**NEXT STEPS NEEDED:**\n1. Fix the TestingBrowserBridge/GameTestingInterface response handling\n2. Ensure responses are properly formatted and sent back through WebSocket\n3. Re-run the reproduction script once framework is fixed\n\nDECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR",

This caused a format mismatch:\n\n- **Game sends:** `{type: 'response', response: {id, success, data, ...}}`\n- **Test client expects:** `{id, success, data, ...}`\n- **Result:** `response.id` was undefined, promises never resolved, test hung\n\n**Fix Applied:**\nModified the game→test relay (lines 210-227) to detect and unwrap response messages:\n\n```javascript\n// Unwrap response messages before forwarding to test client\ntry {\n  const parsed = JSON.parse(msg);\n  if (parsed.type === 'response' && parsed.response) {\n    // Unwrap: send the inner response object directly\n    testClient.send(JSON.stringify(parsed.response));\n  } else {\n    // Forward other messages as-is\n    testClient.send(msg);\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  // If parsing fails, forward as-is\n  testClient.send(msg);\n}\n```\n\n**Message Flow Verification:**\n✅ **Command Flow (Test → Game):**\n- Test sends: `{type: 'command', command: {...}}`\n- Relay forwards AS-IS (correct)\n- Game receives and processes (correct)\n\n✅ **Response Flow (Game → Test):**\n- Game sends: `{type: 'response', response: {...}}`\n- Relay unwraps to: `{...}` (FIXED)\n- Test receives unwrapped response (correct)\n\n**Impact:**\n- Framework can now successfully execute commands and receive responses\n- All test scenarios can now proceed beyond the first command\n- The ship navigation bug reproduction test can now run to completion\n\n**Next Step:**\nThe automation framework is now fixed and ready to retry the bug reproduction test. The test will now be able to execute all commands in the test scenario and properly detect whether the ship navigation bug exists.\n\nDECISION: framework_fixed_retry_reproduction",

The commands are being received but not executed, resulting in command echoes instead of actual responses.\n\n### Impact on Bug Investigation:\n**Cannot reproduce the ship navigation bug** because the test framework cannot communicate with the game to:\n- Get ship position/velocity\n- Set navigation targets\n- Verify ship movement\n\nThe framework must be fixed before the ship navigation bug can be properly investigated.\n\n---\n\n**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**",
