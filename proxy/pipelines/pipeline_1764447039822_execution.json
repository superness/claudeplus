Reasonable people can disagree on several fronts:\n- Whether creating another altcoin adds value or contributes to crypto fragmentation\n- Whether hobbyist mining satisfaction justifies a new blockchain vs. joining existing pools\n- Whether the 51% attack vulnerability of a small network undermines the project's viability\n- Whether \"educational value\" warrants real economic infrastructure\n\nThe thesis makes a clear value claim that can be challenged from multiple angles.\n\n---\n\n### SPECIFICITY_SCORE: 9/10\n**Explanation:** The thesis is exceptionally specific:\n- Target audience clearly defined (Bitaxe hobbyists with 500 GH/s - 1.2 TH/s devices)\n- Quantitative targets stated (blocks within 24-72 hours vs. 45,000+ years on Bitcoin)\n- Technical specifications detailed (2-minute blocks, 500 SAX reward, LWMA difficulty adjustment, 210M max supply)\n- Compatibility requirements explicit (SHA256d, stratum protocol, Bitcoin-derived codebase)\n\nThe only reason for not scoring 10/10 is the absence of specific governance or long-term sustainability metrics.\n\n---\n\n### EVIDENCE_SCORE: 9/10\n**Explanation:** The thesis is well-supported with:\n- Mathematical proof of the Bitcoin mining problem (1 TH/s ÷ 600 EH/s = ~45,000 years to find a block)\n- Technical implementation details (LWMA algorithm with Python pseudocode)\n- Comparative analysis tables (Bitcoin vs. SuperAxeCoin parameters)\n- Real device specifications (Bitaxe Ultra, Supra, Gamma hashrates and expected block times)\n- Precedent evidence (LWMA used successfully by Ravencoin, GRIN)\n\nThe evidence is concrete, verifiable, and directly supports the claims.\n\n---\n\n### ORIGINALITY_SCORE: 7/10\n**Explanation:** The thesis offers moderate originality:\n- **Novel combination:** Targeting Bitaxe specifically with optimized parameters is a fresh niche\n- **Problem reframing:** Positions hobbyist mining satisfaction as a legitimate design goal\n- **Community focus:** Explicitly prioritizes educational/hobbyist value over speculation\n\nHowever, the core technical approach (lower difficulty altcoin with faster blocks) has been done many times. The innovation is in the specific optimization for a hardware ecosystem (Bitaxe) rather than in the cryptographic or consensus mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### CLARITY_SCORE: 9/10\n**Explanation:** The document is exceptionally clear:\n- Well-structured with logical progression (problem → solution → specifications → implementation)\n- Technical terms explained when introduced\n- Tables and code examples enhance understanding\n- FAQ addresses anticipated objections\n- The core thesis is stated explicitly in the Executive Summary\n\nMinor deductions for some assumed knowledge of mining terminology and Bitcoin internals.\n\n---\n\n### OVERALL_SCORE: 8.4/10\n**Calculation:** (8 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 9) / 5 = 8.4\n\n---\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS: Specific Suggestions for Strengthening\n\n1. **Address the \"Why Not Testnet?\" Objection:** Explicitly explain why Bitcoin testnet or signet doesn't satisfy the hobbyist mining need (lack of permanence, no community value).\n\n2. **Economic Sustainability Analysis:** Add projections for what happens when large miners discover the network—will the difficulty adjustment protect hobbyists, or will they be priced out?\n\n3. **Governance Framework:** Define how parameters might be adjusted post-launch if assumptions prove incorrect.\n\n4. **Environmental Positioning:** Address the carbon footprint argument against new proof-of-work chains, even small ones.\n\n5. **Success Metrics:** Define measurable criteria for evaluating whether the project achieves its goals (e.g., \"80% of blocks found by devices under 5 TH/s\").\n\n6. **Differentiation from Similar Projects:** Briefly acknowledge and differentiate from other hobbyist-focused SHA256 coins (if any exist).\n\n---\n\n### APPROVAL: **APPROVED**\n\nThe design document presents a clear, well-reasoned thesis for creating SuperAxeCoin. It scores 8.4/10 overall, exceeding the 7.0 threshold. The technical specifications are sound, the problem statement is compelling, and the implementation approach is realistic. While there are areas for strengthening (particularly around long-term sustainability and governance), the thesis as presented is academically rigorous and ready for refinement.\n\n---\n\nDECISION: APPROVED",

      "output": "Now I have a complete understanding of the design document. Let me provide the thesis refinement based on the evaluation feedback.\n\n---\n\n## REFINED_THESIS\n\n**SuperAxeCoin (SAX) is a purpose-built SHA256 cryptocurrency that restores the original promise of decentralized mining by engineering block discovery parameters—120-second blocks, floor difficulty of 1.0, LWMA per-block adjustment, and 500 SAX rewards—specifically calibrated so that Bitaxe hobbyists (500 GH/s–1.2 TH/s) can realistically solo-mine blocks within 24–72 hours, transforming cryptocurrency mining from an industrial oligopoly back into an educational, achievable, and personally rewarding pursuit.**\n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT_OUTLINE\n\n**1. The Accessibility Argument (Problem-Solution)**\n- Bitcoin's 600 EH/s network makes solo mining with a Bitaxe statistically impossible (~45,000 years per block)\n- Pool mining abstracts away the core learning experience of blockchain mechanics\n- SAX's parameter engineering (2-min blocks, minimum difficulty 1.0, LWMA adjustment) mathematically restores solo mining viability to Bitaxe-class hardware\n\n**2. The Technical Feasibility Argument (Implementation)**\n- SHA256d maintains full ASIC and stratum protocol compatibility—no firmware changes required\n- LWMA difficulty adjustment (proven in Ravencoin, GRIN) ensures stable 2-minute blocks despite hashrate volatility\n- Bitcoin Core fork minimizes novel code, leveraging battle-tested security infrastructure\n\n**3. The Community Value Argument (Purpose)**\n- Fair launch principles (no premine, no ICO) align incentives with organic community growth\n- Educational value: miners learn real blockchain mechanics with tangible, achievable results\n- Fills a specific niche—the Bitaxe hardware ecosystem—rather than competing as a general-purpose currency\n\n---\n\n## COUNTERARGUMENTS\n\n**1. \"Why not just use Bitcoin testnet or signet?\"**\n- *Response needed:* Testnet coins lack permanence, community value, or psychological reward; signet is centrally controlled. SAX provides a persistent, decentralized network where block discoveries matter.\n\n**2. \"Another altcoin adds to crypto fragmentation\"**\n- *Response needed:* SAX explicitly targets an underserved niche (hobbyist ASIC miners) rather than competing for general adoption. It's a vertical solution, not a horizontal one.\n\n**3. \"51% attack vulnerability makes this insecure\"**\n- *Response needed:* Checkpoints, community monitoring, and exchange confirmation policies mitigate risks. The target use case (hobbyist mining, education) doesn't require Bitcoin-grade security guarantees.\n\n**4. \"Large miners will dominate once discovered\"**\n- *Response needed:* LWMA difficulty adjustment scales to any hashrate. Community ethos and niche focus naturally discourage industrial mining operations seeking ROI.\n\n---\n\n## EVIDENCE_PLAN\n\n| Evidence Type | Purpose | Sources |\n|---------------|---------|---------|\n| **Mathematical Proof** | Demonstrate Bitcoin mining impossibility | Network hashrate data, probability calculations |\n| **Technical Specifications** | Validate parameter choices | Bitcoin Core documentation, LWMA algorithm papers |\n| **Comparative Analysis** | Differentiate from alternatives | Testnet/signet feature comparison, altcoin landscape |\n| **Hardware Performance Data** | Prove achievability claims | Bitaxe official specs, real-world hashrate benchmarks |\n| **Precedent Evidence** | Validate LWMA reliability | Ravencoin, GRIN, Digibyte implementation histories |\n| **Community Research** | Demonstrate demand | Bitaxe Discord sentiment, solo mining forum discussions |\n\n---\n\n## WRITING_TIPS\n\n1. **Lead with the Bitaxe owner's pain point.** The 45,000-year calculation is viscerally effective—use it prominently in introductions and abstracts.\n\n2. **Add a \"Why Not Testnet?\" section.** This is the most common objection. Directly address it with concrete differences: permanence, decentralized control, community value.\n\n3. **Define success metrics.** Add measurable goals: \"Success = 80%+ of blocks found by devices under 5 TH/s in Year 1.\" This makes the thesis falsifiable and rigorous.\n\n4. **Include a governance framework stub.** Even if minimal, acknowledge how parameters could be adjusted post-launch if assumptions prove incorrect.\n\n5. **Add an environmental positioning paragraph.** Pre-empt the \"new PoW chain = wasteful\" critique by noting SAX's ultra-low power profile (15-25W devices) and educational efficiency.\n\n6. **Create a differentiation table for similar projects.** If other hobbyist SHA256 coins exist, explicitly compare. If none exist, state that SAX fills an unoccupied niche.\n\n7. **Strengthen the FAQ.** The current FAQ is solid but should include: \"Why not testnet?\", \"What happens when big miners arrive?\", and \"How do you prevent 51% attacks?\"\n\n---\n\nDECISION: refinement_complete",
