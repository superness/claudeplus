      "userContext": "Alright boys we making a Warhammer 40k MMO that plays like guild wars 1 or what. We got documentation. We got backend server archetecture. Look around and build a game client out of our designs that looks and feels like guild wars 1. Inspired in the 40k universe. 3D third-person perspective similar to Guild Wars 1. Continue where we left off - combat needs more validation. \n Henchman fit in perfectly to the 40k system\nSmall tactical missions on rails where you just murder hordes of enemies \nInsane class diversity\nyou can drop little nuggets of tough enemies with the minoris, majoris, extremis, terminus classifications\nlike it's right there\nwhite, blue, yellow, purple enemies\n\nMake sure to use the Guild Wars class\\subclass system + skills systems for insane diversity\nMake sure to use henchmen\\heros\n\n\"Combat working\" is way more than just the damage chain:\n\n  - Skill visual effects / animations\n  - Damage numbers floating up\n  - Enemy AI fighting back\n  - Companion AI using their skills\n  - Companions following/positioning\n  - Health bars updating\n  - Sound effects\n  - Skill cooldown visuals\n  - Death animations\n  - Loot drops visible\n  - etc.",
