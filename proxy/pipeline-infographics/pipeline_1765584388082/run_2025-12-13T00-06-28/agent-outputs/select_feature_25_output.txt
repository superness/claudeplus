Based on the previous stage information and my review of the UI code, I can now determine the next feature:

## Next Feature: Skills System

### Already Implemented
1. **Player character** - Player.ts exists with movement and skill slots
2. **Basic map/world** - World.ts creates 3D environment with gothic buildings
3. **Collision** - CollisionSystem.ts exists
4. **Enemy spawning** - EnemyTemplates.ts and Enemy.ts exist
5. **Basic combat** - CombatSystem.ts and Skills.ts exist with damage types
6. **Health/death** - Player has HP system, UI shows health bars
7. **UI elements** - UI.ts has health/energy bars, SkillBar.ts, CombatFeedback.ts, target frames, chat, party frames

### Why This Feature
Looking at the priority list:
- Features 1-7 are fully implemented (player, world, collision, enemies, combat, health/death, UI elements)
- Feature 8 is **Skills System** - while there's a SkillBar UI and skill definitions, the full Guild Wars 1-style skill system needs:
  - Skill acquisition and unlocking
  - Skill deck/build management (equipping skills to the bar)
  - Skill points and progression
  - Secondary profession skill access
  - Skill trainers/capture mechanics

The current implementation has skill definitions and UI but lacks the actual skill management system that makes Guild Wars 1 special - collecting skills, building custom skill bars, and skill-based character builds.
