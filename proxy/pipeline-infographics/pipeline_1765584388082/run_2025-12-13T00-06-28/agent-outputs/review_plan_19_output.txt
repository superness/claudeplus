### Ready for Implementation

The requirements capture the design intent faithfully. Key observations:

1. **Specific Numbers**: All formulas, damage values, cooldowns, and durations match the design docs exactly
2. **No Generic Placeholders**: Requirements use documented specifics (e.g., "80 damage" not "medium damage")
3. **Guild Wars 1 Philosophy Preserved**: Skill-based, 8-slot bar, no auto-attack
4. **Warhammer 40K Aesthetic**: Faction-specific mechanics and damage types properly captured
5. **Implementation Checklist Aligned**: The checklist items directly reference documented mechanics

The requirements are complete and faithful to the original design documents. Proceed to implementation.
