## Next Feature: Enemy Spawning

### Already Implemented
1. **Player character** - WASD and click-to-move movement with Space Marine placeholder model
2. **Basic map/world** - Tile-based environment with gothic buildings, industrial pipes, sky dome, atmospheric particles
3. **Collision** - Box and cylinder colliders with GW1-style wall sliding
4. **UI elements** - GW1-style 8+1 skill bar with cooldowns, health/energy bars, tooltips
5. **Skill bar system** - Skill slots with placeholder skills, cooldown overlay, activation animations

### Why This Feature
Following the priority list, features 1-3 (player, world, collision) and 7 (UI elements) are complete. The next feature in sequence is **#4: Enemy spawning**. The client has a working player that can move around the 3D world with collision, but there are no enemies to fight. Before we can implement basic combat (#5), we need enemies to exist in the world. The grep search for "enemy" or "spawn" returned no results, confirming no enemy system exists yet.
