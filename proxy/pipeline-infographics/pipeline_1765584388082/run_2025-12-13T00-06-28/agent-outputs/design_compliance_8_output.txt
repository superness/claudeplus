Now I have a complete picture of the implementation vs design docs. Let me provide my compliance check.

## Compliance Check: PASSED

### Verified Elements

#### 1. 3D Third-Person Perspective (Guild Wars 1 Style)
**Design says:** "3D third-person perspective similar to Guild Wars 1"
**Implementation has:**
- `ThirdPersonCamera.ts` implements orbital camera with distance 15, min/max zoom (5-30)
- FOV set to 55° in `Game.ts:73` ("slightly narrower for GW1 feel")
- Right-click camera rotation, smooth follow behavior

#### 2. Guild Wars 1 Skill Bar (8+1)
**Design says:** "8-skill hotbar (Guild Wars 1 style)" with "1 elite skill equipped at a time"
**Implementation has:**
- `index.html:61-114` defines 8 regular skill slots + 1 elite slot
- `Player.ts:84-92` initializes 9 skill slots with `skillId`, `cooldown`, `maxCooldown`, `isReady`
- `SkillBar.ts` manages cooldown overlays as designed
- Elite slot has distinct visual styling with gold border (`main.css:342-357`)

#### 3. Warhammer 40K Visual Aesthetic
**Design says:** "grim dark 40K atmosphere", faction colors for Imperial, Tau, Ork
**Implementation has:**
- CSS variables include: `--imperial-gold: #c9a227`, `--imperial-red: #8b0000`, `--tau-ochre: #d4a84b`, `--ork-green: #3d5c3d` (`main.css:7-19`)
- Grim dark sky dome with shader gradient (`World.ts:196-232`)
- Atmospheric particles (ash/dust falling) (`World.ts:296-318`)
- Gothic architecture with spires (`World.ts:237-291`)
- Player model uses Imperial red and gold trim (`Player.ts:116-189`)

#### 4. Skill System Matches Design Docs
**Design says:** Skills like "Holy Strike", "Shield of Faith", "Righteous Fury", "Cleansing Flame"
**Implementation has:** `SkillBar.ts:19-92` defines placeholder skills matching design:
- Holy Strike, Shield of Faith, Righteous Fury, Cleansing Flame, Divine Grace, Provoke, Shield Wall, Blessed Refrain, Eternal Zeal (Elite)

#### 5. Combat Stats Per Design
**Design says:** "Energy = 50 + (Willpower × 0.25)", "Base regen: 3 per second"
**Implementation has:**
- `Player.ts:427-434` implements 3 energy per second regen
- Stats structure includes health, maxHealth, energy, maxEnergy, level, experience

#### 6. Character Class Identity
**Design says:** Imperial faction with Crusader class
**Implementation has:**
- `index.html:38` shows "Brother Titus" as "Lv. 15 Crusader"
- Player visual uses Imperial red/gold colors

#### 7. UI Layout (Guild Wars 1 Inspired)
**Design says:** Guild Wars 1-style interface
**Implementation has:**
- Top-left: Character portrait + health/energy bars
- Bottom-center: Skill bar with experience bar below
- Top-right: Minimap with zone name
- Bottom-left: Chat box with party/system messages
- Proper tooltip system showing skill info, energy cost, cooldown

#### 8. Movement System
**Design says:** Click-to-move + WASD movement with collision
**Implementation has:**
- `Player.ts` supports both `moveTo()` for click-to-move and `setMoveDirection()` for WASD
- `CollisionSystem.ts` implements Guild Wars 1-style wall sliding
- 6 buildings and 8 pipes with proper collision detection

### Design Fidelity Score: 8/10

**Strong Points:**
- Skill bar layout and mechanics match GW1 exactly (8+1 format)
- Visual aesthetic is clearly Warhammer 40K with correct faction colors
- Energy regeneration rate matches design (3/sec)
- Third-person camera with orbital controls matches GW1 feel
- Character class names match design docs (Battle Sister abilities shown)

**Minor Gaps (not violations):**
- Skill icons are placeholder colors rather than actual artwork (expected for prototype)
- Combat system is client-side only (backend connection not active)
- Only one character class visualized (normal for initial implementation)
- No actual enemy entities yet (prototype stage)

These are expected gaps for a prototype stage, not design violations. The architecture correctly supports all documented systems.
