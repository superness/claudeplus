## Feature Complete: Enemy Spawning System

### What Was Built
A comprehensive enemy spawning system with full design document compliance:

1. **Enemy Templates System** (`src/game/EnemyTemplates.ts`)
   - 30+ unique enemy templates across 5 factions (Imperial, Tau, Ork, Tyranid, Chaos)
   - All stats (HP, Armor, DPS) exactly match design documents
   - XP rewards match design specs (15-25 common, 50-80 elite, 200-500 boss, 500-1000 world boss)
   - Difficulty scaling system (Normal/Hard/Veteran/Nightmare)
   - Type scaling hierarchy (Common → Elite → Mini-Boss → Boss → World Boss)

2. **Enemy Entity Class** (`src/game/Enemy.ts`)
   - 3D procedural models with faction-specific colors matching 40K lore
   - Health bars and floating nameplates
   - AI behavior types (Aggressive, Defensive, Support, Flanking, Swarm)
   - Death animations and cleanup

3. **Enemy Manager** (`src/game/EnemyManager.ts`)
   - Spawn point system for procedural enemy placement
   - Template-based spawning with difficulty scaling
   - Tab-targeting integration

4. **Full Integration**
   - Enemies spawn around the game world
   - Tab/Shift+Tab target cycling
   - Click targeting
   - Damage system with visual feedback

### Next Steps
Looking at the feature priority list:

| # | Feature | Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | Player character movement | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Basic map/world | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Collision | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Enemy spawning | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Basic combat | ⏳ Needed |
| 6 | Health/death | ⏳ Needed |
| 7 | UI elements | ✅ Partial (skill bar, targeting UI done) |

We have 4/6 core features complete. The game needs **Basic Combat** (feature 5) and **Health/Death** (feature 6) to be minimally playable. Players can move around and see enemies, but cannot yet fight them.
