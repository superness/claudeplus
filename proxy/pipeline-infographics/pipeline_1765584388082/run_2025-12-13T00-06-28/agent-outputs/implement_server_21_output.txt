Now let me write a summary.

## Server Changes

I've implemented comprehensive backend support for the combat system that matches the client's skill definitions.

### New Files Created

**`src/data/seeds/skill-definitions.seed.ts`**
- Complete skill definitions for all 4 playable classes matching the client:
  - **Battle Sister** (9 skills including Elite: Eternal Zeal)
  - **Guardsman** (9 skills including Elite: For the Emperor!)
  - **Choppa Boy** (9 skills including Elite: Mega Choppa Slam)
  - **Fire Warrior** (9 skills including Elite: Rail Rifle Overcharge)
- Skill registry with lookup by ID, class, and default loadout functions
- Each skill includes: energy cost, cooldown, cast time, damage type, base damage/healing, applied/removed conditions, target type, range, AoE radius, scaling attributes

### Files Modified

**`src/models/enums.ts`**
- Added missing `ConditionType` values: `DAZE`, `SILENCE`, `IRON_WILL`, `RECENTLY_KNOCKED_DOWN`
- Added missing `TargetType` values: `PBAE` (point-blank AoE), `PARTY`

**`src/services/combat.service.ts`**
- Imported skill definitions and enum types
- Updated `useSkill()` method to:
  - Look up actual skill data by ID
  - Use real energy costs from skill definitions
  - Calculate cooldowns from skill definitions (converted from seconds to ms)
  - Calculate damage with attribute scaling
  - Calculate healing with attribute scaling
  - Apply conditions from skill definitions
- Added `resolveSkillTargets()` method for proper target resolution based on skill target type (SELF, ENEMY, ALLY, PARTY, PBAE, CONE, GROUND)
- Added `calculateSkillDamage()` and `calculateSkillHealing()` methods with scaling
- Added `isInRange()` and `isInCone()` helper methods for AoE targeting
- Updated `SkillEffectData` interface to support condition application

**`src/api/combat.api.ts`**
- Added 4 new REST endpoints for skill data:
  - `GET /api/v1/skills` - Returns all skills
  - `GET /api/v1/skills/:skillId` - Returns specific skill by ID
  - `GET /api/v1/skills/class/:classId` - Returns all skills for a character class
  - `GET /api/v1/skills/class/:classId/loadout` - Returns default skill bar loadout

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/skills` | List all 36 skills across all classes |
| `GET /api/v1/skills/IMP_BS_HOLY_STRIKE` | Get Holy Strike skill details |
| `GET /api/v1/skills/class/BATTLE_SISTER` | Get all Battle Sister skills |
| `GET /api/v1/skills/class/CHOPPA_BOY/loadout` | Get default loadout for Choppa Boy |

### Combat Flow

1. Client sends `USE_SKILL` message with `skillId`
2. Server looks up skill definition from `skill-definitions.seed.ts`
3. Server validates energy, cooldowns, and target
4. Server calculates damage/healing with attribute scaling
5. Server resolves targets based on skill's target type
6. Server applies effects to all valid targets
7. Server broadcasts result with actual cooldown times
