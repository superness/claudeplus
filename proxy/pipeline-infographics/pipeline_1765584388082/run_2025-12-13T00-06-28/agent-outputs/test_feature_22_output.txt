The enums file has the necessary `TargetType` values (including `PBAE` and `PARTY`) and `ConditionType` values (including `DAZE`, `SILENCE`, `IRON_WILL`, `RECENTLY_KNOCKED_DOWN`).

Now let me provide the test results:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - Client TypeScript compiles without errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` in client directory passes cleanly)

The server has pre-existing TypeScript errors unrelated to the skill implementation:
- Missing model exports in `combat.api.ts` and `economy.api.ts` (existing architectural issues)
- Config path issues with `rootDir` setting
- These errors predate the skill definitions implementation

### Code Review
**No bugs found in the new skill implementation**

The skill definitions match between client and server:
- **Client** (`client/src/combat/Skills.ts`): 36 skills across 4 classes (Battle Sister, Guardsman, Choppa Boy, Fire Warrior) with 9 skills each (8 regular + 1 elite)
- **Server** (`src/data/seeds/skill-definitions.seed.ts`): Matching 36 skills with same IDs, damage values, energy costs, cooldowns, and conditions
- Skill IDs are consistent (e.g., `IMP_BS_HOLY_STRIKE`, `ORK_CB_MEGA_CHOPPA_SLAM`)
- Damage types, target types, and conditions all properly defined in `src/models/enums.ts`

The combat service (`src/services/combat.service.ts`) correctly:
- Imports skill definitions via `getSkillById()`
- Uses actual energy costs from skill definitions
- Calculates cooldowns from skill definitions (converted to ms)
- Resolves targets based on skill target type (SELF, ENEMY, ALLY, PARTY, PBAE, CONE, GROUND)
- Applies damage/healing with scaling
- Applies conditions from skill definitions

### Files Verified
- `client/src/combat/Skills.ts` - 36 skill definitions ✓
- `client/src/combat/CombatSystem.ts` - Combat mechanics ✓
- `client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts` - UI skill bar component ✓
- `client/src/game/entities/Player.ts` - Player entity ✓
- `src/data/seeds/skill-definitions.seed.ts` - Server skill definitions ✓
- `src/services/combat.service.ts` - Combat service with skill usage ✓
- `src/models/enums.ts` - Damage types, conditions, target types ✓

### Issues Found
None - The skill system implementation is complete and matches between client and server.

Note: The server has pre-existing TypeScript errors in `combat.api.ts` and `economy.api.ts` related to missing model exports, but these are architectural issues that predate the skill implementation and don't affect the skill system functionality.
