Implementation is complete. Let me provide the summary:

## Implemented
Built a Guild Wars 1-style collision detection system for the Warhammer 40K game client with smooth wall-sliding behavior.

## Design Compliance

- **Requirement**: "6 buildings with exact positions and dimensions" (World.ts lines 178-185)
  - **Implementation**: Created BoxColliders for all 6 buildings at positions (30,30), (-40,20), (25,-35), (-30,-30), (50,0), (-50,10) with their exact w/h/d dimensions

- **Requirement**: "8 pipes at radius 60, each 1 unit radius, 15 units tall" (World.ts lines 222-232)
  - **Implementation**: Created CylinderColliders for 8 pipes distributed evenly at angle intervals around radius 60, with collision radius 1

- **Requirement**: "Player collision radius ~0.5 units based on CapsuleGeometry(0.4, 1.2)"
  - **Implementation**: CollisionSystem uses playerRadius = 0.5 for collision detection

- **Requirement**: "Guild Wars 1 collision style - sliding along walls, not hard stop"
  - **Implementation**: `resolveCollision()` tries X-only movement, then Z-only movement before blocking, creating smooth wall-sliding behavior

- **Requirement**: "WASD collision needs implementation in updateMovement()"
  - **Implementation**: Player.updateMovement() now calls `applyCollision()` for WASD movement

- **Requirement**: "Click-to-move collision check at target and during path"
  - **Implementation**: `moveTo()` uses `findNearestValidPosition()` for valid target, and movement uses collision sliding

- **Requirement**: "World needs getColliders() method"
  - **Implementation**: Added `getColliders()` to World.ts that returns array of Collider objects

## Files Modified
- `/client/src/game/systems/CollisionSystem.ts` (NEW) - Core collision detection and response
- `/client/src/game/World.ts` - Added collider data generation and getColliders() method
- `/client/src/game/entities/Player.ts` - Added collision integration in movement code
- `/client/src/game/Game.ts` - Wired up CollisionSystem during initialization

## How to Test
1. Run `npm run dev` in the client directory
2. WASD movement: Try walking into buildings/pipes - player should slide along them smoothly
3. Click-to-move: Click inside a building - player should navigate to nearest valid position
4. Walk along building corners - should slide naturally without getting stuck
5. Approach pipes - circular collision should push player around them smoothly

DECISION: client_only
