I've now verified the actual files. The extracted requirements are largely accurate, but I need to note some corrections for the line numbers since the file paths are different from what the extraction reported. Let me complete my review.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

**World.ts (Actual path: `/client/src/game/World.ts`)**
- Building configurations at lines 178-185 - **VERIFIED**: 6 buildings with exact positions and dimensions
- Pipe generation at lines 222-232 - **VERIFIED**: 8 pipes at radius 60, each 1 unit radius, 15 units tall
- Terrain height variation at lines 98-101 - **VERIFIED**: `Math.sin(x * 0.05) * 0.5 + Math.cos(z * 0.05) * 0.5`
- Ground size 500x500 at line 88 - **VERIFIED**

**Player.ts (Actual path: `/client/src/game/entities/Player.ts`)**
- Body CapsuleGeometry(0.4, 1.2) at line 114 - **VERIFIED**
- Body positioned at y=1.4 at line 121 - **VERIFIED**
- Ground clamping at line 344: `this.position.y = Math.max(0, this.position.y)` - **VERIFIED**
- No collision detection in movement code - **VERIFIED** (lines 309-345)
- Move speed = 10 at line 42 - **VERIFIED**

**InputManager.ts (Actual path: `/client/src/game/input/InputManager.ts`)**
- Click-to-move raycasting at lines 172-194 - **VERIFIED**
- Ground plane intersection at lines 186-191 - **VERIFIED**

**Combat Design Doc** - Guild Wars 1 style confirmed:
- `"Drawing from Guild Wars 1's combat DNA"` - line 8
- Movement skills like "Jump Jets: Leap to location, 12 sec CD, 800 range" - line 528-529
- "Vectored Thrusters: Dash through enemies" - line 530-531
- "Advanced Positions: Teleport to target location, 1200 range" - lines 475-476
- "180° frontal arc for melee attacks" - line 39
- "Immobilize: Cannot move (can still attack)" - line 195

### Implementation Checklist Validation

The checklist correctly identifies:
1. **Collision Data Structure** - Buildings and pipes need to be exposed
2. **Player Collision Radius** - ~0.5 units (based on CapsuleGeometry 0.4 radius)
3. **WASD Collision** - Needs implementation in `updateMovement()`
4. **Click-to-Move Collision** - Needs collision check at target and during path
5. **Ground Clamping** - Current simple clamping should account for terrain variation
6. **Sliding Response** - Guild Wars 1 style (slide along walls, don't stop dead)
7. **Collision Data Exposure** - World needs `getColliders()` method
8. **Performance** - 14 objects total, no spatial partitioning needed

### Minor Corrections Noted
- File paths in extraction were `/src/client/...` but actual paths are `/client/src/game/...`
- Line numbers mostly accurate after adjusting for correct file paths

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements correctly capture:
- All obstacle geometries (6 buildings, 8 pipes)
- Player collision dimensions
- Guild Wars 1 collision philosophy (smooth sliding, not hard stop)
- Current lack of collision detection in movement code
- All necessary implementation points

The requirements are faithful to the design documents and the existing codebase. The Guild Wars 1 collision style (sliding along walls) is appropriately inferred from the overall design philosophy.
