## Next Feature: Collision

### Already Implemented
1. **Player character** - Space Marine model that moves with WASD/arrow keys and click-to-move (`Player.ts`, `InputManager.ts`)
2. **Basic map/world** - Tile-based environment with ground plane, gothic buildings, atmospheric particles, sky dome (`World.ts`)

### Why This Feature
Looking at the priority list:
- Feature 1 (Player character) - **Done**: Player.ts has a Space Marine model with movement via WASD and click-to-move
- Feature 2 (Basic map/world) - **Done**: World.ts has ground plane, buildings, pipes, particles, lighting
- Feature 3 (Collision) - **NOT Done**: The player can walk through buildings freely. World.ts creates buildings but there's no collision detection in Player.ts - the player just clamps to ground Y=0

The current movement system in `Player.ts:343-345` only does ground clamping (`this.position.y = Math.max(0, this.position.y)`). There's no collision detection with the buildings created in `World.ts:178-213`. The player can walk through all obstacles.
