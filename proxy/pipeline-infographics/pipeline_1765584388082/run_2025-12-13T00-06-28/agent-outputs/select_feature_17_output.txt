## Next Feature: Basic Combat

### Already Implemented
1. **Player character** - ✅ Space Marine-style model, WASD movement, click-to-move
2. **Basic map/world** - ✅ 3D tile-based environment with gothic buildings
3. **Collision** - ✅ CollisionSystem with wall sliding
4. **Enemy spawning** - ✅ 30+ enemy templates, EntityManager, demo enemies in world
5. **Targeting system** - ✅ Tab targeting, click targeting, target UI
6. **Skill bar UI** - ✅ 8+1 skill slots with cooldowns and tooltips

### Missing for Combat
- Skills do **nothing** when used (only triggers cooldown, no damage dealt)
- No `dealDamage()` method connecting player attacks to enemies
- No skill definitions with damage/range/effects
- No combat resolution (player's `useSkill()` doesn't interact with `EntityManager`)
- Enemy `takeDamage()` exists but is never called

### Why This Feature
The player can move around, see enemies, and target them, but **cannot fight them**. The skill bar triggers cooldowns but skills have no combat effect. This is the critical missing link - players need to be able to attack enemies. Features 6+ (Health/death, UI, Skills system) all depend on having basic combat working first.
