## Current State

- **Client exists**: NO - No game client found. No `client/`, `public/`, or `frontend/` folders exist. No index.html or game.js files outside of node_modules.

- **Design docs**: EXTENSIVE
  - `combat-design.md` - Full GW1-style combat system with 12 classes across 3 factions
  - `player-experience.md` - Complete player journey simulations
  - `balance-analysis.md` - Balance tuning docs
  - `progression-design.md` - Leveling and progression systems
  - `systems-integration.md` - Cross-system integration
  - `data-model.md` - Database schema
  - `api-specification.md` - REST API specs
  - Plus: engagement-analysis, emergence-analysis, balance-audit

- **Backend code**: COMPREHENSIVE TypeScript/Express server
  - Full authentication system (JWT + refresh tokens)
  - Character management (3 factions, 12 classes)
  - Combat system with WebSocket handler
  - Skill system, inventory, quests, economy, social features
  - PostgreSQL database with migrations and seeds
  - Complete test suite

- **Can run**: YES - Backend server can run via `npm run dev`

## Recommendation

The backend is production-ready with solid architecture. The design documentation is exceptional - detailed GW1-style 8-skill bar combat, faction system (Imperial/Tau/Ork), comprehensive class designs, and player experience flows.

**What's missing: A 3D game client.** To build a Guild Wars 1-style 3D third-person client, we need:
1. A 3D rendering engine (Three.js, Babylon.js, or PlayCanvas)
2. Character models, environments, UI
3. WebSocket integration with the existing combat backend
4. Camera system, input handling, skill bar UI

This is a significant undertaking that requires setting up the client foundation first.
