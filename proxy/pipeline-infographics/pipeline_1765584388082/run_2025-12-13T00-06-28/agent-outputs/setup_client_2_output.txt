All files are created. Let me provide a summary of what was built.

## Summary

### What the User Requested
- Warhammer 40K MMO client that plays like Guild Wars 1
- 3D third-person perspective similar to Guild Wars 1
- Inspired by the Warhammer 40K universe

### What I Learned from the Design Docs
The documentation is comprehensive and describes:
- **Combat System**: GW1-style 8-skill bar + 1 elite slot, no auto-attack, skill-based combat
- **3 Factions**: Imperial (faith-based), Tau (coordinated ranged), Ork (WAAAGH! melee)
- **12 Classes**: 4 per faction with distinct roles (Tank, DPS, Support, Hybrid)
- **Progression**: Level 1-30 cap, horizontal progression, prestige ranks
- **Backend**: TypeScript/Express API with PostgreSQL, WebSocket for combat

### Framework Choice: Three.js
I chose **Three.js** because:
1. The game references Guild Wars 1 (a 3D third-person game)
2. Design docs describe a 3D world with buildings, particles, and environmental effects
3. Three.js is the most mature WebGL 3D library for this type of game
4. Perfect for third-person camera, ground-plane navigation, and skill effects
