The build succeeds. Now let me provide the summary.

## Implemented

I've implemented the full combat system for the Warhammer 40K: Imperium Divided game client based on the reviewed design requirements. The implementation includes:

### Combat System Core (`client/src/combat/CombatSystem.ts`)
- 8 damage types: Kinetic, Piercing (25% armor pen), Explosive, Rending (50% armor pen), Thermal, Electric, Warp (ignores armor), Photon
- 5 primary attributes: Strength, Ballistics, Toughness, Willpower, Initiative
- Derived stat formulas: Health = 200 + (Toughness * 5), Energy = 20 + (Willpower / 2)
- Armor penetration mechanics per damage type
- Damage calculation with soft cap (200) and hard cap (400) on attributes
- +200% damage bonus cap

### Status Effects System
- Damaging conditions: Bleeding (5 dmg/sec, 8s, 5 stacks), Burning (8 dmg/sec, 4s, 3 stacks), Poison (3 dmg/sec, 12s, 10 stacks), Corruption (10 Warp dmg/sec, 6s), Shock (6 dmg/sec, 3s)
- Control conditions: Stun (2s max), Knockdown (3s max, 5s immunity), Fear (4s max), Blind, Slow, Immobilize, Daze, Silence
- Beneficial conditions: Regeneration, Swiftness, Might, Aegis, Iron Will

- Explosion effects with expanding ring
- Healing particles (green rising)

### Updated Skill Bar (`client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts`)
