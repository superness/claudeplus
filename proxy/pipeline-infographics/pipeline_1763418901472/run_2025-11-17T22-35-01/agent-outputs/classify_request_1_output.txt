Let me analyze this request:

```json
{
  "classification": "FEATURE_REQUEST",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "While this involves modifying existing RadialHUD behavior, it requires implementing new functionality: (1) hover timer logic with 0.5s delay, (2) visual progress indicator that fills during hover, and (3) state management for the hover interaction. This goes beyond a simple parameter change (like setting a delay value) - it requires new UI components, animation logic, and interaction state tracking. The request is enhancing the UX with new visual feedback mechanics.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Improve radial HUD menu interaction by preventing accidental opening with 0.5s hover delay and progress indicator",
    "keyIndicators": ["improve", "implement", "visual indicator", "progress-style", "fills up"],
    "affectedArea": "RadialHUD UI system (js/ui/RadialHUD.js), potentially new CSS for progress indicator",
    "priority": "medium",
    "technicalRequirements": [
      "Add hover timer mechanism (0.5s threshold)",
      "Create visual progress indicator component",
      "Implement fill animation during hover",
      "Update RadialHUD opening logic to respect timer",
      "Handle hover interruption/cancellation"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Reasoning Details:**

This is a **FEATURE_REQUEST** rather than a QUICK_CHANGE because:

1. **New Component Required**: A progress indicator UI element needs to be created (not just modifying existing values)
2. **Complex Logic**: Timer management, state tracking (hovering vs not hovering), and animation coordination
3. **Multi-file Changes**: Likely requires changes to `RadialHUD.js` + new/updated CSS for the progress indicator
4. **UX Enhancement**: This is adding a new user interaction pattern, not just tweaking existing behavior

If the request was just "add a 0.5 second delay before the menu opens" (simple timer), that could be QUICK_CHANGE. But the visual progress indicator requirement elevates this to a feature enhancement.

DECISION: FEATURE_REQUEST
