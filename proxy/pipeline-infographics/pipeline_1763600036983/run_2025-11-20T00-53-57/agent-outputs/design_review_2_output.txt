ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of the stratum mining protocol, job notification format, and validation requirements. The designer correctly identifies the key components (mining.notify messages, job parameters, merkle branches, difficulty calculations).

2. **Logical Structure**: The 11-step approach follows a sound progression from reading requirements → analyzing existing patterns → researching protocols → designing components → implementation. This mirrors the successful pattern from previous agents.

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The 10 test scenarios are excellent, covering normal operation, edge cases (missing parameters, corrupted data), error conditions (no jobs, network failures), and real-world scenarios (rapid job changes, various pool implementations).

4. **Appropriate Tooling**: The specified tools (Bash for tcpdump/netcat, Read for logs, Grep for parsing, Write for output) are exactly what's needed for monitoring stratum traffic and validating job broadcasts.

**Critical Evaluation:**

1. **Evidence Collection is STRONG**: The 10 evidence items are concrete and verifiable:
   - Raw stratum JSON (observable network capture)
   - Parsed parameters (specific extractable values)
   - Field-by-field validation results (binary pass/fail with values)
   - Difficulty calculations (mathematically verifiable)
   - Merkle branch analysis (structural validation)
   - Timestamp checks (temporal verification)
   - Job update timeline (chronological sequence)
   - Network/log captures (raw data preservation)
   - Error documentation (failure forensics)

2. **Technical Accuracy**: The plan correctly identifies the stratum `mining.notify` method and all required fields (job_id, prevhash, coinb1, coinb2, merkle_branch, version, nbits, ntime, clean_jobs). This matches the stratum v1 protocol specification.

3. **Decision Keywords Match Requirements**: The five decisions (job_received, job_valid, job_invalid, no_jobs, error) directly satisfy the stated requirements and map to logical outcomes of job monitoring.

4. **Confidence Justification**: The "High" confidence is well-reasoned with 8 specific supporting points including protocol documentation, existing references, standard tooling, and clear requirements.

**Potential Concerns (Minor):**

1. The plan doesn't explicitly mention handling encrypted stratum connections (SSL/TLS), though this is likely acceptable for regtest monitoring.

2. No mention of handling different stratum variants (Stratum V2), but given this is for Bitcoin Core regtest with existing pools, Stratum V1 is appropriate.

3. Configuration values (port 3333, monitoring duration) aren't specified in detail, but the plan indicates these will be in the "configuration section" of the JSON.

These are very minor concerns that don't undermine the plan's viability.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The proposed evidence is concrete, verifiable, and comprehensive. Each of the 10 evidence items:
- Can be objectively collected (network captures, log files, parsed data)
- Provides specific values (not vague assessments)
- Enables verification of success criteria (all required fields present and valid)
- Supports debugging when issues occur (timestamps, sequences, error details)
- Covers both positive cases (valid jobs) and negative cases (validation failures)

The evidence directly proves whether the agent successfully monitors stratum jobs, parses all parameters, validates each field, and detects updates.

DECISION: APPROVED

**Reasoning**: This plan meets all criteria for approval:
1. ✅ Crystal clear understanding of stratum job validation requirements
2. ✅ Logical 11-step approach from research to implementation
3. ✅ Concrete, verifiable evidence (10 specific items) proving task completion
4. ✅ High confidence with solid technical justification
5. ✅ Comprehensive test scenarios covering real-world cases
6. ✅ Appropriate tools for network monitoring and log parsing
7. ✅ Decision keywords exactly match requirements

The plan will produce a functional job_validator agent that can monitor stratum traffic, validate all job parameters, and provide concrete evidence of successful validation.

DECISION: APPROVED
