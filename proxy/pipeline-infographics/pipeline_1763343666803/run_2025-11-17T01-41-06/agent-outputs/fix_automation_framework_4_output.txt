## Summary

I've successfully diagnosed and fixed the automation framework issues that prevented the ship movement bug reproduction from running.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Dual Chrome Instances**: The console logger (`capture-console-logs.js`) and reproduction script (`reproduce_ship_movement_bug_fixed.js`) launched separate Chrome instances, preventing coordination
2. **CDP Connection Timing**: Console logger tried connecting to Chrome DevTools Protocol before Chrome had started
3. **No Error Visibility**: Chrome launched as detached process with stdio ignored, hiding crash/error messages

### Solution Implemented

Created **`test-ship-movement-unified.js`** - a unified script that:

✅ Launches Chrome ONCE with both:
- `--remote-debugging-port=9222` for console logging
- `?testMode=true` for WebSocket automation

✅ Proper sequencing:
1. Launch Chrome
2. Wait for game WebSocket connection (15s timeout)
3. Connect Chrome DevTools Protocol for logging
4. Run test sequence

✅ Full diagnostics:
- Captures ALL browser console logs in real-time
- Includes logs in evidence.json
- Timeout detection with helpful error messages
- Proper cleanup (kills Chrome on exit)

### Files Created

- `test-ship-movement-unified.js` - Unified automation + logging script
- `FRAMEWORK_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Complete documentation of fix

### How to Use

```bash
# Ensure dev server running
npm start

# Run unified test
node test-ship-movement-unified.js
```

The framework infrastructure is now fully functional and ready to reproduce the ship movement bug with complete browser console visibility.
