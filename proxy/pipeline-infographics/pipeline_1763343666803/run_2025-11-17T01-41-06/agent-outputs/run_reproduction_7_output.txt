## SUMMARY

**Infrastructure failure detected.** The reproduction script encountered critical failures in two core components:

1. **Chrome DevTools Protocol Connection Failure:**
   - Chrome console logger attempted 30 connection retries over 60 seconds
   - Error: `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222`
   - Chrome was launched with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` but the debugging endpoint never became available

2. **Game WebSocket Connection Failure:**
   - WebSocket automation server started successfully on port 8765
   - Test client connected successfully
   - Game client NEVER connected to automation server
   - Error: "Cannot forward command: game client not connected"

**Observable Facts:**
- Dev server: Running on http://localhost:8080
- Console logger: Started, but failed to connect to Chrome CDP
- WebSocket server: Started successfully on port 8765
- Test client: Connected to WebSocket server
- Game client: Failed to connect to WebSocket server
- Chrome: Launched with remote debugging flag, but CDP endpoint unavailable
- Script: Manually killed after 4+ minutes of hanging
- Evidence: No new evidence file generated

**No test execution occurred.** The script could not proceed past infrastructure setup phase.
