Perfect! The reproduction script has been created. Now let me create a summary document for the output:

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the ship movement bug that:

**Test Procedure:**
1. Starts Chrome console logger to capture all browser output
2. Launches game with WebSocket automation enabled
3. Sets a navigation target 5000m away using the `setNavigationTarget` command
4. Monitors ship position and velocity over 10 seconds
5. Detects if ship is moving (velocity > 0.01 or position changed > 1.0m)

**Available Commands Used:**
- `listCommands` - Verify automation is working
- `getShipState` - Get ship position, velocity, throttle
- `setNavigationTarget` - Set navigation target (the command being tested)

**Bug Detection:**
- **BUG REPRODUCED** if: ship remains stationary (movement < 1.0m) despite valid navigation target
- **NOT REPRODUCED** if: ship moves toward target with non-zero velocity

**Evidence Captured:**
- All WebSocket commands and responses
- Ship states sampled every 1 second for 10 seconds
- Chrome console logs (console.log, console.error, exceptions)
- Movement metrics (position delta, velocity magnitude)

**Output:**
- Evidence file: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
- Console log file: `C:\GameLogs\chrome-console-[timestamp].log`

The script is ready to execute and will provide definitive proof of whether the ship movement bug exists.
