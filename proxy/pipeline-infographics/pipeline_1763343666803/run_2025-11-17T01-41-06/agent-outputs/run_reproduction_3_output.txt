## Summary

**Infrastructure failure detected - FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction script encountered two critical infrastructure failures:

1. **Chrome Console Logger Failure**: Logger attempted to connect to Chrome DevTools Protocol on port 9222 before Chrome started with debugging enabled, resulting in `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222`. Logger exited with code 1.

2. **Game WebSocket Connection Failure**: WebSocket server started successfully and test client connected, but the game client never connected. This indicates:
   - Game may not be loading TestingBrowserBridge.js
   - WebSocket connection failing in browser
   - Game initialization error preventing automation setup
   - testMode=true parameter not triggering automation

**Infrastructure Status:**
- HTTP dev server: RUNNING
- WebSocket server: RUNNING  
- Test client: CONNECTED
- Game client: NOT CONNECTED ← **Blocker**
- Console logger: FAILED
- Commands executed: 0
- Evidence collected: NONE

**No test execution occurred** - the automation framework failed to establish the game connection required to send commands and collect evidence.
