UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to execute a meta-pipeline that will build 18 specialized agents and 8 pipeline templates for a mining cycle automation system. This involves reading a development plan document and generating agent JSON files, pipeline templates, and documentation in specific directories.

APPROACH: I will read the development plan document to understand the specifications, then systematically create each agent JSON file and pipeline template according to the meta-pipeline stages (infrastructure → integration → validation → support → templates → validation → documentation). I'll follow the architectural patterns already established in the existing agents/ and templates/ directories.

STEPS:
1) Read `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` to understand full requirements and agent specifications
2) Examine existing agent JSON files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` to understand the JSON schema and prompt structure
3) Examine existing pipeline templates in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` to understand the template schema and stage structure
4) Create infrastructure agents (Stage 1): mining_cycle_coordinator, resource_tracker, performance_optimizer, mining_operation_executor
5) Create integration agents (Stage 2): blockchain_bridge, logistics_coordinator, market_intelligence, fleet_orchestrator
6) Create validation agents (Stage 3): mining_validator, economy_validator, performance_validator, safety_validator
7) Create support agents (Stage 4): mining_analyst, mining_debugger, mining_documentation, mining_test_generator, operations_monitor, mining_rollback_handler
8) Create 8 pipeline templates (Stage 5): mining-cycle-setup-v1.json, mining-operation-v1.json, mining-optimization-v1.json, mining-debug-v1.json, mining-integration-v1.json, mining-validation-v1.json, mining-rollback-v1.json, mining-monitoring-v1.json
9) Validate integration (Stage 6): Verify all JSON files are valid, check agent references in pipelines, ensure stage connections are correct
10) Generate documentation (Stage 7): Create comprehensive documentation in `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/docs/` covering agent catalog, pipeline workflows, integration patterns, and usage examples

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will validate that all JSON files are syntactically correct, agent names are consistent across references, pipeline stage connections are properly linked, file paths are correctly specified for all three target directories, and the generated artifacts match the specifications in the development plan. Will verify that the new agents follow the same schema patterns as existing agents (name, systemPrompt, allowedTools, model fields).

EVIDENCE: Will provide:
- List of all 18 agent JSON files created with file paths
- List of all 8 pipeline template JSON files created with file paths
- Sample content from key agents showing proper JSON structure
- Validation results confirming JSON validity and reference integrity
- Documentation file paths and structure overview
- Confirmation that files exist in correct directories using ls/file checks

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task is well-structured with clear stages and deliverables. The existing codebase provides excellent templates to follow. Main uncertainty is whether the development plan document contains complete specifications for all 18 agents and 8 templates, or if some details will need to be inferred from the mining cycle context. Will need to carefully map agent responsibilities to avoid overlaps and ensure proper pipeline flows.
