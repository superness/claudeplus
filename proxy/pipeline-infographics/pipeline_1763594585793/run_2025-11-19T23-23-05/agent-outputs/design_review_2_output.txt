ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates good comprehension of the task - creating a miner_manager agent JSON that handles mining operations based on section 2.1 of the automation plan
2. **Logical Approach**: The step-by-step methodology is sound:
   - Read the specification document first
   - Study existing agent patterns
   - Design based on learned schema
   - Implement the JSON file
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 7 requirements are acknowledged (configure, install, verify, generate config, wallet, start, monitor, stop)
4. **Good Evidence Planning**: Plans to show source documents, examples, and final output

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague Evidence Criteria**: "Will show mapping between requirements and prompt instructions" is not concrete - HOW will this mapping be verified? What specific checks will confirm each requirement is properly addressed?
2. **Missing Validation Steps**: No plan to validate the JSON syntax or test against the agent framework (if tooling exists)
3. **Ambiguous Success Criteria**: What makes the prompt "comprehensive enough"? What specific elements must be present?
4. **Confidence Justification**: "Medium-High" confidence with significant dependencies (clarity of section 2.1, schema consistency) suggests there are known risks not fully addressed
5. **No Verification Plan**: After writing the JSON, how will the planner verify it actually meets all requirements? Just showing content isn't proof it works

**Critical Gap:**
The plan lacks a concrete checklist or verification matrix. For example:
- "Each of the 7 requirements will have a corresponding section in the prompt with specific commands/logic"
- "Will grep the final JSON for each decision keyword to confirm all 4 are present"
- "Will verify JSON parses correctly with a validation tool"

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak** 

The proposed evidence is mostly "will show content" which proves the work was done but not that it was done *correctly*. There's no plan to provide:
- A requirement-to-implementation traceability matrix
- Specific verification that each requirement maps to actionable prompt text
- Validation that the JSON structure matches the schema requirements
- Confirmation that decision logic properly handles all scenarios

DECISION: REJECTED (Design needs stronger verification criteria and concrete success metrics)

The plan needs revision to include:
1. A specific checklist of what must be present in the agent JSON for each requirement
2. Concrete validation steps (JSON syntax check, keyword presence verification, schema compliance)
3. A traceability matrix showing requirement → prompt section → decision mapping
4. Clear pass/fail criteria for "complete and correct" implementation
