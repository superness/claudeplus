ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths of the Plan:**
1. **Systematic approach**: The plan correctly identifies the need to read the source document first, then examine existing agent structures before creating the new agent
2. **Comprehensive requirements coverage**: All 7 requirements from the user are explicitly listed
3. **Proper tool selection**: Appropriate use of Read, Glob, and Write tools
4. **Schema discovery**: Recognizes the need to examine existing agent JSON files to understand the correct format
5. **Error handling consideration**: Mentions edge cases and error handling in test considerations

**Weaknesses and Concerns:**
1. **Vague JSON structure**: Step 5 mentions creating "prompts/instructions" but doesn't specify HOW this maps to the actual JSON schema (is it a "prompt" field? "instructions"? "capabilities"? Arrays vs objects?)
2. **Missing schema validation**: No mention of validating the final JSON structure against the expected schema
3. **Incomplete evidence specification**: While it mentions "Complete JSON structure outline," it doesn't specify what concrete evidence will prove the agent actually works (e.g., testing the agent, validating against schema, checking all required fields exist)
4. **Workflow logic unclear**: Step 6 mentions "workflow logic and state transitions" but provides no detail on how this will be implemented in JSON
5. **Medium confidence without justification**: The plan acknowledges uncertainty about the JSON format but doesn't provide a fallback if the existing examples are inconsistent or missing
6. **No verification step**: Missing a step to verify the written JSON is valid (parseable, matches schema, includes all requirements)

**Critical Gaps:**
- No mention of how to structure the agent's actual decision-making logic
- Unclear how the "decisions" parameter maps to agent behavior
- No plan for testing if the generated JSON is functional
- Missing details on how multi-step operations (like "install then verify") will be structured

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence includes:
- ✓ Source document contents (good)
- ✓ Existing agent structures (good)
- ✓ Mapping requirements to capabilities (good)
- ✗ **No validation that the JSON is syntactically correct**
- ✗ **No verification that all required fields are present**
- ✗ **No testing of the agent's functionality**
- ✗ **No comparison against a schema/specification**

The plan will produce evidence of *understanding* but not concrete proof that the *implementation* is correct and functional.

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:**
The plan demonstrates good initial research methodology but lacks specificity in the implementation phase. It does not adequately specify:
1. How the JSON structure will be validated as correct and complete
2. What specific fields/schema the agent JSON must contain
3. How to verify that all 7 requirements are actually implementable with the proposed structure
4. Concrete validation steps to prove the agent works before considering the task complete

The plan should be revised to include:
- A validation step to check JSON syntax
- Schema verification against existing agent standards
- Explicit mapping of each requirement to specific JSON fields/sections
- A review step to ensure all permissions and decisions are properly integrated
- Clear success criteria (e.g., "JSON parses successfully AND contains all required sections AND matches existing agent schema")
