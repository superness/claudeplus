UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner_manager agent JSON file based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent should handle mining software configuration, installation, wallet management, mining operations, and monitoring with specific permissions and decision states.

APPROACH: First, I'll read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.1 requirements. Then I'll examine existing agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory to understand the proper structure and format. Finally, I'll create a comprehensive plan for structuring the miner_manager.json with all required capabilities.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/../MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (or search for it using Glob if path differs)
2) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand the schema structure
4) Extract section 2.1 requirements from the plan document
5) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decision states: ["miner_started", "miner_stopped", "miner_error", "error"]
   - Prompts/instructions for each requirement:
     * Mining software configuration
     * cpuminer installation/verification
     * Miner configuration generation
     * Wallet creation/import
     * Pool connection startup
     * Hashrate and submission monitoring
     * Graceful shutdown
6) Map out the workflow logic and state transitions
7) Define success criteria and error handling patterns
8) Plan the Write operation to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/miner_manager.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Verify the plan document exists and section 2.1 is accessible
- Handle cases where existing agent examples may have different schemas
- Ensure all 7 requirements are mapped to agent capabilities
- Validate that permission set matches requirements (Bash for mining commands, Read/Write for configs, etc.)
- Consider edge cases: missing dependencies, wallet already exists, miner already running, network connection failures
- Plan for graceful error handling with appropriate decision states

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Structure of existing agent JSON files showing the schema pattern
- Mapping of each requirement to specific agent prompts/capabilities
- Verification that all permissions and decisions are included
- Complete JSON structure outline before writing

CONFIDENCE: Medium - Need to verify the document structure and existing agent JSON schema first. The requirements are clear, but the exact JSON format depends on the existing agent framework structure which I need to examine.

DECISION: design_complete
