UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a `miner_manager` agent JSON configuration file based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent should handle cryptocurrency mining operations including configuration, installation, wallet management, and monitoring.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Examine existing agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory to understand the agent JSON schema and patterns
3. Design the agent structure with appropriate prompt, permissions, decisions, and tools
4. Map the requirements to specific agent capabilities and decision points
5. Create a comprehensive prompt that guides the agent through all mining management tasks

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` to understand section 2.1 requirements
2) Use Glob tool with pattern `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json` to find existing agent examples
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand the schema structure (fields like name, description, prompt, permissions, decisions, tools, etc.)
4) Design the agent JSON structure with:
   - name: "miner_manager"
   - description: Brief description of mining management capabilities
   - prompt: Comprehensive instructions covering all 7 requirements (configure, install, generate config, wallet, start, monitor, stop)
   - permissions: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"] as specified
   - decisions: ["miner_started", "miner_stopped", "miner_error", "error"] as specified
   - tools/other fields as per schema pattern
5) Create prompt sections for:
   - Installation verification (cpuminer or alternatives)
   - Configuration generation (pool connection details, wallet address)
   - Wallet creation/import procedures
   - Miner startup with proper parameters
   - Hashrate monitoring logic
   - Graceful shutdown procedures
   - Error handling and decision-making logic
6) Map each requirement to specific decision outcomes
7) Use Write tool to create the complete JSON at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/miner_manager.json`

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify agent handles missing cpuminer installation scenario
- Test with invalid pool connection parameters
- Handle wallet creation vs wallet import scenarios
- Test miner startup failures and appropriate error decisions
- Verify monitoring can detect zero hashrate or failed submissions
- Test graceful vs forceful shutdown scenarios
- Validate decision outputs match the 4 specified options
- Check JSON syntax validity
- Ensure prompt is comprehensive enough for autonomous operation

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the content of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Will display example agent JSON schemas from existing agents
- Will provide the complete miner_manager.json file content
- Will demonstrate JSON structure matches schema patterns
- Will show mapping between requirements and prompt instructions
- Will verify all 4 decision types are properly integrated

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires understanding both the mining automation plan specifications and the agent JSON schema format. Success depends on the clarity of section 2.1 in the plan document and the consistency of existing agent examples. The technical requirements are clear, but integration with the specific agent framework needs validation against existing patterns.

[DECISION: design_complete]
