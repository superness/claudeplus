## Conclusion

No reproduction script exists for this bug because:

1. **The `reproduction_creator` agent correctly determined** that this bug cannot be automated with the current framework
2. **The bug requires browser refresh testing** - which needs a `reloadPage` command that doesn't exist
3. **No recent reproduction scripts were created** - confirming the creator's decision

## Why This Bug Cannot Be Automated

The bug report states: **"fitted items are lost when the browser is refreshed"**

This requires:
1. Fitting items to the ship
2. **Triggering a full page reload** (F5 / location.reload())
3. Checking if fitted items persist after reload

The current ChromeManager framework:
- ✅ Can fit items via commands
- ✅ Can check ship state via commands
- ❌ **Cannot trigger page reload** - no command exists

Without a page reload, we cannot test localStorage persistence across sessions.
