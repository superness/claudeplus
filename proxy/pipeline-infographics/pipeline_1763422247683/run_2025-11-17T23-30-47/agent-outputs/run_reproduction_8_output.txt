**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction test encountered a framework-level issue. The script successfully:
1. ✅ Cleaned up old processes
2. ✅ Started HTTP server with caching disabled
3. ✅ Found the reproduction script
4. ✅ Launched Chrome with ChromeManager

However, the test **timed out at 120 seconds** during Phase 1 while trying to check the initial game state. The script was stuck waiting for the game to respond to test commands, indicating a communication breakdown between the test automation framework and the browser.

The HTTP server logs show the game loaded all modules correctly, but no evidence file was generated, meaning the test never progressed past the initial state check. This suggests a WebSocket relay or Chrome DevTools Protocol connectivity issue rather than a problem with the ship fitting code itself.
