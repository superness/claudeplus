There are no save/load commands in the testing interface. The bug requires testing **persistence across browser refresh**, which cannot be automated with the current framework because:

1. **ChromeManager maintains a persistent browser session** - It launches Chrome once and sends commands via WebSocket
2. **No page reload command exists** - There's no way to trigger a full page refresh that would reload from localStorage
3. **The bug symptom is "data lost on page refresh"** - This specifically requires closing and reopening the browser or refreshing the page

To properly test this bug, we would need a command like `reloadPage` that triggers `location.reload()` in the browser, which would:
- Destroy the current JavaScript state
- Reload index.html from scratch
- Re-initialize all game systems
- Attempt to load saved data from localStorage

This command doesn't exist yet and would need to be implemented.

**DECISION: need_command_implementation**

**Required Command:**
- **Command Name:** `reloadPage`
- **Purpose:** Trigger a full page reload (simulating browser refresh/F5)
- **Implementation:** Execute `window.location.reload()` in the game browser
- **Why Needed:** This bug specifically tests data persistence across page refreshes. Without the ability to reload the page via automation, we cannot verify that fitted items persist in localStorage after a refresh.

**Alternative Manual Test:**
Until the command is implemented, this bug must be tested manually:
1. Dock at station
2. Fit items to ship
3. Undock
4. Press F5 to refresh browser
5. Check if fitted items are still equipped
