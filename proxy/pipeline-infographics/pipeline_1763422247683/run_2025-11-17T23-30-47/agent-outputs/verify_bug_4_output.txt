## Verification Result

## Critical Finding

**NO RUNTIME EVIDENCE EXISTS** - This verification must return INCONCLUSIVE because:

1. ❌ **No evidence file exists** - No `*fitting*evidence*.json` file found
2. ❌ **No test execution** - The `reproduction_creator` correctly decided NOT to create a script
3. ❌ **No WebSocket responses** - No commands were executed
4. ❌ **No console logs** - No browser session was captured
5. ❌ **No runtime state** - No game state snapshots exist
6. ⚠️ **Framework limitation** - Bug requires `reloadPage` command that doesn't exist

## Why No Test Was Created

The `run_reproduction` stage output clearly states:

```
"reproductionCreatorDecision": "need_command_implementation",
"requiredCommand": "reloadPage",
"explanation": "This bug tests persistence across browser refresh, which cannot be automated without a reloadPage command"
```

This was the **correct decision** - attempting to verify fitted items without being able to reload the page cannot test localStorage persistence.

## Evidence Search Results

Searched for:
- `*ship*fitting*evidence*.json` → **0 files found**
- `*fitting*persistence*evidence*.json` → **0 files found**
- `*bug*evidence*.json` → **68 files found** (all for different bugs: ship_movement and instant_throttle)

None of the 68 existing evidence files are relevant to this ship fitting persistence bug.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (no runtime evidence - framework limitation prevents reproduction)
