**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction test failed due to infrastructure issues. The test successfully:
- ✅ Set up HTTP server with caching disabled
- ✅ Killed old Chrome processes
- ✅ Launched Chrome with ChromeManager
- ✅ Established WebSocket connections

But it failed at:
- ❌ Step 1: "Find nearby station" - hung for 4+ minutes
- ❌ No evidence file generated
- ❌ Test could not proceed to fitting items

This is a test automation framework error, not a conclusive result about the bug. The game may not be generating stations at initialization, or the automation framework cannot query game state to find stations. Manual testing or script modifications are needed to proceed.
