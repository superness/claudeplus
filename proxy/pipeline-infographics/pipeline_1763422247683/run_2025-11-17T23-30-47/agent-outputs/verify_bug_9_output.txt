I can see many evidence files from other bug tests, but NONE for ship fitting persistence. Let me verify what the run_reproduction stage actually reported:

## Verification Analysis

Based on my analysis of the available evidence:

### ❌ MANDATORY EVIDENCE CHECKLIST RESULTS

1. ❌ Evidence file exists - **NO** (no ship_fitting_persistence evidence files found)
2. ❌ Evidence file contains "commands" array - **NO** (no evidence file)
3. ❌ Evidence file contains "bugReproduced": true - **NO** (no evidence file)
4. ❌ Console log file path present - **NO** (no evidence file or console logs)
5. ❌ Console logs array populated - **NO** (no evidence file)
6. ❌ Test script was EXECUTED - **PARTIAL** (script exists but timed out, exit code 124)
7. ❌ Runtime state snapshots captured - **NO** (no evidence generated)

### Evidence Analysis

```json

  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "The reproduction test script was created and launched, but it TIMED OUT after 120 seconds during Phase 1 without generating any runtime evidence. The test never progressed past the initial state check, indicating a framework-level communication failure between the test automation and the browser. No evidence.json file was created, no console logs were captured, and no WebSocket command/response data was collected. Without actual runtime evidence, we cannot confirm whether the bug exists or not.",

    ]
  },
  "nextSteps": "Cannot proceed with bug verification due to test framework issues. Recommend manual testing or fixing the automation framework before attempting automated reproduction again. The bug report describes a real issue (fitted items not persisting), but we need runtime evidence to confirm it exists in the current codebase."
}
```

### Critical Finding

The test script **exists** (`reproduce_ship_fitting_persistence_bug.js`, 12705 bytes, created at 18:38) but **did not execute successfully**. The exit code 124 indicates a timeout, and critically:

- **NO evidence.json file was created**
- **NO console logs were captured** 
- **NO WebSocket command/response data was collected**
- **NO runtime state snapshots were taken**

This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** scenario, not a bug verification scenario. The test automation infrastructure failed before it could even attempt to reproduce the bug.

### Decision Rationale

According to the strict verification rules:

> "If ANY of these [evidence requirements] are missing → RETURN 'INCONCLUSIVE' immediately."

All 7 evidence requirements are missing. This is not even a case of "inconclusive due to unclear results" - this is **no results at all**.

The run_reproduction stage already correctly identified this as `FRAMEWORK_ERROR`, and that decision should stand.

---

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The test framework failed to execute properly and generated zero runtime evidence. Without WebSocket command logs, console output, or game state snapshots, there is no empirical data to verify whether the ship fitting persistence bug exists in the current codebase. The bug report describes a plausible issue, but the automated reproduction test timed out during initialization before it could capture any evidence. Manual testing would be required to verify this bug.
