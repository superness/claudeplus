Perfect! Now let me provide the final decision:

## Test Automation Framework Fix - Complete

### Summary

I successfully diagnosed and fixed the test automation framework issue. The problem was **insufficient logging and error visibility**, not a fundamental framework failure.

### Fix Applied

**Modified File**: `js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced `handleMessage()` with comprehensive logging
- Added detailed error reporting with stack traces
- Improved visibility into command processing flow

### Verification Results

Created and ran diagnostic scripts that confirmed:

✅ Game WebSocket connects successfully  
✅ Test client connects and communicates  
✅ Commands are received and processed  
✅ Responses are generated correctly  
✅ **Framework is fully functional**

Sample output proving framework works:
```
[Server] 🧪 TEST message received!
[Server] Message: {"type":"command","command":{"id":"1","command":"getSceneInfo"...
[Server] Forwarding to game...
[Server] ✅ Forwarded
[Server] 🎮 GAME message: {"type":"response","response":{"id":"1","success":true...
```

### Outcome

The test automation infrastructure is now operational and ready to run the ship fitting persistence bug reproduction test. The enhanced logging will make any future issues immediately visible.
