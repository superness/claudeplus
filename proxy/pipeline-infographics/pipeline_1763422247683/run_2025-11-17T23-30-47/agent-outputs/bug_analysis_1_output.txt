Perfect! Now I have enough information to complete the bug analysis. Let me provide the structured analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship fitted items are not persisting across page refreshes - items are lost when browser is reloaded",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a user fits items to their ship and refreshes the browser, the fitted items should remain equipped on the ship upon reload",
  "actualBehavior": "When the browser is refreshed, all fitted items are lost and the ship returns to its default empty state with no modules equipped",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship fitting", "persistence/save system", "localStorage", "game state serialization"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser (http://localhost:8080)",
    "Step 2: Dock at a station and open the Ship Fitting interface",
    "Step 3: Fit one or more items to your ship's slots (high/mid/low/rig)",
    "Step 4: Undock from the station (fitted items should be visible and working)",
    "Step 5: Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)",
    "Step 6: Observe that all fitted items are gone - ship has returned to default empty state"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/SaveGameManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The SaveGameManager.js file exists and has complete serialization/deserialization methods for ship fitting (serializeShipFitting at line 657 and deserializeShipFitting at line 714). However, there are likely TWO issues: 1) The saveGame() method is not being called when fitting items changes, so the fitted items never get saved to localStorage in the first place, and 2) The auto-save system may not be triggering frequently enough or the fitting system may not be marking the save state as 'dirty' when items are fitted/unfitted. The SaveGameManager has a markDirty() method but ShipFittingManager.fitItem() and unfitItem() methods are not calling it after fitting changes."
}
```
