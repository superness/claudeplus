I can see there's a mismatch. The GameTestingInterface's `fitItem` command doesn't match the ShipFittingManager's actual API. However, based on my analysis of the bug (fitted items not persisting), the core issue is that **there are NO automation commands to test ship fitting persistence**. 

I need commands that can:
1. Add an item to inventory (currently no such command exists in GameTestingInterface)
2. Fit an item properly with correct parameters (current fitItem doesn't work with ShipFittingManager's API)
3. Get the current fitted items from the ship
4. Trigger a save game operation
5. Reload the page and verify the fitted items are still there

Since the reproduction of this bug requires implementing new commands, I should report this:

**DECISION: need_command_implementation**

The bug reproduction script cannot be created because critical automation commands are missing from GameTestingInterface:

## Missing Commands Required for Ship Fitting Persistence Testing:

1. **`addItemToInventory`** - Add items to player inventory so they can be fitted
   - Current `addResource` only adds mining resources, not fittable items
   - Need: `addItemToInventory({itemId: 'mining_laser_i', quantity: 1})`

2. **`getFittedItems`** - Get all currently fitted items on the ship
   - Current `getShipState` includes `fittedModules` but `getFittedModules()` helper doesn't properly read from ShipFittingManager
   - Need to return actual fitted slots data from `shipFittingManager.getPlayerShipFitting().slots`

3. **`saveGame`** - Manually trigger save to localStorage
   - No way to trigger SaveGameManager.saveGame() via automation
   - Critical for testing persistence

4. **`reloadPage`** - Trigger page refresh within automation framework
   - Could be implemented as window.location.reload() wrapper
   - Needed to verify persistence across reloads

## API Mismatch Issues:

The current `fitItem` command in GameTestingInterface doesn't match ShipFittingManager's actual API:
- **Interface expects**: `fitItem({itemId, slot})`  
- **Manager requires**: `fitItem(shipId, itemId, slotType, slotIndex)`

This command needs to be fixed to properly call ShipFittingManager with correct parameters.

## Recommended Implementation Priority:

1. Fix `fitItem` command to use correct ShipFittingManager API
2. Add `addItemToInventory` command  
3. Fix `getFittedModules` to return actual fitted items from ShipFittingManager
4. Add `saveGame` command
5. Add `reloadPage` command (or test manually with external page refresh)

Once these commands exist, the reproduction script would be:
```javascript
1. Dock at station
2. addItemToInventory - Add a mining laser
3. fitItem - Fit the mining laser to high slot 0
4. getFittedItems - Verify it's fitted (should show mining_laser_i)
5. saveGame - Trigger save
6. reloadPage - Refresh browser
7. getFittedItems - Check if still fitted (BUG: returns empty/null)
```
