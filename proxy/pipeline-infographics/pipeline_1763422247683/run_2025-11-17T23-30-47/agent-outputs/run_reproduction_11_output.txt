Based on the execution output, I can see that:

1. **Environment Setup**: ✅ Completed successfully
   - HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled (`-c-1`)
   - Old Chrome processes killed
   
2. **Script Found**: ✅ `reproduce_ship_fitting_persistence_bug.js`

3. **Script Executed**: ✅ But failed early
   - Chrome launched successfully
   - Game connected to WebSocket
   - First command sent: "Find nearby station"
   - **Game disconnected immediately** after sending command
   
4. **Evidence Collection**: ❌ No evidence file created
   - Script exited before completing test sequence
   - No localStorage data captured

## Analysis

The test infrastructure encountered a **framework error**:

- **ChromeManager**: ✅ Working (launched Chrome, captured logs)
- **HTTP Server**: ✅ Working (no caching, serving files)
- **WebSocket Server**: ✅ Working (accepted connections)
- **Game Connection**: ⚠️ **FAILED** - disconnected after first command

The game's WebSocket connection was established but immediately closed after sending the first command. This suggests:
1. The game may not have the WebSocket automation framework properly loaded
2. The TestingBrowserBridge may be crashing on command execution
3. The game state may not be ready when commands are sent

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
