Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've created:

## Ship Fitting Persistence Bug Reproduction Script - COMPLETE

I've successfully created an automated reproduction script for the ship fitting persistence bug.

### What I Created

**1. Reproduction Script**: `reproduce_ship_fitting_persistence_bug.js`
   - **Two-phase test design**:
     - **Phase 1**: Fit items and save game
     - **Phase 2**: Reload page and verify persistence
   
**2. ChromeManager Enhancement**: Added `reloadPage()` method
   - Uses Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) over WebSocket
   - Connects to remote debugging port (9222)
   - Sends `Page.reload` command with cache clearing

### Test Flow

```
Phase 1: Before Reload
├─ Check initial state (docked or not)
├─ Dock at nearest station
├─ Add Mining Laser I to inventory
├─ Fit Mining Laser I to high slot 0
├─ Verify item is fitted
├─ Manually save game (saveGame command)
└─ RELOAD PAGE (using CDP)

Phase 2: After Reload
├─ Wait for game to initialize
├─ Check fitted items
└─ BUG REPRODUCED if item is missing
```

### Test Commands Used

```javascript
✅ dock                 - Dock at station (required to fit items)
✅ addItemToInventory   - Add Mining Laser I for testing
✅ getFittedItems       - Check what's currently fitted
✅ fitItem              - Fit Mining Laser I to high slot 0
✅ saveGame             - Manually trigger localStorage save
✅ RELOAD PAGE          - ChromeManager.reloadPage() via CDP
```

### Expected Outcomes

**BUG REPRODUCED**: 
- Phase 1: Item is fitted successfully
- Phase 2: After reload, item is NOT fitted (lost)
- Evidence file shows `status: "BUG_REPRODUCED"`

**BUG NOT REPRODUCED**: 
- Phase 1: Item is fitted successfully
- Phase 2: After reload, item IS STILL fitted (persisted)
- Evidence file shows `status: "BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED"`

### Evidence Collection

The script saves comprehensive evidence to `ship_fitting_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`:
- Fitted items before reload
- Fitted items after reload
- All command/response pairs
- Console logs from Chrome
- Error and exception counts
- Test summary with persistence status

### To Run

```bash
node reproduce_ship_fitting_persistence_bug.js
```

**DECISION: script_ready**
