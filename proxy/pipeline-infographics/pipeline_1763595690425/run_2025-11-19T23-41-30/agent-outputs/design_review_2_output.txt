ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ Clear understanding of the task - creating a daemon_pool_connector agent based on section 2.2 of the planning document
2. ✅ Logical step-by-step approach - starts with research (reading examples), then design, then implementation
3. ✅ Correct identification of all required components: RPC connection, authentication, network validation, monitoring
4. ✅ Properly maps the 4 decision outcomes required (connection_established, connection_failed, rpc_validated, error)
5. ✅ Considers appropriate error scenarios (network failures, auth failures, network mismatch)
6. ✅ Plans to use provided permissions appropriately (Glob for discovery, Read for examples, Write for output)

**Potential Issues:**
1. ⚠️ Step 1 uses Glob to find "existing agent examples" - this assumes agent examples exist in that directory. If none exist, the approach may need adjustment.
2. ⚠️ The plan doesn't specify HOW the RPC validation will be implemented in the JSON (will it be bash commands in prompts? state transitions? specific tools?). This could be clearer.
3. ⚠️ "Read 1-2 existing agent JSON files" - assumes there ARE existing files. If this is a new agent system, there may not be examples.

**Evidence Quality Analysis:**

The plan proposes these evidence items:
1. ✅ "Content of section 2.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md" - **STRONG** - This is concrete, verifiable, and directly proves understanding of requirements
2. ✅ "Example agent JSON structure from existing agents" - **STRONG IF EXISTS** - Verifiable by reading the files, but conditional on files existing
3. ✅ "The complete daemon_pool_connector.json file with all states, transitions, and validation logic" - **STRONG** - Concrete deliverable that can be inspected
4. ✅ "Confirmation that the file was written to the correct path" - **STRONG** - Verifiable via file system check
5. ✅ "Validation that all 4 required decision outcomes are mapped" - **STRONG** - Can be verified by inspecting the JSON structure

**Test Considerations:**
The plan includes robust testing scenarios covering failure modes, which is excellent for a production-quality agent.

**Confidence Rating:**
"Medium-High" is appropriately conservative given the dependency on unknown existing agent structure.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong** - The plan provides 5 concrete, verifiable evidence points that would definitively prove task completion. The evidence covers both the research phase (reading requirements and examples) and the delivery phase (complete JSON file with validated structure).

**Minor Recommendation:**
The plan could explicitly state what happens if no existing agent examples are found (fallback to creating schema from requirements alone), but this is a minor issue since the core task can still be completed from the section 2.2 requirements.

DECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)
