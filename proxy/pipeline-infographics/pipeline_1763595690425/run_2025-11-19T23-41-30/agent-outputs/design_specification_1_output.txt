UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the daemon_pool_connector agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will handle establishing and validating the connection between a cryptocurrency daemon and a mining pool via RPC, including authentication, network verification, and monitoring.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.2 specifications
2. Examine existing agent JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ to understand the required JSON structure and format
3. Design the agent with appropriate states, transitions, and RPC validation logic
4. Create the complete agent JSON configuration incorporating all requirements (RPC connection, authentication, network validation, monitoring)
5. Write the agent JSON to the specified location

STEPS:
1) Read /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ directory structure using Glob to find existing agent examples
2) Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md using Read tool to extract section 2.2 specifications
3) Read 1-2 existing agent JSON files using Read tool to understand the schema/structure
4) Design agent structure with:
   - Initial state for connection establishment
   - RPC validation states (getinfo, getblocktemplate tests)
   - Authentication validation
   - Network verification (regtest check)
   - Success/failure monitoring states
   - Appropriate state transitions based on RPC responses
5) Map the four decision outcomes: connection_established, connection_failed, rpc_validated, error to terminal states
6) Create prompts/instructions for each state that guide RPC testing using Bash commands (curl or similar RPC calls)
7) Write the complete JSON structure using Write tool to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will include states to handle RPC connection failures (network unreachable, refused connections)
- Will validate authentication failures (401/403 responses)
- Will verify network mismatch scenarios (mainnet vs regtest)
- Will test getinfo and getblocktemplate RPC calls independently with separate validation
- Will include error handling for malformed RPC responses
- Will ensure the agent can distinguish between different failure modes (auth vs network vs daemon down)
- Will validate that all required permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) are appropriately used

EVIDENCE:
- The content of section 2.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing exact requirements
- Example agent JSON structure from existing agents showing the correct schema
- The complete daemon_pool_connector.json file with all states, transitions, and validation logic
- Confirmation that the file was written to the correct path
- Validation that all 4 required decision outcomes are mapped to appropriate states

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires understanding the existing agent architecture pattern from the codebase and the specific requirements from section 2.2. The RPC validation logic is straightforward, but the exact JSON schema structure needs to be verified from existing examples. Once I examine the existing agents and the plan document, I can create a well-structured agent configuration.
