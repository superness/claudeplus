  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'critical bug' and describes broken/unrealistic behavior in the afterburner module. The symptoms indicate core physics integration issues: instant direction changes and instant speed changes that violate the EVE-style physics system. The user is reporting that existing functionality (afterburner module) is not working correctly - it's breaking the physics simulation rather than enhancing it properly.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The user reports a critical bug with the afterburner module: when an afterburner is fitted to the ship, the ship's movement physics become unrealistic and broken. Specifically: 1. The ship INSTANTLY changes its movement direction even though the ship model is still rotating (movement should follow the ship's orientation, not change instantaneously) 2. Throttle changes INSTANTLY affect the ship's actual speed (there should be acceleration/deceleration, not instant speed changes)",
