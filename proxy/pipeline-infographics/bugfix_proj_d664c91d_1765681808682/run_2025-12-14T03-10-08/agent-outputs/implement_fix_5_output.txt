Perfect! I've successfully added `transparent: true` and `opacity: 1.0` to all 31 MeshStandardMaterial instances in the Enemy.ts file. Now the death animations will be able to safely modify the opacity without causing Three.js to crash when trying to access undefined shader uniforms.

---

**Changes Made**:

File: `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/game/entities/Enemy.ts`
- Added `transparent: true` and `opacity: 1.0` to all 31 `MeshStandardMaterial` instantiations across all enemy faction models (Imperial, Tau, Ork, Tyranid, Chaos, and Generic fallback)
- Materials now include transparency support from initialization, ensuring Three.js compiles the shaders with proper uniform variables for opacity
- Initial opacity set to 1.0 ensures enemies render fully opaque until death animations begin

**Why This Fixes It**:
When `transparent: true` is set during material creation, Three.js compiles the WebGL shaders WITH transparency uniform variables (including `opacity.value`). This allows the death animation code at lines 1333 and 1370 to safely modify `material.opacity` without triggering the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')" error. Previously, materials were created without transparency support, so the shader uniforms for opacity were never initialized, causing the render loop to crash when the death animations tried to fade out enemies with THERMAL or PHOTON damage types.

**Testing Suggestion**:
1. Start the game and spawn enemies of different factions
2. Kill enemies with THERMAL damage (burns) and PHOTON damage (vaporize) - these are the damage types that trigger opacity animations
3. Verify the death animations play smoothly without Three.js console errors
4. Check that enemies appear normally before death (fully opaque at opacity: 1.0)
5. Monitor the browser console - you should no longer see the repeating "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')" error from `refreshUniformsCommon`
