  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'Critical bug' and describes non-functional ship movement - a core gameplay feature that is broken. The request describes systematic debugging steps and mentions that inputs are received but not producing expected behavior (ships remain stationary). This is a classic bug scenario where something that should work is not working.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Critical bug: Ship movement is completely non-functional. Navigation commands and tap-to-move inputs are not translating into actual ship movement on screen. The user reports that input events are being received but ships remain stationary. Investigate the entire movement pipeline: 1) Verify input event handlers are firing correctly, 2) Check that movement commands reach the ship entity system, 3) Examine position/velocity update logic, 4) Verify rendering reflects position changes, 5) Look for any errors suppressing movement updates. Fix all issues preventing ship movement and verify ships respond properly to both navigation commands and tap-to-move inputs.",
