  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user reports specific errors occurring in the ship fitting UI when double-clicking inventory items. Key indicators include: explicit mention of 'bug', specific error messages ('Cannot read properties of undefined'), exact file locations (StationUI.js:1605, QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715), and a broken feature (auto-fit not working). The request includes investigation, fixing, and testing steps typical of bug resolution.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "There is a bug in the ship fitting UI. When the user double-clicks an item in their inventory to auto-fit it, they get two errors: 1) 'Quantum Universe error: Script error.' at QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715, and 2) 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')' at StationUI.js:1605 in the autoFitItem function (called from line 1450). The error suggests that something is undefined when trying to access its 'hull' property during the auto-fit operation. Please investigate the autoFitItem function in StationUI.js, identify what object is undefined when accessing the 'hull' property, fix the bug to handle this case properly, create a reproduction script to verify the fix, and test that double-clicking inventory items to auto-fit them now works without errors.",
