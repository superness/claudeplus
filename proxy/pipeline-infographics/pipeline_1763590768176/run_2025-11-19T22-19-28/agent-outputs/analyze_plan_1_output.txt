UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to execute a meta-pipeline-builder-v2 system that will construct 18 mining cycle automation agents and 8 pipeline templates according to specifications in a document called MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This appears to be a complex automation system for a mining pool operation that needs to iterate through multiple stages sequentially.

APPROACH: 
1. First locate and read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand the specifications
2. Find the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 implementation or scripts
3. Examine the current pipeline structure to understand the sequential iteration mechanism
4. Identify all 18 agents and 8 templates that need to be built
5. Verify the execution order and dependencies between stages
6. Execute the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 system
7. Validate that all components are created correctly
8. Test the sequential iteration through all stages

STEPS:
1) Use `Read` tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand specifications
2) Use `Glob` tool with pattern "**/meta-pipeline-builder*" to locate the builder scripts
3) Use `Glob` tool with patterns like "**/pipeline*", "**/agent*", "**/automation*" to find existing pipeline infrastructure
4) Use `Read` tool to examine the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 implementation files
5) Use `Grep` tool to search for agent definitions and template specifications across the codebase
6) Use `Read` tool to examine configuration files in build/bin/Debug/config/ to understand the mining pool setup
7) Use `Bash` tool to execute the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 with appropriate parameters
8) Use `Grep` tool to verify all 18 agents were created (search for agent registration/initialization)
9) Use `Grep` tool to verify all 8 pipeline templates were created
10) Use `Read` tool to examine logs or output files from the pipeline execution
11) Use `Bash` tool to run validation/test scripts if they exist
12) Use `Grep` tool to check for any error messages or incomplete builds

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will verify that all 18 agents are created with correct configurations
- Will verify that all 8 pipeline templates are instantiated properly
- Will test that the sequential iteration progresses through all stages without skipping or repeating incorrectly
- Will check for proper error handling if any stage fails
- Will validate dependencies between stages are correctly resolved
- Will ensure the pipeline can handle edge cases like missing configuration or interrupted execution
- Will verify state persistence between pipeline stages
- Will test rollback or recovery mechanisms if they exist

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the specifications
- Will show the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 source code
- Will capture execution logs showing all 18 agents being built
- Will capture execution logs showing all 8 templates being created
- Will provide directory listings showing created agent files/modules
- Will show configuration files for each pipeline template
- Will demonstrate sequential stage progression through logs or status output
- Will provide test execution results validating the complete pipeline
- Will show git diff if new files were created during the build process

CONFIDENCE: Medium - This is a complex multi-stage automation system. While I can locate the documentation and execute the builder, there may be dependencies, environment requirements, or configuration needs that aren't immediately apparent. The actual execution success depends on whether the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 is complete and properly configured, and whether all prerequisites are in place. I'll need to discover the current state of implementation before executing.
