Perfect! I can see there's already a comprehensive reproduction script that exists. This script is well-designed and uses the available automation commands correctly, including `setNavigationTarget` which is exactly what's needed to test the ship movement bug.

Let me provide my analysis:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptStatus": "ALREADY EXISTS - Comprehensive reproduction script is ready",
  "scriptFeatures": [
    "✓ Uses setNavigationTarget command (available in GameTestingInterface.js:32)",
    "✓ Monitors ship position over 10 seconds with 1-second samples",
    "✓ Captures initial state, sets navigation target 5000m away, tracks movement",
    "✓ Includes console logging integration for browser logs",
    "✓ Detects bug if ship doesn't move (totalMovement < 1m and no velocity detected)",
    "✓ Saves comprehensive evidence.json with all ship states and console logs",
    "✓ Launches Chrome with testMode=true and remote debugging",
    "✓ Waits for game connection before starting test sequence"
  ],
  "commandSequence": [
    {"command": "listCommands", "purpose": "Verify automation framework is available"},
    {"command": "getShipState", "purpose": "Capture initial position/velocity"},
    {"command": "setNavigationTarget", "params": {"x": "initialX+5000", "y": "initialY", "z": "initialZ", "mode": "approach"}, "purpose": "Set navigation target 5000m away on X-axis"},
    {"command": "getShipState (repeated every 1s for 10s)", "purpose": "Monitor ship position/velocity over time"},
    {"command": "getShipState", "purpose": "Get final state for comparison"}
  ],
  "bugDetectionCriteria": {
    "bugReproduced": "totalMovement < 1.0m AND no velocity detected during 10s monitoring period",
    "expectedBehavior": "Ship should accelerate toward (initialX+5000, initialY, initialZ) with non-zero velocity",
    "actualBehaviorIfBug": "Ship remains at origin with zero velocity despite valid navigation command"
  },
  "evidenceFiles": [
    "ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json - Contains all commands, ship states, and console logs",
    "console_logs_[timestamp].log - Browser console logs from Chrome debugging (if available)"
  ],
  "executionInstructions": {
    "prerequisites": [
      "1. Ensure HTTP server is running: npm start (or npm run dev)",
      "2. Ensure WebSocket port 8765 is available",
      "3. Optional: Have chrome-console-logger.js available for browser logging"
    ],
    "runCommand": "node reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
    "expectedDuration": "~15-20 seconds for test sequence",
    "consoleOutput": "Detailed progress with real-time ship position/velocity monitoring table"
  },

  "validationStatus": {
    "usesOnlyAvailableCommands": true,
    "commandsVerified": [
      "listCommands ✓ (GameTestingInterface.js:49)",

    ],

  ],
  "recommendation": "The script at /mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js is complete, uses only available automation commands, and is ready to execute. No modifications needed."
}
```

**DECISION: script_ready**
