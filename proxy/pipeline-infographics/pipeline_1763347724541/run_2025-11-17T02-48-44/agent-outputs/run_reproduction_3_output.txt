Based on the execution facts observed, I can now provide the objective report:

## OBJECTIVE FACTS FROM EXECUTION:

**Infrastructure Status:**
- Dev server: RUNNING on port 8080
- WebSocket server: STARTED on port 8765
- Chrome browser: LAUNCHED with http://localhost:8080/index.html?testMode=true
- Chrome remote debugging: ACTIVE on port 9222
- Console logger: FAILED (missing URL parameter, exited code 1)

**Connection Status:**
- Test client → WebSocket server: CONNECTED
- Game client → WebSocket server: NOT CONNECTED

**Script Behavior:**
- Script stuck in loop printing "Cannot forward command: game client not connected"
- No automation commands executed
- No test sequence started
- No new evidence file generated
- Script did not complete after 45+ seconds

**Error Messages:**
- `[Logger Error] Usage: node chrome-console-logger.js <url> [duration_seconds]`
- `[Logger Error] Example: node chrome-console-logger.js http://localhost:8080 10`
- `[Logger] Exited with code 1`
- `Cannot forward command: game client not connected` (repeated continuously)

**Root Cause:**
The game browser is not connecting to the WebSocket automation server despite `testMode=true` being set in the URL. This indicates the `GameTestingInterface.js` or `TestingBrowserBridge.js` is not initializing the WebSocket connection when the game loads.
