Perfect! Now I have all the context I need to analyze this bug. Let me create a comprehensive bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands - ship remains stationary despite active navigation commands",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player sets a navigation target (via double-click, double-tap, or UI), the ship should automatically start moving toward that target at the configured speed setting (default 75%). The ship physics should receive thrust vector input and the ship position should update each frame.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains completely stationary even when navigation commands are active. Console logs show navigation target is set correctly with speedSetting=0.75, but the ship's position and velocity remain at zero. The navigation command flows through the system (InputManager → Ship.updateWithMiningAndExploration → Ship.updateWithNavigation → ShipPhysics.updatePhysics) but produces no movement.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "Navigation system (InputManager.getNavigationCommand)",
    "Ship movement (Ship.updateWithNavigation, Ship.calculateThrustFromNavigation)",
    "Physics engine (ShipPhysics.updatePhysics, ShipPhysics.updateTargetVelocity)",
    "Input handling (InputManager.setNavigationTarget)",
    "Mobile touch controls (MobileInputManager.handleDoubleTap)"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)",
    "Step 2: Wait for the game to fully load with the player ship visible",
    "Step 3: Double-click on empty space or an object in the game world",
    "Step 4: Observe that console shows navigation target set (e.g., '🎯 Navigation target set: approach to (X, Y, Z) at speed 0.75')",
    "Step 5: Observe that console shows navigation command active in simulator debug logs every 2 seconds",
    "Step 6: **BUG**: Ship remains at original position (0, 0, 0) - velocity stays at 0 m/s, position doesn't change",
    "Alternative Step 3 (Mobile): Double-tap on the screen on a touch device",
    "Alternative Step 3 (Keyboard): Press 'W' to increase thrust manually - this should also fail if navigation is the issue"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js (line 195-486: updateWithNavigation and calculateThrustFromNavigation)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js (line 69-163: updatePhysics, updateTargetVelocity, applyExponentialAcceleration)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js (line 676-713: getNavigationCommand, setNavigationTarget)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js (line 1752-1765: navigation command flow)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js (line 354-390: handleDoubleTap navigation integration)"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The thrustVector is being calculated correctly in Ship.updateWithNavigation() with a valid magnitude (e.g., 0.75 for 75% speed), but either: (1) The thrustVector.magnitude field is being lost/corrupted when passed to ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() due to object destructuring or spread operations, OR (2) The thrustInput is not being properly set in the physics object, OR (3) The targetVelocity calculation in ShipPhysics.updateTargetVelocity() is producing zero values despite valid thrust input. The extensive debug logging already in the code (lines 202-367 in Ship.js, lines 80-144 in ShipPhysics.js) suggests this bug has been investigated before with similar magnitude-loss issues (see BUGFIX comments at Ship.js:349-356 and ShipPhysics.js:71-88). The root cause is likely a JavaScript object handling issue where the 'magnitude' property is not being preserved through the call chain."
