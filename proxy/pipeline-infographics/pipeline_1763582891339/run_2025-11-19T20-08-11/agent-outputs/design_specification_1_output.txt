UNDERSTANDING: User wants a network_monitor agent JSON configuration that monitors Bitcoin network connectivity by checking peer count, block height sync status, and network latency. The agent should analyze network health and return one of three decisions: 'healthy', 'degraded', or 'disconnected'.

APPROACH: Create a JSON agent definition following the established agent system architecture. The agent will use Read/Grep to analyze Bitcoin daemon logs and Bash to run network diagnostic commands. I'll structure it with a comprehensive prompt that guides the agent through systematic network health checks and decision-making logic.

STEPS:
1. Read existing agent files (e.g., `agents/miner_manager.json`, `agents/daemon_pool_connector.json`) to understand the JSON structure and prompt patterns
2. Create `agents/network_monitor.json` with proper structure including name, description, role, permissions, and decisionOptions
3. Write detailed prompt that instructs the agent to:
   - Check Bitcoin daemon connectivity (RPC availability, process running)
   - Verify peer count (minimum threshold checks)
   - Check block height sync status (compare local height to network height)
   - Measure network latency (ping times, RPC response times)
   - Analyze patterns in log files for network-related errors
4. Define three decision options with clear criteria:
   - `healthy`: All metrics within normal ranges (peers >= threshold, sync current, latency acceptable)
   - `degraded`: Partial issues (low peer count, slow sync, high latency)
   - `disconnected`: Critical failures (no peers, daemon unreachable, no sync)
5. Include tool permissions: ["Read", "Grep", "Bash"]
6. Add comprehensive instructions for evidence collection (log excerpts, command outputs, metric values)

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: The agent design will handle various test scenarios:
- Fully connected network with good metrics → should return 'healthy'
- Partial connectivity issues (low peers or slow sync) → should return 'degraded'
- Complete network failure or daemon down → should return 'disconnected'
- Edge cases: initial blockchain download, temporary network blips, firewall issues
- Will instruct agent to check multiple data sources (logs, RPC commands, system diagnostics) to avoid false positives

EVIDENCE: Will provide:
- The complete `agents/network_monitor.json` file content
- Explanation of decision logic and threshold criteria
- Reference to existing agent patterns used as templates
- List of specific commands/log patterns the agent will use (e.g., `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo`, `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`, grep patterns for network errors)

CONFIDENCE: High - This follows established agent JSON patterns in the codebase. The task is clearly defined with specific tools (Read, Grep, Bash) and decision outcomes. Network monitoring is a standard operational task with well-defined metrics.
