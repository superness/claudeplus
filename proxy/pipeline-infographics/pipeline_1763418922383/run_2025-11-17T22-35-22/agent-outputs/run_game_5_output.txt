## Test Execution Complete

I've successfully executed the Radial HUD hover delay test suite and captured comprehensive evidence.

### Execution Summary

**Environment Setup:**
- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` flag (no caching)
- ✅ Old Chrome processes cleaned up
- ✅ Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`
- ✅ Chrome launched with debugging enabled on port 9222

**Test Execution:**
- **Script:** `test_hover_radial_hud.js`
- **Total Tests:** 6
- **Tests Passed:** 2 (33.3%)
- **Tests Failed:** 4 (66.7%)

**Evidence Captured:**
- **Evidence File:** `hover_hud_test_evidence_1763419435408.json`
- **Console Log File:** `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763419435408\chrome_debug.log` (156KB)
- **Console Logs Captured:** 1,999 entries
- **Console Errors:** 4 (non-critical - missing ship types)
- **Console Exceptions:** 0

### Test Results

**✅ PASSED:**
- **TC-003:** RadialHUD opens after 0.5s continuous hover (504.7ms ± 4.7ms - within tolerance)
- **TC-008:** Click bypass during hover (menu opens immediately on click)

**❌ FAILED:**
- **TC-001:** No instant open on brief hover - Menu opened after only 100ms instead of requiring 500ms
- **TC-002:** Progress indicator appears and updates - Progress stayed at 0% throughout hover (not animating)
- **TC-004:** Timer resets when hover interrupted - Menu opened even though hover was interrupted at 300ms
- **TC-005:** No HUD open when interrupted at 400ms - Menu opened despite interruption before 500ms threshold

### Bug Analysis

**Primary Issue:** `hoverProgress` property not being updated during hover timer
- Progress indicator is visible but stays at 0% throughout the entire hover
- Test captured 5 snapshots at 0ms, 100ms, 200ms, 300ms, 400ms - all showed 0% progress

**Secondary Issues:**
1. Menu opens immediately on `mouseenter` instead of waiting for 500ms timer completion
2. Timer interruption (`mouseleave`) not preventing menu from opening
3. Progress indicator visible but not animating

**Root Cause:** The hover timer is being started correctly (browser logs show "Hover timer started - holding for 500 ms"), but the timer callback that should update `hoverProgress` is either not being called or `hoverProgress` is not being set properly.

### Framework Status

✅ **Test Infrastructure: WORKING**
- HTTP server properly configured
- Chrome debugging working
- Console logs captured successfully
- Puppeteer automation executed all tests
- Evidence saved with complete data

❌ **Feature Implementation: BUGS DETECTED**
- Hover delay mechanism not enforcing 500ms requirement
- Progress indicator animation not working
- Timer interruption not canceling menu open

**Decision: execution_complete**

The test execution successfully captured all evidence needed for bug verification. The feature has critical implementation bugs that prevent the hover delay and progress indicator from working as intended.
