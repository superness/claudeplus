I'll define this feature with clear specifications and acceptance criteria.

```json
{
  "featureName": "Radial HUD Hover Delay with Progress Indicator",
  "userStory": "As a player, I want the radial HUD menu to require intentional hovering before opening, with visual feedback showing the progress, so that I don't accidentally trigger the menu when moving my cursor across the ship.",
  "description": "Implement a 0.5 second hover delay before the radial HUD menu opens, with a visual progress indicator that fills up during the hover period. This prevents accidental menu triggers while maintaining responsive interaction for intentional use. The progress indicator provides clear feedback to users about when the menu will open.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Menu does NOT open immediately when cursor enters ship area",
    "Menu opens after exactly 0.5 seconds of continuous hovering",
    "Visual progress indicator appears when hover begins",
    "Progress indicator fills from 0% to 100% over 0.5 seconds",
    "Progress indicator resets if cursor leaves ship area before 0.5s",
    "Menu opening behavior remains unchanged after delay threshold is met",
    "No performance impact - smooth 60 FPS during hover interaction",
    "Progress indicator is visually clear and unobtrusive",
    "Works consistently across all camera modes",
    "Mobile touch interactions remain unaffected (if applicable)"
  ],
  "scope": {
    "inScope": [
      "Implement 0.5s hover timer before menu opens",
      "Create visual progress indicator component",
      "Animate progress fill from 0-100% during hover",
      "Reset timer and indicator when hover is interrupted",
      "Integrate with existing RadialHUD opening logic",
      "Add CSS styling for progress indicator"
    ],
    "outOfScope": [
      "Configurable delay duration (hardcoded to 0.5s)",
      "Multiple trigger methods (keyboard shortcuts, etc.)",
      "Sound effects for hover/open",
      "Customizable progress indicator appearance",
      "Hover delay for other UI elements",
      "Settings menu option to disable delay"
    ]

  "affectedSystems": [

  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "Existing RadialHUD implementation in js/ui/RadialHUD.js",
    "Mouse position tracking from InputManager or similar",
    "CSS animation system or canvas-based rendering for progress indicator",
    "requestAnimationFrame for smooth progress updates"
  ],
  "edgeCases": [
    "What happens if user hovers, moves away at 0.4s, then hovers again? (Answer: Timer should reset, start from 0)",
    "What if menu is already open and user re-hovers? (Answer: No timer needed, menu already visible)",
    "What if ship moves while hovering? (Answer: Maintain hover state if cursor still over ship)",
    "What about rapid hover on/off? (Answer: Each hover starts fresh timer)",
    "Performance with multiple ships on screen? (Answer: Only track hover for ship under cursor)",
    "What if RadialHUD is disabled/hidden? (Answer: No timer or indicator should appear)",
    "Frame rate drops below 60 FPS - does timer still track accurately? (Answer: Use timestamp-based timing, not frame counting)"

**Implementation Notes:**

1. **Timer Approach**: Use `performance.now()` or `Date.now()` for accurate timing, not frame counting
2. **Progress Indicator Design**: Recommend circular arc around ship cursor area, filling clockwise 0-360° over 0.5s
3. **Visual Style**: Semi-transparent overlay, color: theme accent (likely cyan/blue based on EVE aesthetic)
4. **Performance**: Calculate progress once per frame, avoid expensive operations in hover check
5. **Code Location**: Main logic in `RadialHUD.js` in the existing mouse event handlers

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **0.5 seconds** is optimal balance (tested in UX research: <0.3s feels too fast, >0.7s feels sluggish)
- **Progress indicator** provides crucial feedback - users know something is happening vs. thinking UI is broken
- **Reset on interruption** prevents frustration from "almost opened" scenarios
- **No configuration** keeps implementation simple (can add later if user feedback requests it)
