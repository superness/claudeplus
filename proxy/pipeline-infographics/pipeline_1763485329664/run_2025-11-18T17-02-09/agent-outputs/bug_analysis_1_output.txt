Now I understand the complete issue. Here's my analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship fitting fails due to mismatched ship ID between StationUI and ShipFittingManager",
  "expectedBehavior": "When fitting items to a ship, the autoFitItem function should successfully find the ship fitting data and complete the fitting process",
  "actualBehavior": "autoFitItem throws 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' because getShipFitting returns undefined for ship ID 'player_ship_1'",
  "affectedSystems": ["UI", "inventory", "ship_fitting"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser",
    "Step 2: Dock at a station",
    "Step 3: Open station interface",
    "Step 4: Navigate to fitting service or inventory",
    "Step 5: Attempt to fit any item to ship",
    "Step 6: Observe TypeError in console at StationUI.js:1605"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/StationUI.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The root cause is a ship ID mismatch. StationUI uses 'player_ship_1' while ShipFittingManager registers the player ship as 'player'. When StationUI calls getShipFitting('player_ship_1'), it returns undefined because that ID doesn't exist in the shipFittings map. The code then tries to access fitting.hull without checking if fitting exists, causing the error."
}
