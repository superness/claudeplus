## Key Findings

### ❌ Bug NOT Reproduced
The ship fitting `hull` error could **not be reproduced** because:

1. **Environment Issue**: Game spawned with no stations within docking range (10km)
2. **Test Failure**: The `dock` command failed immediately with error: `"No stations within range (10km)"`
3. **Script Limitation**: The test script doesn't navigate to a station before attempting to dock
4. **Incomplete Test**: Ship fitting operations never executed, so the `autoFitItem` function at `StationUI.js:1605` was never called

### Console Logs Captured
✅ Console logs were successfully captured (5 errors found)
- However, **none** were related to the `hull` TypeError
- All errors were Chrome browser internals (GCM authentication failures)

### Framework Status
❌ **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** detected:
- Test scenario is broken - needs fix to navigate to station before docking
- Script crashed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'nearbyStations')` when parsing response

## Required Action

The reproduction script needs to be fixed to:
1. Properly parse `getSceneInfo` response (currently crashes on response handling)
2. Navigate to a nearby station BEFORE attempting to dock
3. Add distance checks and warp/approach commands if station is out of range
