Perfect! The framework error has been fixed. The `getSceneInfo` command now returns station positions along with `id`, `name`, and `distance`. This allows the test script to properly teleport the ship near a station before attempting to dock.

## Summary

**Framework Bug Fixed**: The `getSceneInfo` API was only returning `{id, name, distance}` for stations, but not the `position` property. This caused the test script to fail when trying to teleport the ship near a station for docking.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` line 1108-1117 to include the station `position` object in the `getNearbyObjects` response.

**What Changed**:
```javascript
// Before (missing position)
nearby.stations.push({
    id: station.id,
    name: station.name,
    distance: Math.round(distance)
});

// After (includes position)
nearby.stations.push({
    id: station.id,
    name: station.name,
    distance: Math.round(distance),
    position: {
        x: station.position.x,
        y: station.position.y,
        z: station.position.z
    }
});
```

The test script can now successfully:
1. Get station information including position from `getSceneInfo`
2. Teleport the ship near the station using `setPosition`
3. Successfully dock at the station
4. Proceed to test the ship fitting bug
