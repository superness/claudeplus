## Bug Reproduction Execution Report

### Execution Status: **COMPLETED**

### Environment Setup
✅ **All systems operational:**
- HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching DISABLED (`-c-1` flag)
- Old Chrome processes killed
- WebSocket port 8765 available
- Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`

### Reproduction Script
✅ **Script executed successfully:**
- **Script**: `test_ship_fitting_bug.js` (created Nov 18, 12:04)
- **Execution**: Completed with exit code 0
- **ChromeManager**: Properly integrated and functional

### Test Execution Results

**Infrastructure Status:**
- ✅ WebSocket server started on port 8765
- ✅ Chrome launched with correct flags
- ✅ Game client connected to WebSocket
- ✅ Test client connected to WebSocket
- ✅ Console logs captured successfully

**Test Failure:**
- ❌ **First command failed**: `dock`
- **Error**: "No stations within range (10km)"
- **Impact**: Test could not proceed to ship fitting stage

### Evidence Collection

**Evidence File:** `bug_evidence_1763485557918.json`
- ✅ Console log file captured: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`
- ✅ Console logs: 5 entries (Chrome GCM errors, not game errors)
- ✅ Total log lines: 28,340
- ❌ Ship fitting TypeError: **NOT FOUND**
- ❌ StationUI hull property errors: **NOT FOUND**

### Bug Reproduction Status

**Ship Fitting Bug:** ❌ **NOT REPRODUCED**
- The test did not reach the ship fitting stage
- No TypeError about 'hull' property was found in console logs
- No StationUI errors detected

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue:** Test environment configuration
- The reproduction script requires the player ship to be within docking range (10km) of a station
- No station was spawned or positioned near the player ship at test start
- This prevented the `dock` command from succeeding, blocking all subsequent fitting tests

**This is NOT a framework error** - the testing infrastructure worked correctly. The issue is test scenario setup.

### Recommendations

To successfully reproduce the ship fitting bug, the reproduction script needs to be updated with one of these approaches:

1. **Add station spawning**: Insert a `spawnStation` command before `dock`
2. **Teleport to station**: Use a `teleportToStation` or `navigateToStation` command
3. **Position ship near station**: Set initial ship position near existing station coordinates

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The test infrastructure worked correctly, but the test scenario setup prevented execution of the ship fitting operations. The reproduction script needs a station spawning or ship positioning step before attempting to dock.
