Perfect! So `fitItem` returns `{success: true, fitted: true, itemId: '...', itemName: '...', slotType: '...', slotIndex: ..., message: '...'}`.

So:
- Full response: `{success: true, data: {success: true, fitted: true, ...}}`
- Verify receives: `{success: true, fitted: true, ...}`
- My fixed verify checks `r.fitted` ✓

Great! All my fixes should be correct now. Let me create a summary of what I fixed:

## Summary of Test Framework Fixes

The test script had bugs in the verify functions where they were trying to access nested `.data` properties when the data was already unwrapped by `handleResponse`. 

**Fixed issues:**
1. `getSceneInfo` verify: Changed `r.data.nearbyStations` to `r.nearbyStations`
2. `getFittedItems` verify (first call): Changed `r.data?.high` to `r.high`
3. `fitItem` verify: Changed `r.success` to `r.fitted` and `r.data?.fitted` to `r.fitted`
4. `getFittedItems` verify (second call): Changed `r.data?.high` to `r.high`

The test script should now correctly parse responses and execute all commands in sequence without crashing.
