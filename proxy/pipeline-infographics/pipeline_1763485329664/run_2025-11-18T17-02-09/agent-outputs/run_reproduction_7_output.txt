The test couldn't reach the ship fitting step because it failed at the dock command. The station positioning logic in the test needs adjustment. Let me provide a final execution report:

}
```

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The test infrastructure has a logic error - the reproduction script teleports the ship to a hardcoded position (0, 0, 5000) which is too far from the nearest station (14906m). The dock command requires stations within 10km, so the test fails before reaching the ship fitting code that would reproduce the bug.

The test script needs to be fixed to:
1. Get the station position from `getSceneInfo` response
2. Teleport the ship to that station's actual coordinates (within 5km)
3. Then proceed with the dock and fitting commands
