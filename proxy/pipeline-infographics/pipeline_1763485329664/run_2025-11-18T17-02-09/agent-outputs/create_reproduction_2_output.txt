Perfect! I've created a comprehensive bug reproduction script for the ship fitting ID mismatch error. Here's what the script does:

## Test Scenario Overview

The script automates these steps to reproduce the bug:

1. **Dock at station** - Required for fitting operations
2. **Wait for UI initialization** - Allow station UI to load
3. **Get initial fitted items** - Baseline state before attempting to fit
4. **Fit mining laser** - Attempt to fit an item (this triggers the bug)
5. **Check console logs** - Look for the TypeError about undefined 'hull' property
6. **Verify final state** - Confirm item fitting state and double-check console errors

## Key Features

### Bug Detection Strategy
- The script monitors Chrome's console logs for the specific error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')` in `StationUI.js`
- Even if the `fitItem` command succeeds via the testing API, the bug may still occur in the StationUI autoFitItem function
- The test captures both command-level success/failure AND console-level errors

### Evidence Collection
- Full console log capture with error counting
- Command execution history with timestamps
- Initial and final fitted items state
- Automatic evidence file generation (`bug_evidence_<timestamp>.json`)

### ChromeManager Integration
- Uses the reference template with correct variable naming (`testClientServer` vs `testClient`)
- Automatic Chrome launch with cache disabled
- Console log parsing and analysis
- Clean process termination

## Expected Outcomes

### If Bug is Reproduced:
- Test will find the TypeError in console logs
- Status: `BUG_REPRODUCED`
- Evidence file will contain the error details

### If Bug is Fixed:
- No TypeError in console logs
- Item successfully fitted
- Status: `BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED`

The script is ready to execute and will provide definitive evidence of whether the ship ID mismatch bug exists in the current codebase.

**DECISION: script_ready**
