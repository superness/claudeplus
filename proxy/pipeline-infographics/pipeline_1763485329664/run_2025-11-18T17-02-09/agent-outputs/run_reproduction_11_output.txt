## Bug Reproduction Execution Report

### Execution Summary
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Result**: INCONCLUSIVE

### Environment Verification
✅ HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled (`-c-1`)  
✅ Old Chrome processes killed  
✅ Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`  
✅ WebSocket port 8765 available

### Script Execution
- **Script**: `test_ship_fitting_bug.js` (created today at 12:17)
- **Executed**: YES
- **Exit code**: 0
- **Evidence file**: `bug_evidence_1763486480756.json`

### Test Execution Details

The test successfully completed these steps:
1. ✅ Found nearby stations (6 stations detected)
2. ✅ Teleported ship near station (within docking range)
3. ✅ Docked at "Nexus Trade Center" (station_1)
4. ✅ Waited for station UI initialization

The test **failed** at step 5:
- ❌ `addItemToInventory` command failed
- **Error**: "Item not found in content database: mining_laser_i"
- **Reason**: Test used incorrect item ID (`mining_laser_i` instead of `basic_mining_laser`)

### Evidence Analysis

**Console Logs Captured**: 5 entries (all unrelated Chrome GCM errors)  
**Searched for ship fitting bug indicators**:
- ❌ No "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- ❌ No "reading 'hull'" errors  
- ❌ No "StationUI.js:1605" references
- ❌ No "autoFitItem" errors
- ❌ No TypeError entries

**Status in evidence**: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

### Root Cause
The reproduction script used an incorrect item ID. The test never reached the ship fitting code because it failed at the inventory addition step. Available item IDs in the content system are:
- `basic_mining_laser` ✅ (correct)
- `improved_mining_laser`
- `mining_laser_i` ❌ (incorrect - used in test)

### Framework Validation
✅ ChromeManager: Working correctly  
✅ Console log capture: Working (28,339 lines captured)  
✅ WebSocket communication: Working  
✅ Evidence collection: Working  
✅ Test infrastructure: Fully functional

### Conclusion
The ship fitting bug (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined reading 'hull' in StationUI.js:1605) was **NOT reproduced** because the test encountered a different error first. The test infrastructure is working correctly but needs to be updated with the correct item ID to proceed to the ship fitting step where the actual bug would manifest.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**
