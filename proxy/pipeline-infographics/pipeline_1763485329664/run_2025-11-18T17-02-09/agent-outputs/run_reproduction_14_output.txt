## Execution Complete

The bug reproduction test was executed but **encountered a framework error** before reaching the target bug.

### Environment Setup ✓
- ✅ HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled (`-c-1`)
- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed
- ✅ Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`

### Test Execution ✓
- ✅ Reproduction script found: `test_ship_fitting_bug.js`
- ✅ Script executed successfully (exit code: 0)
- ✅ Evidence collected: `bug_evidence_1763486759423.json`
- ✅ Console logs captured: 5 entries

### Test Results ⚠️

**Status**: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

The test completed 6 out of 10 steps before encountering a framework error:

**Completed Steps:**
1. ✓ Find nearby stations → Found "Nexus Trade Center" at 17km
2. ✓ Teleport near station → Positioned within docking range
3. ✓ Wait for position update
4. ✓ Dock at station → Successfully docked
5. ✓ Wait for station UI initialization

**Failed Step:**
6. ✗ **Add Mining Laser I** → `COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR`
   - Error: "Item not found in content database: mining_laser_i"
   - Location: `GameTestingInterface.js:515`

**Not Reached:**
7. ✗ Get fitted items
8. ✗ **Fit item** (this would have triggered the bug)
9. ✗ Wait for error
10. ✗ Verify state

### Root Cause

The `ContentManager` does not have the `mining_laser_i` item definition loaded, preventing the test from adding items to inventory. Without items to fit, the test cannot reach the `autoFitItem()` function where the `hull` property bug occurs.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix ContentManager**: Ensure ship modules are loaded in the content database
2. **Verify Item ID**: Check if the correct item ID is `mining_laser_i` or `Mining Laser I`
3. **Inspect GameTestingInterface**: Verify ContentManager initialization
4. **Alternative Approach**: Use a different item ID that exists in the database

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
