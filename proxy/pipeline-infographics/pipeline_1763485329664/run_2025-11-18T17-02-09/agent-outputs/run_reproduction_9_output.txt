I can see the issue - the test script is trying to get the station position from `getSceneInfo`, but the API response (line 18-21 in the evidence) shows that the `nearbyStations` array **doesn't include position data** - it only has `id`, `name`, and `distance`. That's why `station.position` is undefined, and the teleport failed.

This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** - the test script has a bug. The `getSceneInfo` command doesn't return station positions, only distances.

## Root Cause Analysis

The test script has a **critical bug**:

1. **Line 44 in test script**: Expects `station.position` from `getSceneInfo` response
2. **Evidence line 18-21**: `nearbyStations` only returns `{id, name, distance}` - **NO position data**
3. **Line 59-61**: When `evidence.stationPosition` is undefined, it defaults to `(0,0,0)`
4. **Line 213-224 in evidence**: Dock command fails because ship is 17km away from nearest station

The `getSceneInfo` API needs to be enhanced to return station positions, OR the test script needs to use a different method to find station positions (e.g., query the StationManager directly or use a `getStationPosition` command).

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
