## Framework Issue Fixed

I successfully fixed the test infrastructure issue that was preventing the reproduction test from reaching the actual bug.

### Root Cause

The test was using **incorrect item IDs** that didn't exist in the ContentManager database:
- Test used: `mining_laser_i`, `mining_laser_ii`
- ContentManager has: `basic_mining_laser`, `improved_mining_laser`

When `GameTestingInterface.addItemToInventory()` tried to add `mining_laser_i`, it failed with:
```
Item not found in content database: mining_laser_i
```

This prevented the test from reaching step 8 where `fitItem()` would trigger the actual bug.

### Changes Made

**File: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_ship_fitting_bug.js`**
- Line 102: Changed `itemId: 'mining_laser_i'` → `itemId: 'basic_mining_laser'`
- Line 124: Changed `itemId: 'mining_laser_i'` → `itemId: 'basic_mining_laser'`
- Line 164: Changed verification to check for `'basic_mining_laser'`

**File: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`**
- All instances of `mining_laser_i` → `basic_mining_laser`
- All instances of `mining_laser_ii` → `improved_mining_laser`

### Verification

Checked ContentManager item definitions:
- ✅ `basic_mining_laser` exists (line 255-282)
- ✅ `improved_mining_laser` exists (line 284-311)
- ✅ Both have correct `fitting` configuration with `slot: 'high'`
- ✅ Both are registered in the content database

### Expected Outcome

With these corrections:
1. Test will successfully add items to inventory (step 6)
2. Test will successfully retrieve fitted items (step 7)
3. Test will call `fitItem()` with valid item (step 8)
4. This **should trigger the actual bug** where `autoFitItem()` tries to read `hull` from undefined object

The test infrastructure is now fixed and should reach the actual bug location in `StationUI.js:1605`.
