Perfect! Now the test infrastructure has been fixed. Let me create a summary document explaining the fixes made:

## Test Infrastructure Fixes

### Issues Identified

1. **No station within docking range**: The original test tried to dock immediately without ensuring a station was nearby
2. **Missing item in inventory**: The test tried to fit an item without adding it to inventory first
3. **Incorrect item ID**: Used `'mining_laser'` instead of the correct `'mining_laser_i'`
4. **Response structure**: Didn't account for nested `.data` property in API responses

### Fixes Applied

1. **Station proximity setup** (lines 35-72):
   - Added `getSceneInfo` command to find nearby stations
   - Added `setNavigationTarget` to navigate toward origin
   - Added `setPosition` to teleport ship to 5km from origin (within docking range of default station)
   - Added wait time for position update

2. **Inventory setup** (lines 88-99):
   - Added `addItemToInventory` command to add Mining Laser I before attempting to fit it
   - Validates that item was successfully added before proceeding

3. **Correct item ID** (lines 91, 113, 153):
   - Changed from `'mining_laser'` to `'mining_laser_i'` to match actual item definitions in ContentManager

4. **Response data structure** (lines 95, 104, 120, 153):
   - Updated all response handlers to use `r.data` or `r.success` as appropriate
   - Added optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access nested properties

### Test Scenario Flow

The updated test now follows this sequence:
1. Find nearby stations (reconnaissance)
2. Navigate to origin where station spawns
3. Teleport ship near station (5km away)
4. Dock at station
5. Wait for station UI initialization
6. Add Mining Laser I to inventory
7. Get initial fitted items state
8. Fit Mining Laser I to high slot 0
9. Wait for any delayed errors
10. Get final fitted items state
11. Check console logs for TypeError

### Expected Outcome

The bug may or may not reproduce depending on whether the StationUI has the ship ID mismatch issue:
- **If bug exists**: Console logs will show `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')` from StationUI.js:1605
- **If bug is fixed**: Test will complete successfully with item fitted
