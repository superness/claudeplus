Perfect! Now I've fixed the critical integration issue. Let me create a summary of all the fixes applied:

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: SkillBar UI clicks completely bypassed combat system
- **File**: client/src/game/input/InputManager.ts:316-322
- **Fix**: Added public method `executeSkillByIndex()` to expose skill execution to UI components. This method routes UI skill clicks through the same combat validation pipeline as keyboard hotkeys.

### Issue 2: SkillBar had no connection to InputManager
- **File**: client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts:23, 40-46
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `InputManager` import
  - Added `inputManager` property to SkillBar class
  - Created `setInputManager()` method to accept InputManager reference

### Issue 3: SkillBar click handler called non-functional Player.useSkill()
- **File**: client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts:77-85
- **Fix**: Updated click handler to call `inputManager.executeSkillByIndex(index)` instead of `player.useSkill(index)`. This routes clicks through:
  - InputManager → CombatManager → Validation & Effects → Visual Feedback
  - Includes proper range checking, energy validation, cooldown management
  - Triggers all visual effects (projectiles, cones, error messages)

### Issue 4: Game.ts never wired SkillBar to InputManager
- **File**: client/src/game/Game.ts:217-221
- **Fix**: Added connection code after UI initialization to get SkillBar reference and call `setInputManager()`. This completes the integration chain so UI clicks now work the same as keyboard hotkeys.

**Result**: All visual feedback systems (projectile effects, cone effects, range indicators, skill error messages, buff indicators) are now properly triggered by both keyboard hotkeys AND UI clicks. The integration is complete.
