Let me create a comprehensive summary of my testing findings:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**PASS** (client TypeScript compilation)
**FAIL** (server tests - unrelated test file issues)

The client-side visual feedback code compiles without errors. Server test failures are due to outdated test files that don't match the current model structure - these are NOT related to the visual feedback implementation.

### Integration Path Verification

#### 1. **Skill Error Feedback System**

**Entry Point**: Server sends `ERROR` message via WebSocket
- ✅ Server generates detailed error messages with context (src/api/websocket/combat.handler.ts:649-669)
- ✅ NetworkManager receives and routes to error callback (src/network/NetworkManager.ts:337-342)
- ✅ Game.ts registers error handler (src/game/Game.ts:173-175)
- ✅ Game.handleNetworkError() parses errors (src/game/Game.ts:784-805)
- ✅ CombatFeedback.showSkillError() displays UI (src/ui/CombatFeedback.ts:579-593)

**Integration Status: ✅ CONNECTED**
Full path verified from server → NetworkManager → Game → UI

#### 2. **Buff/Debuff Display System**

**Entry Point**: Server sends `BUFF_EVENT` message via WebSocket
- ✅ Server broadcasts BUFF_EVENT with full metadata (src/api/websocket/combat.handler.ts:593-632)
- ✅ NetworkManager receives and routes to buffEvent callback (src/network/NetworkManager.ts:331-335, 405-406)
- ✅ Game.ts registers buff event handler (src/game/Game.ts:168-170)
- ✅ Game.handleBuffEvent() updates buff tracking (src/game/Game.ts:730-779)
- ✅ PartyUI.updateMemberBuffs() displays buffs (wired at Game.ts:771-774)

**Integration Status: ✅ CONNECTED**
Full path verified from server → NetworkManager → Game → PartyUI

#### 3. **Visual Effects for Skills**

**Entry Point**: Server sends `SKILL_RESULT` message via WebSocket
- ✅ Server sends skill results with target data (src/services/combat.service.ts:1065-1088)
- ✅ NetworkManager receives and routes to skillResult callback (src/network/NetworkManager.ts:325-329)
- ✅ Game.ts registers skill result handler (src/game/Game.ts:163-165)
- ✅ CombatManager.handleSkillResult() processes message (src/combat/CombatManager.ts:1192-1270)
- ✅ SkillEffectSystem renders visual effects (src/combat/SkillEffects.ts:88-200)

**Integration Status: ✅ CONNECTED**
Full path verified from server → NetworkManager → CombatManager → SkillEffectSystem

#### 4. **Range Indicators and Buff Indicators (3D)**

**Status: ⚠️ DISCONNECTED**
- ✅ RangeIndicators.ts exists (src/combat/RangeIndicators.ts)
- ✅ BuffIndicators.ts exists (src/combat/BuffIndicators.ts)  
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Neither class is imported or instantiated anywhere in the codebase
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No integration with Game.ts, CombatManager.ts, or UI.ts
- ❌ Range indicators never display for skills
- ❌ 3D buff indicators never appear on entities

**Integration Status: ❌ DISCONNECTED**
Classes exist but are never used. Visual feedback for range/3D buffs is completely missing.

#### 5. **DPS Meter**

**Status: ✅ INTENTIONALLY REMOVED**
- ProvingGrounds.showDPSMeter() is a no-op (src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts:937-939)
- Comments indicate DPS meter was removed per design requirements (line 826-829)
- DPS tracking still works internally for console logging
- User requested removal is already implemented

**Integration Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

### Disconnected Systems Found

1. **RangeIndicators.ts** - Completely unused
   - No imports in any file
   - Never instantiated
   - Skills show no range feedback

2. **BuffIndicators.ts** - Completely unused  
   - No imports in any file
   - Never instantiated
   - 3D buff visuals never appear (only 2D PartyUI icons work)

### Placeholder Code Found

None - all implemented code is functional where it's connected.

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURES:**

1. **Range Indicators Missing** (client/src/combat/RangeIndicators.ts)
   - Class exists with full implementation
   - ❌ Never imported by CombatManager, Game, or InputManager
   - ❌ Never instantiated or added to scene
   - **User Impact**: "I need more visualize feedback about if I am out of range" - NOT WORKING
   - **Fix Required**: Wire RangeIndicators into skill execution flow

2. **3D Buff Indicators Missing** (client/src/combat/BuffIndicators.ts)  
   - Class exists with full implementation
   - ❌ Never imported by any entity class (Player, Enemy, Companion)
   - ❌ Never instantiated or attached to entities
   - **User Impact**: "we need buffs displayed if they are happening" - ONLY WORKS IN 2D PARTY UI, NOT ON 3D MODELS
   - **Fix Required**: Attach BuffIndicator3D to Player/Enemy/Companion meshes

3. **Visual Effects for Cone/Ranged Skills Unclear**
   - SkillEffectSystem exists and is connected
   - ✅ Projectiles work (PROJECTILE effect type)
   - ✅ Beams work (BEAM effect type)
   - ⚠️ Cones may lack visual clarity (CONE effect type exists but needs testing)
   - **User Impact**: "it's not always clear what is happening especially for things like ranged attacks or cone abilities"
   - **Verification Needed**: Test cone skill visuals in-game

4. **Heroes/Henchmen UI Missing**
   - PartyUI exists and displays buffs
   - ⚠️ May not show full hero/henchmen information
   - **User Impact**: "I need UI for the heros\henchmen"
   - **Verification Needed**: Check what PartyUI displays
