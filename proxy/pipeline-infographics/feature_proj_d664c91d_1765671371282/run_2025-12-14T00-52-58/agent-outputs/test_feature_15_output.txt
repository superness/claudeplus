Perfect! Now I understand the issues. Let me create my integration test report:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**FAIL** - TypeScript compilation errors found:

1. **BuffIndicators.ts** - Invalid StatusEffectType values:
   - Line 45: `'CRIPPLED'` not in StatusEffectType enum (should be removed or mapped to valid type)
   - Line 46: `'BLINDED'` not in StatusEffectType enum (actual type is `'BLIND'`)
   - Line 48: `'SUPPRESSED'` not in StatusEffectType enum (should be `'SILENCE'`)
   - Line 49: `'ROOTED'` not in StatusEffectType enum (should be `'IMMOBILIZE'` or `'SLOW'`)
   - Line 83: Same invalid types in Record mapping

2. **Game.ts:771** - Missing method:
   - Calls `this.ui.getPartyUI()` but UI class doesn't have this method
   - UI.ts only has `getCombatFeedback()` method at line 270
   - PartyUI is never exposed through UI class

### Integration Path Verification

#### Path 1: Visual Effects for Ranged/Cone Attacks
**Entry Point**: `CombatManager.playSkillEffect()` → calls → `SkillEffectSystem.playSkillEffect()`
- ✅ CombatManager imports SkillEffectSystem at client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts
- ✅ Method exists and is called at lines 351, 416, 981, 1248
- ✅ ProjectileEffect class enhanced with larger size (0.35 units, glow sphere 0.5 units)
- ✅ ConeEffect class enhanced with 100 particles (doubled), size 0.6 (doubled), opacity 1.0
- **CONNECTED: YES** - Full path verified and enhanced

#### Path 2: Skill Error Feedback
**Entry Point**: Server sends ERROR message → `Game.handleNetworkError()` → `CombatFeedback.showSkillError()`
- ✅ NetworkManager registers error handler at Game.ts:173-174
- ✅ `handleNetworkError()` exists at Game.ts:784-804
- ✅ Calls `combatFeedback.showSkillError()` with error type
- ✅ `showSkillError()` exists at CombatFeedback.ts:579 with enhanced UI (24px font, icons, boxed display)
- **CONNECTED: YES** - Full path verified

#### Path 3: Buff/Debuff Display
**Entry Point**: Server sends BUFF_EVENT → `Game.handleBuffEvent()` → PartyUI update
- ✅ NetworkManager registers handler at Game.ts:168-170
- ✅ `handleBuffEvent()` exists at Game.ts:730-779
- ✅ Properly tracks buffs in `entityBuffs` Map (Game.ts:69)
- ❌ **DISCONNECTED**: Calls `this.ui.getPartyUI()` but method doesn't exist in UI class
- ✅ PartyUI.updateMemberBuffs() exists and is properly implemented at PartyUI.ts:519
- **CONNECTED: NO** - Integration path broken at UI layer

#### Path 4: DPS Meter Removal
**Entry Point**: `CombatDummy.createLabel()` 
- ✅ Label creation at ProvingGrounds.ts:622-646
- ✅ Line 638: Now displays `HP: ${this.maxHealth}` only (no DPS)
- **CONNECTED: YES** - DPS display successfully removed

### Disconnected Systems Found

1. **PartyUI not exposed through UI class**
   - PartyUI is instantiated somewhere but never connected to main UI
   - Game.ts assumes `ui.getPartyUI()` exists but it doesn't
   - Critical integration failure - buff system can't update party UI

### Placeholder Code Found

From grep results:
- `client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts:417` - Network interpolation placeholder
- `client/src/game/World.ts:339` - Placeholder gothic architecture
- `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:615` - TODO: Add initiative to PlayerStats
- `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:1286` - TODO: Add armor to PlayerStats
- `client/src/game/Game.ts:777` - TODO: Update BuffIndicator3D for enemies
- Multiple TODOs in PartyManager for threat/cleanse tracking

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURES:**

1. **PartyUI Not Integrated with UI Class**
   - **Impact**: Buff/debuff display completely non-functional
   - **Location**: Game.ts:771 calls `ui.getPartyUI()` which doesn't exist
   - **Fix Required**: Add PartyUI as property of UI class and expose via getter method
   - **Path Broken**: Buff tracking works, but can't reach PartyUI to display

2. **Invalid Status Effect Types in BuffIndicators.ts**
   - **Impact**: TypeScript compilation fails, breaks build
   - **Location**: Lines 45, 46, 48, 49, 83
   - **Fix Required**: Map to valid StatusEffectType enum values:
     - 'CRIPPLED' → Remove or map to 'SLOW'
     - 'BLINDED' → Change to 'BLIND'
     - 'SUPPRESSED' → Change to 'SILENCE'
     - 'ROOTED' → Change to 'IMMOBILIZE'

**MODERATE ISSUES:**

3. **StatusEffectType Mismatches**
   - PartyUI.ts uses similar invalid types in buff classification arrays
   - May cause runtime issues even if BuffIndicators is fixed

**WORKING INTEGRATIONS:**

✅ Visual effects enhanced and fully connected
✅ Skill error feedback enhanced and fully connected
✅ DPS meter removed successfully
✅ Buff tracking system works up to UI boundary
