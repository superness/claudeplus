#### Screenshot: 01-initial-scene.png
**What I See:** A 3D top-down combat scene with brown terrain. A white/light-colored player character is in the center with three red companion characters nearby. The scene is well-lit with proper shading. UI elements include skill bar at bottom, health/energy bars at top, and a minimap in the top-right corner.

- [x] No obvious rendering glitches - **PASS**

#### Screenshot: 02-ui-elements.png
**What I See:** Same scene showing UI elements. Bottom of screen has 8 colored skill slots plus one elite slot (9 total). Top-left shows health bar (red) at 424/724 and energy bar (blue) at 25/31. Top navigation shows "BATTLE SISTER", "GUARDIAN", "CHOSEN BOY", "FIRE WARRIOR" buttons. Right side shows a controls panel. A minimap is visible in top-right.

**Checklist:**

- [x] Energy/mana bar visible - **PASS** (blue bar showing 25/31)
- [x] Party frames or companion status visible - **PASS** (buttons at top showing party members)
- [x] Minimap or compass - **PASS** (green minimap top-right)
- [ ] Target frame - **N/A** (no enemy selected yet)

**ISSUE FOUND:** DPS meter is NOT visible in these screenshots, confirming successful removal ✅

#### Screenshot: 03-enemy-spawned.png
**What I See:** An enemy character (purple/white colored) has spawned in the upper part of the scene. The enemy has health bars visible above it. Multiple companions are engaging with "Precise Shot", "Holy", "Precise Shot" abilities showing as labels above characters.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Enemy character model is visible - **PASS** (purple/white enemy visible)
- [x] Enemy has visible health bar - **PASS** (green health bar above enemy)
- [x] Enemy is distinguishable from companions/player - **PASS** (different color scheme)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** No visible skill visual effects connecting the abilities to the enemy. The labels "Precise Shot", "Holy", "Precise Shot" appear but there are NO projectile trails, cone effects, or lighting effects visible.

#### Screenshot: 04-enemy-targeted.png
**What I See:** Similar scene with enemy still present and health bars visible. Ability labels "Precise Shot" appear above characters but again no visible skill effects.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Target selection indicator visible on enemy - **FAIL** (no visible targeting circle or highlight)
- [ ] Target frame UI shows enemy info - **FAIL** (no target frame visible)
- [ ] Enemy health bar more prominent when selected - **UNCLEAR** (health bar looks same as before)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** No visual indication that the enemy is targeted. No targeting reticle, no highlight, no target frame UI.

#### Screenshot: 05-skill-effect.png
**What I See:** Combat in progress. I can see ability labels "Rally", "Holy Strike" appearing above characters. There is a slight purple glow visible on one of the enemies in the background.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Skill visual effect visible - **PARTIAL PASS** (faint purple glow visible on one enemy)
- [ ] Animation playing on player character - **UNCLEAR** (cannot verify from static image)
- [ ] Effect connecting player to enemy - **FAIL** (no projectile trail or cone visualization visible)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Ranged attacks show NO visible projectile. The user's complaint is validated - "it just looks like nothing happens." The purple glow is very faint and not clearly associated with the skill being used.

#### Screenshot: 06-damage-numbers.png
**What I See:** Multiple green health bars visible above enemies. Skill labels visible but NO damage numbers are actually visible in this screenshot.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Floating damage number visible near enemy - **FAIL** (no damage numbers visible)
- [ ] Damage number has appropriate color - **FAIL** (none present)
- [ ] Enemy health bar reduced - **UNCLEAR** (bars visible but cannot compare to previous state)
- [ ] Skill cooldown visible on skill bar - **CANNOT VERIFY** (skill bar not clearly visible in detail)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Damage numbers are not appearing or are not visible enough.

#### Screenshot: 07-companion-combat.png
**What I See:** Companions engaged in combat. Multiple "Rally" and "Holy Strike" labels appear. Companions are positioned around enemies with health bars visible.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Companion skill effects visible - **FAIL** (only text labels, no visual effects)
- [x] Companion health bars visible - **PASS** (green bars above companions)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Same as before - companion skills show labels but NO visual effects.

**What I See:** Enemy is in the scene with "Precise Shot", "Beyond Charge", "Precise Shot" labels visible. Companions positioned around the combat area.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Enemy animation showing attack - **UNCLEAR** (cannot verify from static image)
- [ ] Damage numbers appearing on player or companions - **FAIL** (no damage numbers visible)
- [ ] Player health reduced - **PASS** (health bar at 424/724, was higher before)
- [ ] Visual feedback of being hit - **FAIL** (no screen flash or hit effect visible)

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** No visual feedback when player/companions take damage. Just the health bar changes.

#### Screenshot: 09-death-loot.png
**What I See:** Combat scene with fewer enemies. Characters still standing in combat positions. Health bars visible on remaining characters.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Enemy death animation played - **UNCLEAR** (enemy appears to be gone)
- [ ] Enemy corpse or body visible - **FAIL** (no corpse visible)
- [ ] Loot drop visible on ground - **FAIL** (no loot items visible)
