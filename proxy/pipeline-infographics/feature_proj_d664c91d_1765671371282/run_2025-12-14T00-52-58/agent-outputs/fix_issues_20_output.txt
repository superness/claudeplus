## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: BUFF_EVENT WebSocket Integration (CRITICAL)
- **File**: client/src/game/Game.ts:730-803
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote `handleBuffEvent()` to parse server message format correctly
  - Server sends: `{ type: 'BUFF_EVENT', data: { targetId, sourceId, action, effectType, effectName, duration, stacks } }`
  - Client now extracts `data` field and transforms field names (targetId → entity_id, action → event_type, etc.)
  - Added entity type inference from targetId prefixes (player_, companion_, enemy_)
  - Buff indicators now update in PartyUI when buffs are applied/removed
  - **Impact**: Buffs from server combat will now properly display on party UI and 3D indicators

### Issue 2: Visual Feedback for Out-of-Range and Out-of-Energy
- **File**: client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:324-347, 370-382
- **Fix**: Added `showSkillError()` method that displays prominent on-screen messages
  - Shows "Not Enough Energy: X required" in red when player lacks energy
  - Shows "On Cooldown: X.Xs remaining" in orange when skill is on cooldown
  - Shows "Out of Range" in gray when target is too far
  - Messages appear above skill bar with dark background for visibility
  - Applied to both targeted skills (handleSkillUse) and ground-targeted skills (executeGroundTargetedSkill)
- **File**: client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:1446-1474
- **Fix**: Added `showSkillError()` helper method with styled error div that auto-removes after 2 seconds
  - **Impact**: Players now get clear visual feedback when skills fail to activate

### Issue 3: Improved Skill Visual Effects (Ranged Attacks, Cone Abilities)
- **File**: client/src/combat/SkillEffects.ts:455-457
- **Fix**: Added point light to projectiles for dramatic lighting effect
  - Projectiles now emit dynamic light as they travel
  - Makes ranged attacks much more visible and impactful

- **File**: client/src/combat/SkillEffects.ts:568-617
- **Fix**: Enhanced cone effects with multiple visual elements
  - Added point light at muzzle flash (3 intensity, 15 unit range)
  - Added visible cone outline showing the area of effect
  - Cone edges drawn with bright lines matching skill color
  - All effects fade out after 300ms for clean visuals
  - **Impact**: Cone attacks like flamers now clearly show their direction and area

- **File**: client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:451-465
- **Fix**: Improved telegraph system to detect skill types
  - Detects cone skills by name (flame/cone)
  - Detects ranged skills by range > 5
  - Shows appropriate telegraph visualization for each type
  - **Impact**: Players see telegraphs before attacks fire, making combat more readable

### Issue 4: DPS Meter Removal
- **File**: client/src/game/Game.ts:592
- **Fix**: Removed call to `showDPSMeter()` and replaced with comment
  - DPS tracking still works in console logs
  - UI element removed for cleaner screen
  - **Impact**: No more DPS meter cluttering the UI

## Summary

All visual feedback issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Buffs/debuffs now properly display from WebSocket combat events
- ✅ Clear error messages when skills fail (range/energy/cooldown)
- ✅ Enhanced projectile effects with lighting
- ✅ Cone abilities have visible area indicators
- ✅ Telegraph system shows attack areas before they fire
- ✅ DPS meter removed from UI

The build compiles successfully with all TypeScript errors resolved.
