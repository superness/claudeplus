### Summary

**Functional Tests**: 11/24 passed (46% pass rate)
- Combat tests: 7/12 passed (5 timeout failures)
- Skill error feedback: 4/4 passed (100%)
- Visual validation: 6/8 passed (2 failures)

**Visual Checks**: 24/47 checklist items passed (51% pass rate)

**Critical Visual Issues Found**:

1. **❌ FLOATING DAMAGE NUMBERS NOT RENDERING** - Code exists but visuals not appearing
2. **❌ PARTY UI/BUFF DISPLAYS MISSING** - No party frames visible for companions
3. **⚠️ SKILL VISUAL EFFECTS WEAK** - Minimal projectile/beam effects (labels appear but limited particles)
4. **❌ RANGE INDICATORS NOT VISIBLE** - Cannot see range circles or out-of-range feedback
5. **❌ TARGET SELECTION UNCLEAR** - No target frame or selection highlight visible
6. **❌ CONE/AOE EFFECTS NOT VISIBLE** - No cone visualization for area attacks

**What IS Working**:
- ✅ 3D scene renders properly
- ✅ Player and companions visible
- ✅ Enemy models render
- ✅ Health/energy bars visible
- ✅ Skill bar present
- ✅ Combat log records events
- ✅ Some particle effects (purple particles seen in screenshot 05)
- ✅ NO DPS METER (user request satisfied)
- ✅ Skill error feedback tests pass (though not captured visually)

**Root Problem**: Despite integration being "fully connected" according to code analysis, the **visual rendering is NOT working** for many key features:
- Damage numbers render system exists but numbers don't appear
- Party UI system exists but frames don't render
- Range indicator system exists but circles don't show
- Skill effect system exists but most effects are invisible

This suggests:
- Possible Z-index/layering issues (UI elements behind 3D scene)
- CSS display/visibility problems
- Three.js rendering order issues
- Canvas/WebGL context conflicts
- DOM element positioning problems
