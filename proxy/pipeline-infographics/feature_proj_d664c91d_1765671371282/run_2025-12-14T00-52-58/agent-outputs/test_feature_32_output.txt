Perfect! I now have the complete picture. The issue is clear: **SkillBar UI clicks bypass the combat manager entirely**. Let me compile the test results:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
✅ **PASS** - TypeScript compilation successful, no errors

### Integration Path Verification

#### Path 1: Keyboard Hotkeys (1-8, 0) - **CONNECTED ✅**
- **Entry point**: `InputManager.handleKeyDown()` (line 119)
- **Calls**: `InputManager.executeSkill()` (line 320)
- **Reaches target**: `CombatManager.executeSkill()` (line 330)
- **Visual feedback**: Yes - `showSkillError()` called on validation failures (CombatManager.ts:328-340)
- **Effects system**: Yes - `SkillEffects.playSkillEffect()` called (CombatManager.ts:475)
- **Status**: **WORKING** - Full path connected with all visual feedback systems

#### Path 2: SkillBar UI Clicks - **DISCONNECTED ❌**
- **Entry point**: `SkillBar` click handler (SkillBar.ts:62)
- **Calls**: `player.useSkill(index)` (SkillBar.ts:67)
- **Reaches target**: **NO** - Player.useSkill() is a no-op (Player.ts:292-304)
- **Comments in code**: "Don't check cooldowns or deduct energy here! The CombatManager handles all skill validation"
- **Status**: **BROKEN** - Clicking skills in UI does nothing!

### Disconnected Systems Found

1. **CRITICAL: SkillBar UI completely bypasses combat system**
   - SkillBar.ts:67 calls `player.useSkill()` which does nothing
   - Should call `inputManager.executeSkill()` or expose a method to trigger skills through CombatManager
   - User clicks on skill icons → nothing happens

### Visual Feedback Systems Status

✅ **Projectile Effects**: Implemented (ProjectileEffect class, CombatManager.ts:475)
✅ **Cone Effects**: Implemented (ConeEffect class with 1.0s duration, SkillEffects.ts:539)
✅ **Range Indicators**: Implemented (RangeIndicatorSystem initialized CombatManager.ts:130)
✅ **Skill Error Messages**: Implemented (showSkillError() with colored messages, CombatManager.ts:1454)
✅ **Buff 3D Indicators**: Implemented (updatePlayerBuffIndicators, CombatManager.ts:1407)
✅ **Party UI Buffs**: Implemented (PartyUI.updateMemberBuffs, PartyUI.ts:534)
✅ **DPS Meter Removed**: Confirmed (ProvingGrounds.ts:826-946 - replaced with no-op stubs)
✅ **Ground Targeting**: Implemented (GroundTargetingSystem initialized with camera, Game.ts:209)

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURE**:
1. **SkillBar UI clicks don't work** - The UI skill bar click handler (SkillBar.ts:62-69) calls `player.useSkill()` which is a stub that does nothing. Only keyboard hotkeys (1-8, 0) work because they route through `InputManager.executeSkill()` → `CombatManager.executeSkill()`

**Root Cause**: SkillBar was never connected to the InputManager or CombatManager. It directly calls Player.useSkill() which was intentionally made into a no-op with a comment saying CombatManager should handle validation.

**Impact**: 
- All visual effects systems are properly implemented
- Range validation, energy checks, cooldowns all work
- Visual effects (projectiles, cones, buffs) all work
- **BUT** only when triggered via keyboard - UI clicks are completely non-functional

**Required Fix**: SkillBar needs to be wired to either:
- Option A: Call `InputManager.executeSkill()` 
- Option B: Call `CombatManager.executeSkill()` directly
- Option C: Expose a public method on InputManager that SkillBar can call
