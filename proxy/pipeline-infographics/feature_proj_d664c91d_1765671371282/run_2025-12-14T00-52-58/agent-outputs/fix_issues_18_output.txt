Excellent! All fixes have been applied. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Range Indicators Missing (client/src/combat/RangeIndicators.ts)
- **File**: client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts
- **Fix**: 
  - Imported RangeIndicatorSystem and RangeIndicatorUI
  - Added rangeIndicator and rangeIndicatorUI properties to CombatManager
  - Initialized range indicators in init() method
  - Added range circle display when targeting enemies showing green (in range), orange (warning - near max range), or grey (out of range)
  - Added UI range indicator that appears when out of range
  - Added telegraph indicators for cone, AoE, and ranged attacks showing visual feedback before skills execute

### Issue 2: 3D Buff Indicators Missing (client/src/combat/BuffIndicators.ts)
- **Files**: 
  - client/src/game/entities/Player.ts
  - client/src/game/entities/Enemy.ts
  - client/src/game/companions/Companion.ts
  - client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts
- **Fix**:
  - Imported BuffIndicator3D and BuffData types into all entity classes
  - Added buffIndicator property to Player, Enemy, and Companion classes
  - Initialized BuffIndicator3D in each entity's init() method
  - Added updateBuffIndicators() method to all three entity classes
  - Connected buff updates in CombatManager:
    - Added updatePlayerBuffIndicators() helper method
    - Added updateEnemyBuffIndicators() helper method
    - Called these methods whenever status effects are applied or removed
  - Buff indicators now display above entities showing:
    - Buff/debuff type (color-coded: green for buffs, red for debuffs, orange for control)
    - Duration ring that shrinks as time passes
    - Stack count for stackable effects
    - Max 3 buffs displayed per entity

### Issue 3: Cone/Ranged Skill Visual Effects Unclear
- **File**: client/src/combat/SkillEffects.ts
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced ConeEffect with muzzle flash at source position for immediate visual feedback
  - Increased particle count from 100 to 150 for denser cone spray
  - Added bright glowing sphere at source that fades out quickly (200ms)
  - Telegraph indicators (from Issue 1 fix) now show cone shape on ground before skill fires

### Issue 4: DPS Meter Needs Removal
- **File**: client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts
- **Fix**: Already implemented - showDPSMeter() is a no-op that logs to console. DPS tracking still works internally for debugging but UI display was removed per design requirements.

### Issue 5: Heroes/Henchmen UI Enhancement
- **File**: client/src/ui/PartyUI.ts
- **Fix**:
  - Added "(Hero)" or "(Henchman)" label next to companion names
  - Added numeric health/energy values displayed on bars (e.g., "450/735")
  - Increased bar height from 6px to 14px to accommodate text
  - Added tooltips showing exact health/energy values on hover
  - Bars now show current/max values making it clearer when companions need healing

## Summary

All visual feedback issues have been addressed:
1. ✅ Range indicators now show when you're in range, at max range, or out of range with color-coded circles and UI feedback
2. ✅ Buffs and debuffs now display as 3D indicators above all entities (player, enemies, companions) with duration rings and stack counts
3. ✅ Cone and ranged attacks now have clear visual telegraphs and enhanced particle effects with muzzle flashes
4. ✅ DPS meter confirmed removed (was already done)
5. ✅ Party UI now clearly distinguishes heroes from henchmen and shows detailed health/energy values
