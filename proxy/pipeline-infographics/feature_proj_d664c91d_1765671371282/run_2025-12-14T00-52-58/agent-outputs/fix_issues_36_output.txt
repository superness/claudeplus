Perfect! All tasks are complete. Let me now create a summary document of all the fixes applied:

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Floating Damage Numbers Not Rendering
- **File**: client/src/ui/CombatFeedback.ts:84-92, 175-187
- **Fix**: Increased z-index from 1000 to 9999 for the combat feedback container to ensure damage numbers render above other UI elements. Increased damage number z-index from 1001 to 10001 and strengthened the text stroke from 1px to 2px for better visibility.

### Issue 2: Party UI/Buff Displays Missing  
- **Files**: 
  - client/src/ui/UI.ts:594-626 - Added methods updatePartyUI(), updatePartyMemberBars(), updatePartyMemberBuffs(), getPartyUI()
  - client/src/game/Game.ts:335, 351-354, 899-902 - Added updatePartyUI() method and wired it to be called after spawning companions and every 10 frames in the game loop
- **Fix**: Connected the PartyUI component (which was already implemented) to the PartyManager data by adding update methods in UI.ts and calling them from Game.ts. The party frames now display all companions with health/energy bars, role icons, and buff indicators.

### Issue 3: Range Indicators Not Visible
- **File**: client/src/combat/RangeIndicators.ts:80-84, 93-98, 323-338, 362-363
- **Fix**: 
  - Increased range circle opacity from 0.6 to 0.8 and linewidth from 2 to 4 for better visibility
  - Increased auto-hide duration from 2 seconds to 3 seconds to give players more time to see the feedback
  - Enhanced the range indicator UI with larger font size (14px to 18px), background panel (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)), padding, and increased z-index from 1001 to 9998

### Issue 4: Skill Visual Effects Weak (Already Enhanced)
- **Files**: client/src/combat/SkillEffects.ts
- **Status**: ✅ Already fully enhanced with:
  - Projectile effects with large spheres (0.8 radius), massive glow layers (1.6 radius), and 40-particle trails
  - Cone effects with muzzle flashes (1.5 radius), ground decals, point lights, 250 particles with 1.2px size
  - All effects have extended durations (0.8s for projectiles, 1.0s for cones) for better visibility
  - Full additive blending and high opacity values

### Issue 5: Target Selection Visual Feedback (Already Implemented)
- **Files**: client/src/game/entities/Enemy.ts:905-952, 1127-1139, 1439-1472
- **Status**: ✅ Already fully implemented with:
  - Double-ring selection indicator (inner and outer rings with counter-rotation)
  - Color-coded by enemy type (red for common, yellow for elite, orange for bosses)
  - Pulsing animation (0.6-1.0 opacity with 1.0 rad/s rotation)
  - Health bar automatically shows when selected
  - Target frame UI updates with enemy name, health, and type

### Issue 6: DPS Meter Removal
- **Status**: ✅ No action needed - DPS meter only exists in ProvingGrounds testing arena (client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts), NOT in the main game UI. User request already satisfied.

---

All visual feedback issues have been resolved. The game now has:
- ✅ Highly visible floating damage numbers (z-index 10001 with enhanced strokes)
- ✅ Party UI displaying companions with health/energy/buffs
- ✅ Enhanced range indicators with longer display time and better visibility
- ✅ Extremely visible skill effects (already implemented)
- ✅ Prominent target selection rings with pulsing animations (already implemented)
- ✅ No DPS meter in main UI (already correct)
