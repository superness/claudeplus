Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me create my analysis:

## Next Feature: Enhanced Combat Visual Feedback System

### Already Implemented

**Visual Effects System** (client/src/combat/SkillEffects.ts):
- Basic particle effects for skills (melee, projectile, cone, explosion, heal, buff, aura)
- Color-coded damage types (kinetic, piercing, explosive, thermal, warp, photon)
- Effect classes for different skill types
- Particle pooling system

**Combat Feedback UI** (client/src/ui/CombatFeedback.ts):
- Floating damage numbers with size scaling
- Healing numbers
- Status effect text
- Miss/dodge/block indicators
- XP and loot pickup notifications
- Skill activation text (center screen)

**Combat Validation** (client/src/combat/CombatValidation.ts):
- Error types defined: OUT_OF_RANGE, NOT_ENOUGH_ENERGY, ON_COOLDOWN, etc.
- Error messages defined but NOT displayed to player visually

**Skill Bar** (client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts):
- Circular cooldown overlays
- Level-based slot locking
- Tooltips on hover

**Party UI** (client/src/ui/PartyUI.ts):
- Basic health/energy bars for companions
- Role indicators
- Hero vs Henchman styling
- Stance buttons
- NO buff/debuff indicators displayed

**DPS Meter** (client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts:857-911):
- DPSMeterUI class showing 5s/30s/60s averages
- Total damage counter
- Fixed position display

### From Design Docs

Based on user request, the game needs:
1. **Better ranged attack/cone ability visual clarity** - Current projectile/cone effects exist but may be too subtle
2. **Range/energy failure feedback** - Validation errors exist but not visually communicated to player
3. **Buff/debuff status display** - Combat system tracks conditions but no UI shows active buffs
4. **Hero/Henchmen companion UI** - PartyUI exists but lacks buff indicators
5. **Remove DPS meter** - User explicitly wants this gone

### Why This Feature Next

This is a **CRITICAL FEEDBACK POLISH** feature that directly impacts player experience. The user is experiencing confusion during combat:
- "it just looks like nothing happens" - Visual effects need enhancement
- "maybe sometimes enemies take damage" - Lack of clear feedback
- "out of range or out of energy or something" - No error feedback shown to player
- "we need buffs displayed" - Game tracks buffs but doesn't show them
- "I need UI for the heroes\henchmen" - Companion buffs not visible
- "dps meter to go away" - Explicit removal request

This is a **polish and feedback** issue, not a core mechanic issue. The game has all the data and systems - it just needs to communicate them to the player visually.
