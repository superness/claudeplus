Perfect! Now let me create a summary document showing what was implemented:

## Implemented

All visual feedback and UI improvements specified in the reviewed requirements have been implemented:

1. **DPS Meter Removal** - Removed the DPS meter UI from ProvingGrounds.ts as requested
2. **Error Feedback Messages** - Added skill error system with 5 error types (cooldown, energy, range, target, interrupt) with exact colors from design docs
3. **Range Validation System** - Complete range indicator system with green/orange/grey indicators, visual circles, and telegraphs for ground/cone attacks
4. **Buff/Debuff Visual Indicators** - Comprehensive buff system with duration rings, stack counts, and 3D + UI implementations
5. **Enhanced Projectile Effects** - Projectile system already had proper trajectories with arc motion and trailing particles
6. **Enhanced Cone Effects** - Cone effect system already had proper 60-degree spread with particle visualization
7. **Low Energy Warning** - Added pulsing energy bar and warning text at <20% energy threshold
8. **Expanded Party UI** - Enhanced party frames with buff indicators (max 3 per visual-combat-design.md:1313)

## Design Compliance

### Requirement: Remove DPS Meter UI
**Implementation**: Removed DPSMeterUI class entirely from client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts:857-911, replaced with stub methods that log to console. DPS tracking still available internally but no longer displayed.

### Requirement: Error Feedback Messages (visual-combat-design.md:513-518)
**Implementation**: Added `showSkillError()` method to CombatFeedback.ts with exact error types and colors:
- COOLDOWN: "Skill is recharging" (#c43c3c - red)
- ENERGY: "Not enough energy" (#3a8ac4 - blue)
- RANGE: "Target out of range" (#ff8844 - orange)
- TARGET: "Invalid target" (#888888 - grey)
- INTERRUPT: "Interrupted!" (#ff4444 - bright red)

### Requirement: Range Validation System (testing-arena-design.md:273-277)
**Implementation**: Created client/src/combat/RangeIndicators.ts with:
- Green indicator: Target in comfortable range (≤90% max)
- Orange indicator: Near max range warning (90-100%)
- Grey indicator: Out of range (>100%)
- Visual range circles with auto-hide (2s)
- Test mode toggle for persistent circles
- Ground telegraph system for AoE skills
- Cone telegraph system for cone attacks (60° default)
- Distance display in UI

### Requirement: Buff/Debuff Display (visual-combat-design.md:175-178, 1280, 1313)
**Implementation**: Created client/src/combat/BuffIndicators.ts with:
- **Colors**: Green (#44ff44) for buffs, Red (#ff4444) for debuffs, Orange (#ffaa44) for control
- **Duration Indicator**: Shrinking ring visual (counter-clockwise sweep)
- **Stack Count**: Displayed in corner badge for stacks > 1
- **Position**: Below health bar (3D) and in party frames (UI)
- **Max 3 Conditions**: Limited to 3 buffs per entity as per design doc
- **Two Implementations**: BuffIndicator3D for 3D world, BuffIndicatorUI for party frames

### Requirement: Projectile Visual Effects (visual-combat-design.md:145-163)
**Implementation**: Existing ProjectileEffect class in SkillEffects.ts already implements:
- Spherical projectile mesh with primary color
- Arc trajectory with sine wave motion
- Trailing particle system with secondary color
- Proper speed and duration (0.3s default)
- Continues past target on miss as specified

### Requirement: Cone Effect Visuals (visual-combat-design.md:152-163)
**Implementation**: Existing ConeEffect class in SkillEffects.ts already implements:
- 60-degree cone spread (π/3 radians)
- 50 particles with velocity spread
- Two-color gradient (primary/secondary)
- Additive blending for proper visual effect
- Enhanced with cone telegraph in RangeIndicators.ts showing exact angle and range

### Requirement: Skill Bar Low Energy Warning (visual-combat-design.md)
**Implementation**: Added to client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts:
- CSS animation `lowEnergyPulse` (1.5s cycle)
- Applied to energy bar when <20%
- Warning text "LOW ENERGY" displayed above skill bar
- Pulsing glow effect on energy bar (rgba(58, 138, 196, 0.3-0.6))
- Auto-removes when energy >20%
- New method: `updateEnergy(current, max)`

### Requirement: Party/Companion UI (visual-combat-design.md:1305-1329)
**Implementation**: Enhanced client/src/ui/PartyUI.ts with:
- **Buff Indicators**: Max 3 buffs shown per member (design doc:1313)
- **Buff Icons**: 16x16px with 3-letter abbreviations
- **Color Coding**: Green border for buffs, red for debuffs, orange for control
- **Stack Display**: Small badge showing stack count for stacks > 1
- **Layout**: Buffs displayed below health/energy bars
- **New Method**: `updateMemberBuffs(memberId, buffs)`

### Requirement: Damage Type Colors (visual-combat-design.md:194-287)
**Implementation**: Already correctly implemented in SkillEffects.ts and CombatFeedback.ts:
- KINETIC: #888888 (grey/metal)
- PIERCING: #4a90d9 (blue/steel)
- EXPLOSIVE: #ff6600 (orange/red)
- RENDING: #cc0000 (deep red)
- THERMAL: #ff4400 (fire orange)
- ELECTRIC: #00ccff (cyan)
- WARP: #9932cc (purple)
- PHOTON: #ffd700 (gold)

### Requirement: Performance Targets (visual-combat-design.md:1338-1373)
**Implementation**: Existing particle system in SkillEffects.ts uses:
- Object pooling (50-object pool)
- Limited particle counts (30-100 per effect)
- Auto-cleanup after effect completion
- Additive blending for performance
- No draw call optimization needed for client-only implementation

## How to Test

### Error Feedback
1. Try using a skill on cooldown → See "Skill is recharging" in red
2. Try using a skill with insufficient energy → See "Not enough energy" in blue
3. Try using a skill on target out of range → See "Target out of range" in orange
4. Try using a skill with no valid target → See "Invalid target" in grey

### Range Indicators
1. Target an enemy and use a ranged skill:
   - Within 90% range: Green circle appears
   - Between 90-100%: Orange circle (warning)
   - Beyond range: Grey circle + distance display
2. Use ground-targeted skill → See line + AoE circle telegraph
3. Use cone skill (flamer) → See cone-shaped telegraph with 60° spread

### Buff/Debuff Indicators
1. Apply buff to character → Green icon with duration ring appears above head
2. Apply debuff → Red icon with duration ring
3. Stack multiple debuffs → See stack count in corner badge
4. Check party frames → Max 3 buffs shown per member

### Low Energy Warning
1. Use skills until energy drops below 20%
2. Energy bar pulses blue
3. "LOW ENERGY" text appears above skill bar
4. Both pulse in sync (1.5s cycle)

### Projectile Effects
1. Fire ranged attack → See glowing projectile with trail
2. Projectile travels in arc to target
3. Different colors for different damage types

### Cone Effects
1. Use cone attack (flamer/shotgun) → See particle spray in 60° cone
2. Particles spread from source
3. Cone telegraph shows range and angle before cast

### Party UI with Buffs
1. Have party members/companions
2. Apply buffs → See buff icons below health bars
3. Verify max 3 buffs shown
4. Hover icons for tooltip with full effect name

**DECISION: needs_backend**

The implementation requires backend support for:
- Skill validation error codes to trigger error feedback
- Buff/debuff state tracking and synchronization
- Range validation on server side
- Status effect application/removal events
- Energy state synchronization for low energy warnings
