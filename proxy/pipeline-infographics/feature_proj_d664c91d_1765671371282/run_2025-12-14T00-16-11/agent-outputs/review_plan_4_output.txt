## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Missing Information

#### 1. **Incomplete Buff/Debuff System Design**
The visual-combat-design.md provides basic visual treatment (icons, particles, colors) but is missing:
- **Which buffs/debuffs exist in the game?** (design docs should specify all status effects)
- **Stacking behavior display** (how are multiple stacks of same buff shown?)
- **Priority system for "3 most important"** (what makes a condition "important"?)
- **Specific buff/debuff types per faction/class** (docs should list these)

#### 2. **Party Frame Layout Specifics**
Requirements mention "compact mode for raids" but:
- **Raid size is not specified** (how many total party members in a raid?)
- **Overflow behavior unclear** (what happens with >7 party members?)
- **Hero vs Henchmen distinction** (are these displayed differently? design docs should specify)
- **Positioning/sizing specifics** (pixel dimensions, spacing between frames)

#### 3. **Energy System Visual Feedback**
The energy bar design is present but:
- **Energy costs per skill not referenced** (should be in skill design docs)
- **Regen rate visualization** (how fast should visible fill animation be?)
- **Energy gain effects** (are there skills that restore energy? how shown?)

#### 4. **Projectile/Cone Effect Gaps**
Basic specs exist but missing:
- **Per-skill VFX mapping** (which skills use projectile vs cone vs instant?)
- **Faction-specific effect variations** (Bolter vs Pulse Rifle vs Shoota - all different?)
- **Miss vs dodge vs block visual differences** (should be in combat-design.md)

#### 5. **Error State Edge Cases**
Basic error messages specified but missing:
- **Line of sight blocked** (separate from out of range?)
- **Target immune** (different from invalid target?)
- **Skill disabled by condition** (dazed, stunned - how shown?)

### Docs to Check

1. **skill-design.md** (or equivalent)
   - Should contain complete skill list with VFX type per skill
   - Energy costs
   - Range values
   - Buff/debuff effects applied by each skill

2. **combat-design.md** (re-read sections on conditions/status effects)
   - Complete list of buffs/debuffs in game
   - Stacking rules
   - Priority/importance system

3. **party-system-design.md** (or equivalent)
   - Hero vs Henchmen mechanics
   - Party size limits
   - Raid composition rules

4. **ui-design.md** (if exists)
   - Screen layout specifications
   - Party frame positioning/sizing
   - UI scale/resolution standards

### Specific Extractions Needed

From **visual-combat-design.md**:
- Re-check lines for any references to stacking buffs (may have been missed)
- Look for "priority" or "important" condition definitions

From **skill-design.md** (if exists):
- Extract VFX type for EACH skill (projectile/cone/instant/ground)
- Extract energy costs (for proper energy bar testing)

From **combat-design.md**:
- Extract complete condition list (Bleeding, Burning, Deep Wound, etc.)
- Extract stacking rules

### Red Flags Found

1. **"3 most important conditions"** - This is a design rule but no system for determining importance was extracted. This needs the actual priority algorithm or tier list from docs.

2. **"Compact mode toggle for raids"** - References raids but no raid size specification found. This suggests party-system-design.md was not consulted.

3. **Generic damage type specs without skill mapping** - We have color codes for 8 damage types but no extraction of which skills use which type. This should be in skill-design.md.

### Required Action

Re-extract requirements after consulting:
1. skill-design.md (complete skill->VFX->damage type mapping)
2. combat-design.md (complete condition system)
3. party-system-design.md or equivalent (party/hero/henchmen rules)
4. Any UI specification documents

The current requirements are **70% complete** - visual treatment is well-specified but game system integration is missing critical details.
