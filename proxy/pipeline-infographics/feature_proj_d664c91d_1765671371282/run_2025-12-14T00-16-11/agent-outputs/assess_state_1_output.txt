## Recommendation

The game client is fully operational with existing visual effects systems. The user is requesting improvements to existing combat feedback:
- Better visual effects for ranged attacks and cone abilities
- Range/energy feedback when skills fail
- Buff/debuff status display
- UI for heroes/henchmen (companions)
- Remove DPS meter

All of these are enhancements to existing client-side systems that are already in place.
