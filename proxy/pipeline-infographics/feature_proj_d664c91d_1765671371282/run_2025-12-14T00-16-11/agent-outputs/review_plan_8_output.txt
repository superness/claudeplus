- Layout hierarchy (player → party → henchmen/heroes) preserved
- Max 7 frames (4 party + 3 companions) specified
- Interaction behaviors (left click, right click, ctrl+click, drag) documented
- Range fading behavior included

**7. Skill VFX Examples - COMPLETE**
- Representative skill VFX from visual-combat-design.md:292-446 included
- Damage type visual specifications comprehensive
- Faction identity preserved in effect design

**8. Floating Combat Text - COMPLETE**
- Damage number specifications from visual-combat-design.md:452-523 extracted

- FPS targets for minimum/recommended specs specified
- Draw call limits included

**10. DPS Meter Removal - CLEAR**
- Explicit removal instruction documented
- File location specified (client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts:857-911)

### Fidelity Check

✅ **Quotes match original docs** - All extracted quotes verified against source
✅ **No invented requirements** - All specifications traceable to design docs
✅ **Specific numbers preserved** - Hex colors, pixel dimensions, durations all exact
✅ **Aesthetic/style from docs preserved** - Guild Wars 1 philosophy maintained
✅ **Referenced games accurately represented** - GW1 readability-first approach captured

### Missing Information Analysis

**Ground Telegraph System** - ADDRESSED
The requirement correctly identifies this is optional for player skills, required for boss attacks, with test mode toggle. This matches the design intent.

**Hero/Henchmen Command UI** - CORRECTLY NOTED AS MISSING
The extraction correctly identified that no dedicated command UI is specified in design docs. Party frame interaction (right-click context menu) is the documented interface.

**Buff Duration Display Format** - RESOLVED
Correctly specified: shrinking ring visual in normal gameplay, numeric timers only in Testing Arena mode.

**Projectile Miss Behavior** - SPECIFIED
Correctly extracted: "Projectile continues past target" from visual-combat-design.md:151

### Red Flags - NONE FOUND

❌ No "basic" or "simple" versions substituted for specified systems
❌ No generic placeholders instead of documented specifics
❌ No missing mechanics that docs explicitly describe
❌ No misinterpretation of referenced systems

### Implementation Checklist Validation

The 8-phase implementation plan:
- ✅ Prioritizes user pain points (error feedback first)
- ✅ All items traceable to design doc line numbers
- ✅ Specific hex colors, dimensions, durations preserved
- ✅ Performance targets included
- ✅ DPS meter removal explicitly called out

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements capture the design intent with high fidelity. All critical specifications are present:
- Exact error messages and colors
- Specific hex values for all visual elements
- Precise timing and duration values
- Performance constraints documented
- Visual hierarchy preserved
- Guild Wars 1 philosophy maintained

**DECISION: plan_approved**
