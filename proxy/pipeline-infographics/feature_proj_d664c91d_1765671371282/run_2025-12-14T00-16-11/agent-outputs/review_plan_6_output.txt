## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Analysis

I have reviewed the extracted requirements against the original design documentation. While the extraction is **extensive and thorough**, there are **critical gaps** and some **missing visual specifications** that need to be addressed before implementation.

### What's Good

The extraction correctly identifies:
- ✅ Complete damage type color specifications
- ✅ Floating combat text system with sizes and colors
- ✅ Threat tier visual hierarchy
- ✅ DPS meter removal requirement
- ✅ Performance targets and technical specifications
- ✅ Guild Wars 1 design philosophy

### Missing Specifications

#### 1. **Range Indicator Visual Specification**
The requirements mention "OUT OF RANGE" text feedback but don't specify:
- Does the skill slot itself show a visual indicator when target is out of range?
- Should there be ground-based range circles/indicators?
- visual-combat-design.md lines 1235-1267 cover skill bar states but don't mention range visualization

#### 2. **Cone/AoE Targeting Visualization**
Requirements specify cone angles (45-90°) and ranges (400-800 units) but missing:
- **Ground telegraph system** - Do cone abilities show a ground projection before activation?
- Guild Wars 1 had minimal telegraphing; Space Marine 2/Darktide have ground indicators
- This is critical for "it just looks like nothing happens" user complaint

#### 3. **Hero/Henchmen Command UI**
User explicitly stated: "I need UI for the heroes\henchmen"

Current extraction shows party frames but **missing from requirements**:
- Hero skill bar display (henchmen-heroes-design.md lines 95-142 specify heroes have custom skill bars)
- Command radial menu/interface (mentioned in henchmen-heroes-design.md lines 165-198)
- Hero behavior mode indicators (Aggressive/Defensive/Passive)

**Critical omission** - The extracted requirements focus on party *frame* display but not hero *control* UI.

#### 4. **Buff Duration Clarity**
Requirements state "Duration indicator: Shrinking ring" but missing:
- Does the shrinking ring show on the icon or around the character?
- Are there numeric duration timers shown?
- Guild Wars 1 showed duration timers on buff icons

#### 5. **Projectile Miss/Hit Feedback**
Requirements cover "MISS" text but missing:
- Do projectiles visually miss (travel past target)?
- Or do they disappear on "miss"?
- Critical for "I can't tell what's happening" complaint

### Docs That Need Re-Reading

1. **henchmen-heroes-design.md** - Lines 95-198
   - Hero skill bar display
   - Command interface
   - Behavior mode indicators

2. **visual-combat-design.md** - Lines 380-449 (section between floating text and threat tiers)
   - Check for ground telegraph/targeting reticle specifications
   - Check for pre-cast indicators

3. **combat-design.md** - Lines 35-62 (targeting and range section)
   - Check for range visualization requirements
   - Check for targeting feedback specifications

### Red Flags Found

❌ **"Cannot be derived - NOT in design docs"** section lists 4 items, but at least **item #3 (Per-Skill VFX Mapping)** should be derivable by reading combat-design.md skill descriptions more carefully.

❌ **Missing Hero/Henchmen control UI** despite user explicitly requesting it - this is a major omission.

### Action Required

1. Re-read **henchmen-heroes-design.md lines 95-198** to extract hero command UI specifications
2. Re-read **visual-combat-design.md lines 380-449** for targeting/telegraph specifications
3. Re-read **combat-design.md lines 35-62** for range feedback specifications
4. Cross-reference skill descriptions in combat-design.md with VFX categories to create a mapping
5. Clarify buff duration display (numeric timers vs ring only)
6. Clarify projectile miss behavior (visual trajectory vs instant disappear)

### Recommendation

The current extraction is **80% complete** but missing critical UI elements for hero/henchmen control and some visual feedback specifications. These gaps will cause confusion during implementation.
