I've verified all the code against the original design documents. The requirements are accurate and complete.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

1. **Canvas native size**: Confirmed at `game.js:486-487` - canvas is 512×512 pixels (8 × 64)
2. **CONFIG.tileSize**: Confirmed at `game.js:9` - exactly 64 pixels
3. **Current click handler**: Confirmed at `game.js:427-433` - uses raw `clickX/clickY` divided by `CONFIG.tileSize` without accounting for CSS scaling
4. **CSS responsive scaling**: Confirmed at `style.css:261-264` - `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` cause the canvas to scale down on narrower viewports
5. **Design doc Input System**: Confirmed at `game-design.md:288-323` - specifies click-to-select and click-to-move mechanics

### Analysis Confirms Root Cause

The extracted requirements correctly identify the bug:
- When CSS scales the canvas (e.g., from 512px to 320px display width), `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the displayed size (320px)
- The click offset is calculated relative to displayed canvas: correct
- But division by `CONFIG.tileSize` (64) assumes native 512px canvas, yielding wrong board coordinates

### Fix is Correct

The proposed fix to calculate scale ratios and multiply click coordinates is the standard solution for CSS-scaled canvases:
```javascript
const scaleX = this.canvas.width / rect.width;
const scaleY = this.canvas.height / rect.height;
```

### No Red Flags Found
- No generic placeholders - specific line numbers and code referenced
- No invented requirements - all derived from actual design docs and code
- Quotes match original sources exactly
- Fix follows well-established canvas coordinate transformation pattern

### Ready for Implementation
The requirements accurately capture the design intent and correctly diagnose the coordinate scaling issue. Proceed to implementation.
