Now I have a complete understanding of the issue.

## Next Feature: Fix Canvas Click Coordinate Scaling

### Already Implemented
All 9 game systems are fully implemented in `game.js`:
1. Board System - 8x8 grid with dark/light squares
2. Piece System - Red and black pieces with king support
3. Movement System - Diagonal move validation
4. Capture System - Jump validation and mandatory captures
5. Turn System - Turn management and multi-jump handling
6. King Promotion System - Promotion logic
7. Win Condition System - Win/draw detection
8. Input System - Click handling and piece selection
9. Rendering System - Canvas drawing with highlights

### From Design Docs
The design document specifies Input System (System 8) should:
- Click to select piece (must be current player's piece)
- Click destination to move (if valid)
- Highlight valid moves for selected piece

The current code at `game.js:427-433` handles clicks but has a **coordinate scaling bug**:
```javascript
const rect = this.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
const clickX = event.clientX - rect.left;
const clickY = event.clientY - rect.top;

const x = Math.floor(clickX / CONFIG.tileSize);
const y = 7 - Math.floor(clickY / CONFIG.tileSize);
```

The CSS at `style.css:261-264` applies responsive scaling on mobile:
```css
#game-canvas {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

When the canvas is CSS-scaled, `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the **displayed size**, but the click calculation uses the fixed `CONFIG.tileSize` (64px) which assumes the canvas is rendered at its native 512x512 resolution. This mismatch causes clicks to map to wrong board coordinates.

### Why This Feature Next
This is **the core mechanic bug** - the player literally cannot interact with the game. Without working clicks, no gameplay is possible. This is priority #1 because it's the foundation that everything else depends on.
