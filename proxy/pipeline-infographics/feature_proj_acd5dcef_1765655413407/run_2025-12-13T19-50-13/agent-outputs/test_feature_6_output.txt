I found the issue. Let me trace through the full integration path carefully:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - JavaScript has valid syntax, no obvious errors.

### Integration Path Verification

**User Click → Piece Selection → Move Execution:**

1. **Entry point**: `InputSystem.handleClick()` at line 427
2. **Click handler registration**: Line 424 - `this.canvas.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this))` ✅
3. **Coordinate calculation**: Lines 428-439 ✅ (Correctly calculates x, y with CSS scaling)
4. **Y-coordinate flip**: Line 439 - `const y = 7 - Math.floor(clickY / CONFIG.tileSize)` ✅

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:**

Looking at the CSS (lines 261-264):
```css
#game-canvas {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

Combined with the RenderingSystem at lines 492-493:
```javascript
this.canvas.width = CONFIG.boardSize * CONFIG.tileSize;  // 512
this.canvas.height = CONFIG.boardSize * CONFIG.tileSize; // 512
```

**The canvas has NO explicit width/height in CSS for desktop.** The canvas sets internal dimensions (512x512) but the CSS does NOT set a display size. This means `rect.width` and `rect.height` in `getBoundingClientRect()` will return the INTRINSIC canvas size (512x512), making the scale factors always 1.0 - which is actually correct behavior.

Let me re-examine the click handler more carefully by checking if there's an issue with how the game initializes:

**Checking DOMContentLoaded initialization**: Line 773-774:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    new GameController();
});
```

**Checking canvas retrieval**: Line 616:
```javascript
this.canvas = document.getElementById('game-canvas');
```

Wait - I need to verify if there's a **pointer-events** issue or z-index issue. Let me check if any overlay is blocking clicks:

Looking at the modal (lines 163-180 in CSS), the modal has `z-index: 1000` but starts with `display: none` via `.modal.hidden`.

**ACTUAL BUG FOUND:**

Looking at the piece positions and the Y-flip logic:

In `handleClick()` line 439:
```javascript
const y = 7 - Math.floor(clickY / CONFIG.tileSize); // Flip Y for board coordinates
```

In `RenderingSystem.drawBoard()` line 505:
```javascript
const screenY = 7 - y; // Flip Y for screen coordinates
```

In `PieceSystem.setupInitialPieces()` lines 104-116:
- Red pieces are at y=0, 1, 2 (bottom of data model)
- Black pieces are at y=5, 6, 7 (top of data model)

But in rendering:
- `screenY = 7 - y` means y=0 renders at screenY=7 (bottom of screen)
- `screenY = 7 - y` means y=7 renders at screenY=0 (top of screen)

So RED pieces at y=0,1,2 appear at BOTTOM of screen (screenY=7,6,5).
Black pieces at y=5,6,7 appear at TOP of screen (screenY=2,1,0).

In the click handler:
- Click at top of canvas → `clickY` is small → `Math.floor(clickY / 64)` is 0-2
- `y = 7 - 0` = 7, `y = 7 - 1` = 6, `y = 7 - 2` = 5 → y=5,6,7 (BLACK pieces' y coordinates)

So clicking on the BLACK pieces at top of screen would try to get pieces at y=5,6,7, which is CORRECT.

Clicking on RED pieces at bottom → `clickY` is large → `Math.floor(clickY/64)` is 5,6,7
`y = 7 - 5` = 2, `y = 7 - 6` = 1, `y = 7 - 7` = 0 → y=0,1,2 (RED pieces' y coordinates) ✅

**THE LOGIC IS CORRECT!**

But wait - the user says "Red's Turn" is indicated and they can't click anything. Let me check if maybe the game controller isn't properly being instantiated.

Let me check if there's an issue with how `turnSystem.currentPlayer` is checked:

Line 456: `if (clickedPiece && clickedPiece.owner === this.turnSystem.currentPlayer)`

Since `currentPlayer` starts as `'red'`, clicking on a red piece SHOULD work.

**POTENTIAL ISSUE: JavaScript error during initialization?**

There's no error handling. If `document.getElementById('game-canvas')` returns null (script runs before DOM is ready?), the game breaks silently.

But DOMContentLoaded should prevent that...

**WAIT - I see a CSS responsive issue:**

Lines 261-264:
```css
#game-canvas {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

When `height: auto` is used on a canvas WITHOUT an explicit CSS height, and the canvas sets `this.canvas.height = 512` programmatically, the canvas should display at 512x512. But `height: auto` on canvas can behave unexpectedly.

**THE ACTUAL BUG:** The canvas IS NOT being rendered properly because the JS sets `width` and `height` attributes, but the CSS `height: auto` for responsive may collapse the height to 0 or cause aspect ratio issues.

### Disconnected Systems Found
None - all systems are properly wired together.

### Placeholder Code Found
None - no TODOs, FIXMEs, or stubs found.

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL: CSS `height: auto` on canvas with responsive design**

The CSS at lines 261-264 sets `height: auto` for the canvas in responsive mode. This can cause the canvas height to collapse or behave unexpectedly because:
1. Canvas doesn't have an intrinsic aspect ratio like images
2. When only `max-width: 100%` is set without explicit height handling, clicks may not map correctly

**Additionally**: The canvas has no explicit CSS width/height for non-responsive viewport, relying entirely on the JavaScript-set width/height attributes. While this usually works, it can cause issues in certain browser/CSS combinations.

**Recommended Fix:** Add explicit CSS dimensions or aspect-ratio handling:
```css
#game-canvas {
    width: 512px;
    height: 512px;
}

@media (max-width: 550px) {
    #game-canvas {
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
        aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
    }
}
```

Or verify the canvas is actually receiving click events by checking if any other element is intercepting them.
