## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Missing explicit CSS dimensions on canvas
- File: `client/style.css`
- Fix: Added `width: 512px;` and `height: 512px;` to the `#game-canvas` rule (lines 117-124). This ensures the canvas has explicit display dimensions that match the internal canvas resolution (512x512), so click coordinates are calculated correctly via `getBoundingClientRect()`.

### Issue 2: Responsive canvas using `max-width` without proper aspect ratio
- File: `client/style.css`
- Fix: Changed the responsive media query canvas styling from `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` to `width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;` (lines 263-267). The `aspect-ratio` CSS property ensures the canvas maintains a 1:1 square ratio even when scaled down on mobile, preventing height collapse and ensuring click coordinate scaling works correctly.
