## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - `client/index.html`, `client/game.js`, `client/style.css`
- **Design docs**: `design-docs/game-design.md` - comprehensive American Checkers design with 9 systems
- **Backend code**: Client-only game (pure JavaScript, no backend required)
- **Can run**: Yes - static HTML/JS/CSS that can be opened directly in browser

## Analysis of the Click Problem

I've analyzed the game code and found the issue. The game has a complete implementation with:
- All 9 systems from the design doc implemented
- Canvas-based rendering with click handling
- Piece selection and move highlighting working in code

**The bug is in the coordinate transformation.** Looking at `game.js:432-433`:

```javascript
const x = Math.floor(clickX / CONFIG.tileSize);
const y = 7 - Math.floor(clickY / CONFIG.tileSize); // Flip Y for board coordinates
```

The click coordinates are calculated based on `CONFIG.tileSize` (64 pixels), but the canvas might be scaling differently when rendered in the browser, especially:

1. The CSS has `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` for responsive design (line 261-264)
2. The canvas is set to 512x512 pixels (8 * 64), but CSS scaling could cause coordinate mismatch
3. `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the displayed size, not the canvas resolution

**Likely fix needed**: The click handler needs to account for canvas scaling by comparing `canvas.width` to `rect.width`.

## Recommendation

The game client is fully built and functional in terms of code structure, but has a **canvas coordinate scaling bug** that prevents clicks from registering correctly. This is a feature-level bug fix, not a setup issue.
