## Implemented

Fixed the click handler coordinate transformation bug in `InputSystem.handleClick()` at `game.js:427-439`.

## Design Compliance

- **Requirement**: Input System click handler must account for CSS canvas scaling (from design doc sections on Input System lines 288-323 and verified bug analysis)
  - **Implementation**: Added `scaleX` and `scaleY` factors calculated as `canvas.width / rect.width` and `canvas.height / rect.height`. These scale the raw click coordinates back to native canvas coordinates before dividing by `CONFIG.tileSize`.

- **Requirement**: Canvas native size is 512×512 (8 tiles × 64 pixels per tile)
  - **Implementation**: The fix correctly uses `this.canvas.width` (512) and `this.canvas.height` (512) as the reference for native coordinates.

## Files Modified

- `client/game.js` (lines 427-439)

## How to Test

1. Open the game in a browser
2. Resize the browser window so the canvas is smaller than 512×512 (CSS scales it down)
3. Click on a red piece - it should highlight with valid moves shown
4. Click on a valid move destination - the piece should move
5. Test at different window sizes to confirm clicks map correctly to board squares
