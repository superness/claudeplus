UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a bitcoin_daemon_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to manage Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode with capabilities like installation verification, configuration generation, starting/stopping daemon, querying status, generating blocks, and wallet management. The final JSON should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Examine the CoiniumServ codebase to understand Bitcoin daemon integration patterns
3. Review existing agent JSON structures in the claudeplus/agents directory to follow the correct format
4. Design the agent JSON with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)
5. Create comprehensive task definitions for each required capability
6. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 2.1
2) Use Glob tool to find existing agent JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ directory for format reference
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing agent JSONs to understand the structure (permissions, tasks, decisions, prompts)
4) Use Grep tool to search CoiniumServ codebase for Bitcoin daemon integration patterns (search for "bitcoind", "bitcoin-cli", "regtest")
5) Use Read tool to examine relevant Bitcoin daemon configuration files in build/bin/Debug/config/coins/bitcoin.json
6) Design agent JSON structure with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decisions array: ["daemon_started", "daemon_stopped", "daemon_error", "error"]
   - Task definitions for each requirement (install/verify, configure, start, stop, status query, block generation, wallet management)
   - Appropriate prompts and instructions for each task
7) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json with the complete agent definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- The plan will ensure the agent can handle missing bitcoind installations (install/verify task)
- Will include error handling for daemon startup failures (daemon_error decision)
- Will account for scenarios where daemon is already running or already stopped
- Will validate proper regtest configuration generation with appropriate RPC settings
- Will test graceful shutdown vs force-kill scenarios
- Will verify wallet creation with proper funding mechanisms using generatetoaddress
- Will ensure status queries work both when daemon is running and when stopped
- Edge cases: insufficient permissions, port conflicts, corrupted data directories, network unavailability

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the actual content of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Will show examples of existing agent JSON structures found in the repository
- Will display Bitcoin-related configuration patterns found in CoiniumServ codebase
- Will present the complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json structure before writing
- Will show the exact file path and confirmation of successful write operation
- Will demonstrate how each task maps to the specified requirements
- Will show how decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error) are integrated into task flows

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined task with clear requirements, specific file locations, and concrete deliverables. The agent structure follows a standard JSON format with defined permissions and decision points. The Bitcoin daemon management tasks are standard operations with well-documented bitcoin-cli commands. The main uncertainty is the exact format expected by the claudeplus agent system, which will be resolved by examining existing agent examples.

DECISION: design_complete
