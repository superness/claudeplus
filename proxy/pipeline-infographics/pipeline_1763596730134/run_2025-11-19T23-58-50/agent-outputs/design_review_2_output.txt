ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the requirements and includes a methodical approach to building the pool_server_manager agent. The plan correctly identifies the need to:
- Read the source specification document (MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1)
- Locate the CoiniumServ executable in the codebase
- Examine existing configuration files
- Handle WSL→Windows cross-platform execution complexities
- Create a complete agent JSON with proper tool permissions and decision points

The step-by-step approach is logical and sequential, starting with information gathering (reading docs, locating files) before proceeding to agent design and creation. The plan acknowledges the complexity of WSL→Windows process management, which shows appropriate awareness of potential challenges.

The test considerations are comprehensive and cover important scenarios:
- Multiple executable locations (Debug/Release)
- Config generation flexibility
- Path translation between WSL and Windows
- Process state monitoring
- Error handling and crash scenarios
- Log parsing capabilities
- Graceful shutdown

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**

The proposed evidence is concrete and verifiable:
1. **Documentation evidence**: Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 - can be verified by reading the file
2. **Executable location**: Specific paths to CoiniumServ.exe - can be verified via file system
3. **Configuration structure**: Existing config.json format - can be verified by examining files
4. **Deliverable**: Complete agent JSON at specified path - can be verified by reading the created file
5. **Technical examples**: WSL→Windows execution commands and log patterns - can be validated against actual usage

The evidence clearly demonstrates completion criteria: if the agent JSON exists at the specified path with all required components (tools, decisions, instructions for cross-platform execution, config generation, monitoring, and shutdown), the task is verifiably complete.

CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: The "Medium" confidence rating is appropriately cautious given the cross-platform complexity. The reasoning is sound - the planner acknowledges uncertainty around CoiniumServ's exact launch requirements and path translation mechanics, which are implementation details that may require iteration.

**Minor Concerns**:
- The plan doesn't explicitly mention examining CoiniumServ documentation or command-line arguments (though this may be implicit in examining configs)
- No mention of checking if other agents exist in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ to understand the JSON structure format (though the requirements are clear enough)

These are minor gaps that don't fundamentally undermine the plan's viability.
