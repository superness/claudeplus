UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the pool_server_manager agent that will manage CoiniumServ mining pool software from WSL to Windows, based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This includes launching, monitoring, and managing the pool server process across WSL/Windows boundaries.

APPROACH: First, I'll read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 requirements. Then I'll examine the existing codebase to locate CoiniumServ executable paths, understand the config structure, and identify any existing configuration files. I'll design the agent JSON structure with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision points (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error) that can handle cross-platform execution and monitoring.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications
2) Use Glob tool to locate CoiniumServ executable (search patterns: "**/CoiniumServ.exe", "**/bin/**/*.exe")
3) Use Read tool to examine existing config examples (build/bin/Debug/config/config.json, build/bin/Debug/config/config-example.json)
4) Use Grep tool to search for any existing pool management scripts or launch configurations
5) Design agent JSON with:
   - Instructions for cross-platform WSL→Windows execution
   - Tool permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
   - Decision points: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error
   - Context about CoiniumServ paths, config generation, process monitoring
6) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the agent can locate CoiniumServ.exe in multiple possible locations (Debug/Release builds)
- Will ensure config.json generation handles both default and custom pool configurations
- Will test WSL→Windows process execution with proper path translation (e.g., /mnt/c/... to C:\...)
- Will validate process monitoring can detect running/stopped states
- Will handle scenarios where CoiniumServ fails to start or crashes
- Will test log parsing for pool initialization, errors, and successful operation
- Will verify graceful shutdown commands work correctly

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Located paths to CoiniumServ.exe
- Structure of existing config.json files
- Complete agent JSON specification showing all required capabilities
- Example Bash commands for WSL→Windows execution (e.g., cmd.exe /c, powershell.exe)
- Log file paths and parsing patterns

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While I can read the plan document and existing configs, the WSL→Windows cross-platform process management adds complexity. The success depends on understanding the exact CoiniumServ launch requirements and ensuring the agent has proper context for path translation and process monitoring across the WSL/Windows boundary.
