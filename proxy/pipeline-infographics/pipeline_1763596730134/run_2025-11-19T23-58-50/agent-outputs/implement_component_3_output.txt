Excellent! The agent JSON has been successfully created. Let me create a summary of what was built:

## Summary

I have successfully created the **pool_server_manager agent** based on section 2.1 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent JSON file has been written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json`.

### Agent Capabilities

The pool_server_manager agent includes comprehensive capabilities for:

1. **CoiniumServ Executable Management**
   - Locates CoiniumServ.exe in Debug/Release builds
   - Verifies installation and accessibility from WSL
   - Handles WSL↔Windows path translation

2. **Pool Configuration Generation**
   - Generates pool config files (pools/default.json)
   - Configures daemon RPC connection settings
   - Sets stratum port, difficulty, wallet addresses
   - Validates JSON configuration syntax

3. **WSL→Windows Process Execution**
   - Launches CoiniumServ.exe from WSL using cmd.exe
   - Manages working directory requirements
   - Handles background execution
   - Proper path translation for cross-platform operation

4. **Process Health Monitoring**
   - Checks if pool process is running (tasklist.exe)
   - Verifies Stratum port listening (netstat)
   - Monitors resource usage and performance
   - Detects crashes and unhealthy states

5. **Log Parsing & Analysis**
   - Parses server.log and debug.log
   - Identifies startup, errors, miner connections
   - Detects daemon RPC issues
   - Monitors block submissions and share acceptance

6. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Terminates pool process cleanly (taskkill.exe)
   - Verifies port release and process cleanup
   - Checks final log entries
   - Handles forced shutdown for emergencies

### Configuration

The agent includes:
- **Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- **Decisions**: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error
- **Default paths** for CoiniumServ executables, configs, and logs
- **Pool defaults**: Stratum port 3333, low regtest difficulty
- **Daemon defaults**: RPC connection settings for Bitcoin regtest
- **Timing parameters**: Startup wait, shutdown timeout, health checks

### Key Features

- Comprehensive error handling for common issues (port conflicts, RPC failures, config errors)
- Detailed troubleshooting guidance for daemon integration
- WSL/Windows cross-platform best practices
- Configuration templates for quick setup and production use
- Integration with Bitcoin daemon manager for full stack operation

The agent is production-ready and follows the same structure and quality standards as the bitcoin_daemon_manager agent.
