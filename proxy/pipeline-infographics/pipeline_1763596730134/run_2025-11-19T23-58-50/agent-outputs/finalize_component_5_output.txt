## VERIFICATION REPORT

### VERIFICATION: Detailed Analysis of What Was Delivered vs What Was Promised

**Task Requirement**: Build the pool_server_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md

**What Was Delivered**:
The pool_server_manager agent JSON file was successfully created at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json` (28KB, 77 lines). The agent is a complete, production-ready component with:

1. **Complete Structural Integrity**:
   - All 10 required JSON fields present (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria, requiredTools, decisions, configuration)
   - Valid JSON syntax (verified with Python json.tool)
   - Consistent structure with bitcoin_daemon_manager agent

2. **Requirements from Section 2.1 - ALL IMPLEMENTED**:
   - ✅ **Locate CoiniumServ executable**: System prompt includes Glob patterns, multiple search paths, WSL path translation
   - ✅ **Generate pool configuration**: Complete JSON templates for pools/default.json with daemon RPC, stratum, wallet settings
   - ✅ **Launch via WSL→Windows exec**: Three launch methods (cmd.exe, PowerShell, direct), working directory management, background execution
   - ✅ **Monitor process health**: tasklist.exe process checking, netstat port monitoring, resource usage, log activity monitoring
   - ✅ **Parse pool logs**: Log locations (server.log, debug.log), important patterns (startup, errors, RPC), parsing commands
   - ✅ **Shutdown pool server**: taskkill.exe graceful shutdown, force shutdown option, verification procedures, cleanup

3. **Tools and Decisions - EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED**:
   - Tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep (6/6 match)
   - Decisions: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error (4/4 match)

4. **System Prompt Quality - EXCEPTIONAL**:
   - 24,280 characters, 696 lines, 15 major sections
   - Covers: Installation, Configuration, Lifecycle Management, Health Monitoring, Log Parsing, Shutdown, WSL/Windows Integration
   - Complete operational workflows: Cold Start, Quick Start, Status Check, Restart, Stop, Config Generation
   - Comprehensive error handling: Port conflicts, RPC failures, invalid config, missing dependencies, permissions
   - Integration guidance: Daemon requirements, connection testing, common issues, verification steps
   - Code examples: cmd.exe, PowerShell, tasklist, netstat, taskkill, log parsing commands
   - Configuration templates: Minimal (testing) and Production-ready versions

5. **Configuration Section - PRODUCTION-READY**:
   - **defaultPaths**: CoiniumServ.exe locations (Debug/Release), config/log directories
   - **poolDefaults**: Stratum port 3333, bind 0.0.0.0, difficulty 0.000244140625 (regtest-appropriate)
   - **daemonDefaults**: Host 127.0.0.1, port 18443 (correct regtest), RPC credentials
   - **timing**: Startup wait 10s, shutdown timeout 30s, health check interval 20s
   - **execution**: Launch method cmd.exe, working directory required, background execution enabled

### EVIDENCE_CHECK: Assessment of Concrete Proof Provided

**Evidence Provided by Executor**:
1. ✅ Validation report confirming all structure, tools, decisions, criteria
2. ✅ Requirements verification showing all 6 Section 2.1 capabilities implemented
3. ✅ Daemon integration verification (RPC, getblocktemplate, host/port/credentials)
4. ✅ System prompt metrics (length, lines, sections)
5. ✅ Decision: "component_created"

**Independent Verification Performed**:
1. ✅ File exists at exact path: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json`
2. ✅ File size: 28KB (substantial, appropriate for comprehensive agent)
3. ✅ JSON validity: Confirmed with Python json.tool
4. ✅ All 10 required fields present
5. ✅ Tools match requirements: {'Bash', 'Edit', 'Glob', 'Grep', 'Read', 'Write'}
6. ✅ Decisions match requirements: {'error', 'pool_error', 'pool_started', 'pool_stopped'}
7. ✅ 8 expertise areas documented
8. ✅ 7 validation criteria defined
9. ✅ All 6 Section 2.1 capabilities verified in system prompt
10. ✅ Configuration defaults validated (regtest port 18443, stratum 3333, low difficulty)
11. ✅ Operational workflows present (Cold Start, Quick Start, Restart, Stop, etc.)
12. ✅ Error handling comprehensive (5 major scenarios documented)
13. ✅ Integration guidance complete (daemon requirements, testing, issues, verification)
14. ✅ Code examples extensive (cmd.exe, tasklist, netstat, taskkill)
15. ✅ Configuration templates provided (Minimal and Production)

**Concrete Evidence Score**: 15/15 checks passed
