ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding - The plan correctly identifies this is about creating an agent JSON configuration file for monitoring stratum protocol communications in a cryptocurrency mining pool context
2. Logical approach - The plan starts by finding existing agents to understand the schema, then explores stratum implementation details, and finally synthesizes a configuration
3. Systematic exploration - Good progression from schema discovery → protocol understanding → component synthesis → file creation
4. Covers all requirements - Each user requirement is addressed: message monitoring, protocol validation, health tracking, error detection, and logging

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague evidence specification** - "Will provide the complete agent JSON structure" and "Will reference specific stratum protocol message formats" are outcomes, not evidence collection methods
2. **Missing verification steps** - No plan to validate the JSON syntax, verify file permissions, or confirm the written file is readable/parseable
3. **Overconfident test considerations** - Lists many edge cases to "ensure" and "validate" but doesn't explain HOW these will be verified or what specific checks will be performed
4. **No concrete success criteria** - What specific elements MUST be present in the final JSON? What constitutes "protocol compliance" validation?
5. **Medium confidence without clear gaps** - The plan claims medium confidence but doesn't articulate what specific unknowns would be resolved to reach high confidence

**Critical Gaps:**
- Step 10 just says "write the complete agent JSON" but doesn't specify validation of the JSON against any schema
- No mention of how to verify the agent would actually work (e.g., testing against sample stratum messages)
- Evidence is described as future deliverables rather than concrete artifacts to collect during execution
- No fallback if existing agent examples don't exist or use a different schema

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The evidence section describes what will be produced (outputs) rather than what will be collected and verified during execution. Strong evidence would include:
- Specific JSON schema validation commands
- Concrete file path verification (ls, cat to confirm content)
- Comparison checkpoints against existing agent patterns
- Validation that all 4 required decision outputs are present in the final JSON
- Confirmation that required permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) are properly declared

The plan needs to specify WHAT artifacts prove each step succeeded, not just what the final deliverable looks like.

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific reasoning:** While the plan shows good understanding and a logical approach, it lacks concrete, verifiable evidence collection steps. The plan needs to specify:
1. Exact validation commands to verify JSON syntax (e.g., `python -m json.tool` or similar)
2. Specific checks to confirm all required fields are present (grep/search for "monitor_active", "protocol_valid", etc. in output)
3. File verification steps (check file exists, is readable, contains valid JSON)
4. Clear success criteria for each requirement mapping
5. Fallback strategies if agent examples are insufficient

The plan should be revised to include concrete verification steps after each major action, not just describe intended outcomes.
