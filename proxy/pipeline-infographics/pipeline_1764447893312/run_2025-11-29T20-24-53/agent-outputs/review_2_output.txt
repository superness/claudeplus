ASSESSMENT: This is a well-structured plan that demonstrates clear understanding of the task. The planner has:

1. **Correctly identified the source of truth** - Reading the DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md to extract specific parameters
2. **Logical step-by-step approach** - Starting with directory structure, then populating with files containing correct values
3. **Specific parameter values cited** - Port numbers, target times, address prefixes, magic bytes, etc. are all explicitly listed
4. **Consistency checks mentioned** - Recognizing that values must match across files (ports, prefixes, magic bytes)
5. **Clear evidence collection** - Using `ls -la`, `git status`, reading back files, and `git log`

**Strengths:**
- Follows Appendix A directory structure specification
- Includes moving DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md to doc/ as specified
- Plans to implement LWMA algorithm matching the Python pseudocode
- Includes the Genesis block message
- Plans proper git commit workflow

**Minor concerns addressed:**
- The plan specifies reading back key files to verify parameter values - this provides concrete proof
- Evidence collection includes both structural verification (directories) and content verification (parameter values)

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong - The proposed evidence includes:
- Directory structure verification via `ls -la`
- File staging verification via `git status`
- Content verification by reading back key files
- Commit verification via `git log`
This provides multiple layers of proof that the task was completed correctly.
