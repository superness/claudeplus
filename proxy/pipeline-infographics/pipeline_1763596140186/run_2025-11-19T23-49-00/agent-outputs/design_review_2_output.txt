ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding of requirements - the plan correctly identifies all needed capabilities (installation, configuration, lifecycle management, status queries, block generation, wallet operations)
2. Logical approach - starts by reading specifications and existing examples before creating the new agent
3. Includes reference to authoritative source (MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1)
4. Considers edge cases and error scenarios (daemon already running, wallet conflicts, RPC errors)
5. All required tools are properly identified
6. All required decisions are included

**Critical Issues:**
1. **No verification of JSON validity** - The plan writes JSON but doesn't validate it's syntactically correct
2. **Missing schema validation** - While it reads example agents, there's no explicit step to validate the created agent matches the required schema
3. **No functional testing** - Evidence only covers "file was written" but doesn't prove the agent will actually work when executed
4. **Weak evidence for completeness** - Simply providing file content doesn't prove it meets ALL requirements from section 2.1

**Evidence Quality Issues:**
- "Will provide content read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1" - Good, but doesn't prove implementation matches specs
- "Will show example agent JSON structure" - Good reference, but doesn't prove adherence
- "Will provide complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json file content" - This is just showing output, not proving correctness
- "Will verify file was written using ls" - Trivial check, doesn't prove quality
- "Will validate JSON structure matches schema" - Mentioned but no concrete method specified

**Missing Concrete Evidence:**
- No checksum or line-by-line verification that all section 2.1 requirements are addressed
- No comparison table: "Requirement X → Implementation Y"
- No syntax validation step (e.g., using `jq` or Python to parse JSON)
- No field-by-field schema compliance check

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence proves file creation but NOT correctness, completeness, or functional validity. The plan lacks verifiable checkpoints that each requirement from section 2.1 is implemented. Simply showing "the file content" is insufficient - there's no methodology to prove that content is correct, complete, or will function as intended.

**Specific Concerns:**
- How will we verify ALL daemon operations are covered in instructions?
- How will we prove the decision routing is correct?
- How will we verify the agent JSON is valid and parseable?
- What proves the instructions are clear enough to execute successfully?

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the approach is sound, the evidence collection is insufficient. The plan conflates "creating a file" with "creating a CORRECT file." There's no concrete verification methodology to prove the agent JSON:
1. Is syntactically valid JSON
2. Conforms to the agent schema
3. Implements ALL requirements from section 2.1
4. Will successfully execute when loaded

The plan needs explicit validation steps with pass/fail criteria, not just "show the output."
