ASSESSMENT:

The design specification is exceptionally thorough and demonstrates deep understanding of the requirements. The plan correctly identifies all key aspects:

1. **Understanding**: Correctly interprets the need to create a bitcoin_daemon_manager agent based on section 2.1, with all specified capabilities (install/verify, config generation, daemon lifecycle, RPC queries, block generation, wallet management).

2. **Approach**: Methodical and logical - starts with analyzing existing specifications and patterns, then synthesizes requirements into the claudeplus agent JSON structure. The decision to reference both the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md specification and existing patterns (browser_commander.json, SuperCoinServ bitcoin_daemon_manager.json) shows good research strategy.

3. **Steps**: The 12-step plan is concrete and well-sequenced:
   - Steps 1-4: Requirements gathering and capability extraction
   - Steps 5-9: Agent structure design with all required fields
   - Steps 10-11: Configuration and file writing
   - Step 12: Validation

4. **Specificity**: The plan includes specific details:
   - Exact line numbers (115-138, 133-137)
   - Specific JSON fields with examples (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, etc.)
   - All 7 capabilities enumerated
   - All 4 success criteria mapped
   - All 4 decision keywords listed
   - Exact file path specified

5. **Test Considerations**: Comprehensive coverage of test scenarios including cold start, RPC connectivity, block generation, wallet operations, graceful shutdown, error handling, and edge cases. This demonstrates understanding of real-world usage patterns.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**

The evidence collection plan is exceptionally robust:

1. **Primary deliverable**: Complete agent JSON file at exact specified path
2. **Specification compliance checklist**: Maps all 7 capabilities, 4 success criteria, required tools, and decision keywords to implementation
3. **Technical validation**: JSON syntax validation and structure verification
4. **File verification**: Path existence check
5. **Content verification**: Read-back validation to confirm all sections present

The evidence is:
- **Concrete**: Actual file with specific content requirements
- **Verifiable**: Can be checked programmatically (JSON parsing, field presence)
- **Comprehensive**: Covers both structure and content
- **Traceable**: Direct mapping to specification requirements

The checklist format with ✓ marks provides clear pass/fail criteria for each requirement.

DECISION: APPROVED

**Reasoning**: This plan meets all criteria for approval:
- Crystal clear understanding of requirements with specific citations
- Logical, well-sequenced 12-step approach
- Concrete, verifiable evidence (actual JSON file + compliance checklist + technical validation)
- High confidence appropriately justified with 7 specific reasons
- No vagueness - all capabilities, criteria, and fields explicitly enumerated
- Strong evidence quality with multiple validation layers

The plan will provide solid proof of completion through the deliverable file, specification compliance mapping, and validation checks.

DECISION: APPROVED
