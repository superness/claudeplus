UNDERSTANDING: User wants a complete agent JSON file for `bitcoin_daemon_manager` that manages Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode, based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to handle installation, configuration, daemon lifecycle, status queries, block generation, and wallet management.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Review existing agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory to understand the agent structure/schema
3. Design the agent with appropriate instructions, tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), and decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)
4. Structure the agent to handle all required Bitcoin daemon operations in regtest mode
5. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1. Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` directory structure and existing agent files to understand the JSON schema
2. Use Read tool to read `MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` and specifically examine section 2.1 for bitcoin_daemon_manager specifications
3. Use Glob tool to find example agent JSON files: `claudeplus/agents/*.json`
4. Use Read tool on 1-2 example agent files to understand the complete structure (instructions, tools, decisions, parameters, etc.)
5. Design the agent JSON with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Detailed instructions covering: bitcoind installation verification, regtest config generation, daemon start/stop, status queries (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo), block generation (generatetoaddress), wallet creation/funding
   - Tools array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decisions array with routing: ["daemon_started", "daemon_stopped", "daemon_error", "error"]
   - Any required parameters or environment variables
6. Use Write tool to create the complete agent JSON at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json`

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Agent instructions will handle fresh installation scenarios (bitcoind not present)
- Agent will verify existing bitcoind installations
- Agent will handle daemon already running scenarios
- Agent will include error handling for failed daemon starts
- Agent will gracefully handle stop requests when daemon isn't running
- Agent will include RPC connection error handling
- Agent will handle wallet creation conflicts (wallet already exists)
- Agent will include proper regtest configuration (no mainnet/testnet conflicts)

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the content read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Will show example agent JSON structure from existing agents
- Will provide the complete bitcoin_daemon_manager.json file content
- Will verify file was written to correct path using Bash ls command
- Will validate JSON structure matches the schema used by other agents

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a well-defined task with clear requirements, available reference materials (the automation plan and existing agent examples), and straightforward JSON file creation using available tools.
