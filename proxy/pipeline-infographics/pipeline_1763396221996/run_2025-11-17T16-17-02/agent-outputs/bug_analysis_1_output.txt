  "bugSummary": "Ship navigation completely broken - ships don't move to navigation targets despite targets being set correctly",
  "expectedBehavior": "When tapping/double-tapping an object (asteroid, station, anomaly, etc.), the ship should set the navigation target AND move toward that target using EVE-style physics acceleration",
  "actualBehavior": "Tapping objects successfully sets the navigation target (visible in UI), but the ship remains completely stationary. No movement occurs for single-tap or double-tap navigation. This is a regression - the functionality previously worked.",

    "Step 4: Observe that navigation target is set (UI shows target) but ship does NOT move",
    "Step 5: Try double-tap on a different object",
    "Step 6: Observe that ship still does NOT move to the target",

  "hypothesis": "The integration between mobile input (tap detection) and the navigation/movement system has broken. The tap events are successfully setting the navigation target (UI confirms this), but the connection between 'target set' and 'apply movement toward target' has been severed. Possible causes: 1) NavigationManager.setNavigationTarget() may not be triggering movement commands, 2) ShipPhysics may not be receiving navigation target updates, 3) The update loop may not be processing navigation targets to apply thrust, 4) A recent change to MobileInputManager may have broken the event chain, or 5) The simulator's main update loop may not be calling the navigation/movement update functions properly."
