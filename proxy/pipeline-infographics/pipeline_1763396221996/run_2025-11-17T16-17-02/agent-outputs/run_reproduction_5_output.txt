The issue is clear: the test script's relay is forwarding messages directly (raw strings) between clients, but it's not properly handling the `response` messages coming back from the game. Let me check what the TestingBrowserBridge actually sends:

Based on my analysis of the code:

1. **TestingBrowserBridge.js:196-202** sends responses as:
```javascript
{
  type: 'response',
  response: response  // The actual game response
}
```

2. **reproduce_ship_navigation_bug.js:327-339** expects to receive responses with just the response data directly (with `id`, `success`, etc. at the top level)

3. The relay in lines 210-227 just blindly forwards messages without unwrapping the `response` wrapper

This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** - the automation framework response handling is broken.

## Execution Report

**Test Execution Summary:**
- **Status**: FAILED due to framework error
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket automation framework response relay broken
- **Test Phase Reached**: Initial ship state retrieval (step 1 of 8)
- **Evidence File**: ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763397268673.json

**Framework Failure Analysis:**

1. **Game Connected Successfully**: The game browser instance connected to the WebSocket server
2. **Test Client Connected**: The test script client connected successfully
3. **Command Sent**: `getShipState` command was sent to the game
4. **Response Sent**: TestingBrowserBridge received the command and sent a response wrapped as `{type: 'response', response: {...}}`
5. **Relay Broken**: The relay in reproduce_ship_navigation_bug.js forwards the wrapped message directly without unwrapping the `response` field
6. **Handler Fails**: handleGameResponse() expects `{id, success, data, ...}` but receives `{type: 'response', response: {id, success, data, ...}}`
7. **Test Hangs**: The promise in sendGameCommandAsync() never resolves because the response ID doesn't match

**Technical Details:**
- TestingBrowserBridge.js:196-202 wraps responses in `{type: 'response', response: actualResponse}`
- reproduce_ship_navigation_bug.js:327-339 expects unwrapped responses
- The WebSocket relay (lines 210-227) blindly forwards messages without unwrapping
- This causes response.id to be undefined, so the promise never resolves

**Impact on Bug Reproduction:**
Cannot reproduce the ship navigation bug because the test infrastructure itself is broken. The automation framework cannot successfully execute ANY commands, not just navigation-related ones.
