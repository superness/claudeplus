## Execution Report

### Test Execution Status: **FAILED DUE TO FRAMEWORK ERROR**

### What Happened:
The reproduction script was executed successfully but failed to collect meaningful data about the ship navigation bug due to a **WebSocket automation framework failure**.

### Factual Observations:

1. **Test Script Started Successfully**
   - WebSocket automation server launched on port 8765
   - Chrome browser launched with testMode
   - Game connected to automation server

2. **Framework Failure Detected**
   - First command `getShipState` was sent to the game
   - Game responded with command echo but **no actual ship state data**
   - Response structure shows: `{"type": "command", "command": {...}}` (echoing the command)
   - Expected structure: Ship state with position, velocity, modules, etc.

3. **Evidence Collected**
   - File: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763397416987.json`
   - Status: FAILED
   - Reason: No data returned from game - only command echo

4. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Multiple recent test runs show identical failure pattern
   - All tests fail at the same point: getting initial ship state
   - This indicates the WebSocket command-response cycle is broken

### Root Cause:
The game's WebSocket automation handler (`js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js`) is not properly processing commands and returning data. The commands are being received but not executed, resulting in command echoes instead of actual responses.

### Impact on Bug Investigation:
**Cannot reproduce the ship navigation bug** because the test framework cannot communicate with the game to:
- Get ship position/velocity
- Set navigation targets
- Verify ship movement

The framework must be fixed before the ship navigation bug can be properly investigated.
