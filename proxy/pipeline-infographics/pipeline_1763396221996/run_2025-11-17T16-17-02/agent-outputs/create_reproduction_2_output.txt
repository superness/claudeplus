Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script that tests the ship navigation bug. The script:

1. **Connects to the game** via WebSocket automation framework
2. **Lists available commands** to verify connectivity
3. **Gets initial ship state** to establish baseline position/velocity
4. **Sets navigation target** to coordinates (1000, 0, 1000) using the `setNavigationTarget` command
5. **Waits 1 second** and checks if ship has started moving (velocity > 0.1 m/s)
6. **Waits 2 more seconds** and verifies the ship has accelerated and moved significantly (velocity > 1.0 m/s, distance > 10m)
7. **Tests object-based navigation** by finding a nearby asteroid/station and setting it as target
8. **Captures comprehensive evidence** including velocities at different time points and total distance moved

The script will **reproduce the bug** if:
- Navigation target is set successfully BUT
- Ship velocity remains near zero after 1 second AND/OR
- Ship hasn't moved significantly after 3 seconds

All evidence is saved to `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json` with detailed metrics.

**To run the script:**
```bash
node reproduce_ship_navigation_bug.js
```

**Expected outcome if bug exists:**
The test will FAIL at step 6 or 8, showing that the navigation target was set but the ship didn't move, with evidence showing near-zero velocity and minimal distance traveled.
