Perfect! The agent has been successfully created. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

# Network Monitor Agent - Component Created Successfully

## Summary

I have successfully created the `network_monitor` agent at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/network_monitor.json`. This agent monitors Bitcoin network connectivity and health by analyzing peer connections, block synchronization, RPC availability, and network logs.

## Key Features

### Decision Tree with Concrete Thresholds

**DISCONNECTED** (critical issues):
- RPC connection fails (daemon not running)
- Zero peers connected for >5 minutes
- Block height stalled for >30 minutes
- Critical errors: bind() failed, lock failed, database errors

**DEGRADED** (partial functionality):
- Peer count: 1-3 (below threshold of 4)
- Block lag: >10 blocks behind network
- High latency: Average peer ping >1000ms
- RPC slow: >2 seconds response time
- Frequent disconnects: >5 in 10 minutes

**HEALTHY** (all systems operational):
- Peer count: ≥4 connected
- Block lag: ≤2 blocks (synced)
- RPC responsive: <1 second
- Low latency: Average ping <500ms
- Stable connections: ≤2 disconnects in 10 minutes
- No critical log errors

### Monitoring Capabilities

1. **Peer Count Check**: `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo` with JSON parsing
2. **Block Sync Status**: Compares local height vs network tip (headers)
3. **RPC Availability**: Tests connectivity and measures response latency
4. **Network Latency**: Calculates average peer ping times
5. **Log Analysis**: Greps for critical errors, warnings, and disconnect patterns
6. **Connection Stability**: Tracks peer connect/disconnect frequency

### Tools Authorized

- **Bash**: Execute `bitcoin-cli` commands, measure timing, parse JSON
- **Grep**: Search debug.log for error patterns
- **Read**: Read configuration and log files

### Validation Evidence

✓ JSON syntax validated with Python json.tool
✓ All required fields present (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria)
✓ Decisions array defined with 3 options: healthy, degraded, disconnected
✓ Structure matches existing agent patterns (log_analyzer, performance_analyzer)
✓ Comprehensive system prompt (11,511 characters) with:
  - Complete decision tree with numeric thresholds
  - 6 monitoring tasks with bash commands and interpretations
  - Example scenarios for all 3 health states
  - Markdown report template with metrics and rationale
  - Special handling for regtest mode (0 peers acceptable)
✓ 7 validation criteria aligned with monitoring capabilities
✓ 4 example scenarios demonstrating each decision outcome
