ASSESSMENT: 

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding of the requirement to create a `network_monitor` agent JSON definition
- Correctly identified the need to follow existing agent architecture patterns
- Comprehensive list of monitoring checks: peer count, block height, network latency, RPC availability, log analysis
- Appropriate tool selection: Read, Grep, Bash
- Good edge case coverage in TEST_CONSIDERATIONS (daemon not running, partial connectivity, block height lag, RPC timeout)
- Logical step-by-step approach: examine existing patterns → search for similar agents → create new agent → verify

**Weaknesses:**
- Step 1 proposes reading `task_planner.json` and `proof_validator.json`, but these may not be the best examples for a monitoring agent. A better approach would be to search for agents that use similar tools or have similar monitoring/analysis purposes.
- The plan doesn't specify how to determine thresholds (e.g., "what peer count is 'degraded' vs 'disconnected'?", "how many blocks behind is acceptable?")
- Missing concrete specification of the decision tree logic in the APPROACH section (mentioned but not detailed)
- The EVIDENCE section says "Example of how the prompt instructs checking each health metric" but doesn't specify what format or detail level this example will have

**Clarity on Bitcoin Daemon Commands:**
- Plan mentions `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo` which is correct
- Could be more specific about other commands needed (e.g., `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `ping`)

**File Creation:**
- Correctly identifies this needs a new file (`agents/network_monitor.json`) which is appropriate since this is a new agent

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence is somewhat vague:
- "Complete file contents" - ✓ Good
- "Verification that JSON structure matches existing patterns" - Too vague. How will this be verified? Just visual inspection?
- "Confirmation that all required fields are present" - ✓ Acceptable
- "Example of how the prompt instructs checking each health metric" - Unclear what this means. An example output? Example agent execution? Just showing the prompt text?

**Missing Evidence:**
- No mention of validating the JSON syntax itself (e.g., running `jq` or similar)
- No specific proof that the decision tree logic is complete and handles all transitions between states
- No verification that the monitoring commands specified in the prompt actually work with a real Bitcoin daemon

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasons for Rejection:**

1. **Insufficient Evidence Specification**: The plan doesn't commit to concrete, verifiable proof that the agent will work correctly. "Example of how the prompt instructs checking each health metric" is too vague.

2. **Missing Critical Details**: The plan doesn't specify:
   - Exact threshold values for health classifications (peer count thresholds, block lag thresholds, latency thresholds)
   - Complete decision tree logic mapping metrics to health states
   - Specific Bitcoin RPC commands and their expected outputs
   - Specific log file paths and error patterns to grep for

3. **Weak Validation**: No plan to validate the JSON syntax or test that the monitoring logic is complete. Should include running the JSON through a validator or at minimum checking it can be parsed.

**Required Revisions:**

To earn approval, the plan should:
- Specify concrete threshold values for all health metrics
- Include a complete decision tree showing how combinations of metrics map to 'healthy'/'degraded'/'disconnected'
- List specific Bitcoin RPC commands with expected output formats
- Identify specific log file paths and error patterns
- Commit to validating JSON syntax with a tool
- Provide clearer evidence such as: "JSON file will be validated with `jq` command to ensure valid syntax" and "Decision tree will be documented showing all metric combinations and resulting states"
