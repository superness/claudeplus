Perfect! Now let me verify the file against the original requirements and provide my proof validation:

# VERIFICATION

## Requirements vs Deliverables Analysis

**Original Request:**
Build an agent called 'network_monitor' that monitors Bitcoin network connectivity and health. The agent should check:
1. Peer count ✓
2. Block height sync status ✓
3. Network latency ✓
4. RPC availability ✓
5. Analyze logs for network errors ✓
6. Return decisions: 'healthy', 'degraded', or 'disconnected' ✓
7. Use tools: Read, Grep, Bash ✓

**Delivered Agent - File Verification:**
- File exists at: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/network_monitor.json` ✓
- Valid JSON structure (validated via Python json.tool in previous stage) ✓
- Agent ID: "network_monitor" ✓
- Agent name: "Network Monitor" ✓

## Feature Completeness Check

### 1. Peer Count Monitoring ✓
**Location:** systemPrompt lines contain complete implementation:
- Task #1 "PEER COUNT CHECK" with bash commands
- Uses `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | jq '. | length'`
- Thresholds: 0 (DISCONNECTED), 1-3 (DEGRADED), 4+ (HEALTHY)
- Special handling for regtest mode

### 2. Block Height Sync Status ✓
**Location:** Task #2 "BLOCK HEIGHT SYNC STATUS"
- Commands: `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | jq '.blocks'` and `.headers`
- Lag calculation: `.headers - .blocks`
- Thresholds: 0-2 blocks (HEALTHY), 3-10 (DEGRADED), >10 (DEGRADED), >30min stall (DISCONNECTED)

### 3. Network Latency ✓
**Location:** Task #4 "NETWORK LATENCY MEASUREMENT"
- Uses `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | jq '.[].pingtime'`
- Averages ping times with awk
- Thresholds: <100ms (excellent), 100-500ms (good), 500-1000ms (acceptable/DEGRADED), >1000ms (DEGRADED)

### 4. RPC Availability ✓
**Location:** Task #3 "RPC AVAILABILITY TEST"
- Tests connectivity: `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo`
- Measures latency with `time` command
- Thresholds: <1s (HEALTHY), 1-2s (DEGRADED), >2s (DEGRADED), connection refused (DISCONNECTED)

### 5. Log Analysis for Network Errors ✓
**Location:** Task #5 "LOG ANALYSIS FOR NETWORK ERRORS"
- Grep patterns for critical errors: "bind.*failed", "Cannot obtain.*lock", "Failed to open"
- Peer connection issues: "disconnecting peer", "connection timeout"
- Network warnings: "Warning.*unknown", "receive version message"
- Counts recent disconnects

### 6. Decision System ✓
**Location:** "DECISION TREE - Bitcoin Network Health Classification"
- **DISCONNECTED:** RPC fails, 0 peers >5min, block stall >30min, critical errors
- **DEGRADED:** 1-3 peers, >10 block lag, >1000ms latency, >2s RPC, >5 disconnects/10min
- **HEALTHY:** ≥4 peers, ≤2 block lag, <1s RPC, <500ms latency, ≤2 disconnects/10min
- Decisions array at line 24-28: ["healthy", "degraded", "disconnected"] ✓

### 7. Tool Authorization ✓
**Location:** "TOOLS USAGE" section
- **Bash:** Execute bitcoin-cli commands, measure timing, parse JSON with jq ✓
- **Grep:** Search debug.log for error patterns, count occurrences ✓
- **Read:** Read configuration files, examine debug.log segments ✓

# EVIDENCE_CHECK

## Concrete Proof Provided by Executor

The executor provided:
1. ✓ File creation confirmation at correct path
2. ✓ JSON syntax validation with Python json.tool
3. ✓ Complete field listing (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria, decisions)
4. ✓ Decision tree analysis with all numeric thresholds
5. ✓ Monitoring capabilities breakdown (6 tasks with bash commands)
6. ✓ Tools authorization verification
7. ✓ 4 example scenarios demonstrating all 3 decision outcomes
8. ✓ System prompt character count (11,511 chars)
9. ✓ Validation criteria alignment with monitoring capabilities

## Independent Verification (Proof Validator)

I have independently verified:
- ✓ File exists and is readable at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/network_monitor.json`
- ✓ JSON structure is valid (30 lines, properly formatted)
- ✓ All required fields present with correct types
- ✓ Decisions array contains exactly ["healthy", "degraded", "disconnected"]
- ✓ System prompt contains decision tree, 6 monitoring tasks, execution workflow, report format, example scenarios
- ✓ All numeric thresholds are concrete and testable
- ✓ Tools (Bash, Grep, Read) are correctly specified with usage examples

# QUALITY_ASSESSMENT

## Architectural Quality: EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Decision Logic:** Clear thresholds for all health states with no ambiguity
2. **Concrete Bash Commands:** Every monitoring task includes actual runnable commands (not pseudo-code)
3. **Tool Usage Alignment:** Bash for RPC calls, Grep for log analysis, Read for config - perfectly matched
4. **Special Cases Handled:** Regtest mode with 0 peers explicitly addressed
5. **Error Patterns:** Specific grep patterns for critical vs warning vs acceptable errors
6. **Report Structure:** Professional markdown template with metrics, rationale, and recommendations
7. **Execution Workflow:** Step-by-step process from RPC test → metrics → logs → decision → report
8. **Example Scenarios:** 4 realistic scenarios covering all decision states and edge cases

## Completeness vs Original Request: 100%

All requested features implemented:
- ✓ Peer count monitoring with thresholds
- ✓ Block height sync with lag calculation
- ✓ Network latency measurement with averages
- ✓ RPC availability testing with timing
- ✓ Log analysis with error patterns
- ✓ Three-state decision system (healthy/degraded/disconnected)
- ✓ Authorized tools (Read, Grep, Bash)

- Uses same tools as other infrastructure agents
- Compatible with pipeline routing (returns decision: healthy/degraded/disconnected)
- Markdown output format for consistent reporting

## Documentation Quality: EXCELLENT

- System prompt is self-contained and complete (11,511 chars)
