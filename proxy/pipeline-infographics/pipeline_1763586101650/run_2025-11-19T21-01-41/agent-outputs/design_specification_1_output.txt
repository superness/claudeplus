UNDERSTANDING: User wants an agent definition JSON file for 'network_monitor' that monitors Bitcoin network health by checking peer connections, block synchronization, network latency, RPC availability, and analyzing logs. The agent should make decisions about network health status.

APPROACH: Create a JSON agent definition file following the existing agent architecture patterns in the codebase. The agent will use Read, Grep, and Bash tools to inspect Bitcoin daemon status, parse logs, and execute diagnostic commands to assess network connectivity.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine existing agent definitions in `agents/` directory (e.g., `agents/task_planner.json`, `agents/proof_validator.json`) to understand the JSON structure and format
2) Use Grep tool to search for any existing network or Bitcoin-related monitoring patterns: `grep -r "bitcoin\|network\|daemon" agents/`
3) Create new file `agents/network_monitor.json` with Write tool containing:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, purpose)
   - Prompt instructions detailing how to check peer count (via RPC or CLI commands like `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo`)
   - Instructions for block height verification (comparing local height vs network height)
   - Network latency checks (ping times to peers, RPC response times)
   - RPC availability tests (attempting connection to Bitcoin RPC endpoint)
   - Log analysis instructions (using Grep to find network errors, connection failures, timeout patterns)
   - Decision tree logic for classifying as 'healthy', 'degraded', or 'disconnected'
   - Allowed tools: Read, Grep, Bash
   - Decision options: healthy, degraded, disconnected
4) Use Read tool to verify the created JSON file is valid and complete

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: The agent definition will include instructions to handle:
- Edge case: Bitcoin daemon not running (should return 'disconnected')
- Edge case: Partial connectivity with some but not enough peers (should return 'degraded')
- Edge case: Block height significantly behind network (should return 'degraded')
- Edge case: RPC timeout or unavailability (should return 'disconnected')
- Normal case: Good peer count (>8), synced blocks, low latency (should return 'healthy')
- Log parsing for various error formats and connection issues
- Missing log files or empty responses

EVIDENCE: Will provide:
- The complete `agents/network_monitor.json` file contents
- Verification that JSON structure matches existing agent patterns
- Confirmation that all required fields are present (name, description, prompt, tools, decisions)
- Example of how the prompt instructs checking each health metric

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward agent definition creation task following established patterns in the codebase. The agent structure is well-documented in existing files, and the monitoring logic can be clearly defined using standard Bitcoin daemon commands and log analysis.
