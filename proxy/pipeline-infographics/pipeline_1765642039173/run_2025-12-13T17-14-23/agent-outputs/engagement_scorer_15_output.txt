## Summary

I've completed the engagement analysis for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe's progression system. Here are the key findings:

**Verdict: ENGAGING**

The progression system successfully transforms a simple tic-tac-toe game into a compelling long-term experience. Key strengths include:

- **Excellent reward density** - Every match yields tangible progress through XP, currencies, and streak bonuses
- **Multiple parallel tracks** - Account leveling, dual skill trees, collections, achievements, and seasonal content ensure players always have goals
- **Meaningful choices** - Faction identity (Orbis vs Crucia) and tree branching offer real aesthetic customization
- **Respect for player time** - Even losses reward 50 Essence, no match feels wasted
- **Pure cosmetic progression** - No pay-to-win mechanics protect competitive integrity

**Minor Concerns Identified:**

1. **Levels 70-85** represent a slight grind point where level-ups slow but major rewards are distant
2. **Prestige reset psychology** - Going from level 100 to level 1 may trigger loss aversion despite retained cosmetics
3. **Forced symbol variety** - Requiring 50 wins with each symbol for Awakened content may frustrate specialists
4. **FOMO elements** - Limited-time events create anxiety for casual players

**Integration Status:** The progression system aligns cleanly with both the economy design (currency earning rates match progression costs) and combat design (XP bonuses reinforce strategic play). No conflicts detected.

The system is ready for integration with minor tuning recommendations (add intermediate milestone rewards, display "Prestige X, Level Y" format, consider reducing Awakened win requirements).

DECISION: approved
