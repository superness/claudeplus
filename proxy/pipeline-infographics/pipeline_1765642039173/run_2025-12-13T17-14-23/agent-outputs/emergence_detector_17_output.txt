## Emergence Analysis Complete

**VERDICT: MINOR_ISSUES**

### Summary

I've analyzed all integrated systems for emergent behaviors. The design is solid overall, but I found one critical exploit that needs fixing:

### Critical Exploit Found: Streak Shield Farm
- **Mechanism:** Players can use Streak Shield (1 VF) + Void Novice AI (90% win rate) to trivially farm 15+ VF and Primordial Sparks
- **Impact:** Undermines the entire rare currency economy
- **Fix:** Require Grid Walker (1.0x difficulty) or higher AI for streak rewards (VF/AC/PS)

### Positive Emergent Behaviors Worth Keeping:
1. **"Draw Philosopher" playstyle** - The Eternal creates a Zen-like "perfect play" community
2. **"Awakened Grinder" identity** - Dual-mastery requirements create respected community members
3. **"Dual Affinity + Streak" timing** - Creates exciting "big play" moments

### Other Minor Issues:
- Alt account trading needs stronger mitigation (increase tax to 20%)
- Cap overflow behavior needs clarification
- Draw-specialists against The Eternal have no streak rewards (add draw streak)

### Edge Cases Identified:
- Cap collision when earning rewards
- Faction War timing exploits
- Seasonal achievement resets mid-progress

The design demonstrates strong system coherence. With the Streak Shield fix applied, the game is ready for balance auditing.
