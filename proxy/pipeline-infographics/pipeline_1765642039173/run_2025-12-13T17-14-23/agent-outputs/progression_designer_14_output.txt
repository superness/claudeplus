## Summary

I've created the **Progression Design Document** for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe, establishing a comprehensive advancement system that rewards engagement while preserving the game's elegant simplicity.

**Key Systems Designed:**

**Leveling System:** 100-level account progression using Cosmic Resonance (XP) earned from matches. The gentle exponential curve (~890 matches to max) ensures steady progress. A 10-tier Prestige system extends endgame with exclusive cosmetics and cumulative XP bonuses.

**Dual Skill Trees:** Parallel paths for Orbis (defensive/flowing aesthetics) and Crucia (aggressive/sharp aesthetics), each with 3 branches and 12 nodes. Completing both unlocks the Awakened Path for dual-force mastery. Total investment: 2,100 Orbs + 2,100 Shards + 26 Alignment Crystals.

**Gear Progression:** Five-tier symbol evolution (Basic → Legendary) for both O and X, plus tiered grid skins, victory effects, and profile items. Costs integrate with the economy document's pricing structure.

**Unlock Timeline:** Gradual feature access—basic gameplay at match 1, trading at 50, The Eternal AI at 200, Prestige at 500+.

**Milestones:** Regular celebration moments for matches played (10/50/100/500), wins (25/100/500), streaks (3/5/10+), and collection completion percentages.

**Combat Integration:** XP bonuses for strategic play (swift victories +50 CR, forks +25 CR, comebacks +35 CR) ensure skilled play accelerates progression.

**Endgame Systems:** Prestige cycling (10 levels), collection completion tracking, seasonal passes with 50 tiers, and mastery achievements keep veterans engaged indefinitely.

The system ensures every match contributes to meaningful progress while respecting the balance analysis findings—all progression is cosmetic, never affecting gameplay.
