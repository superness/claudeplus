## Summary

I've revised the Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe implementation to fix all critical issues identified in the technical validation:

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `output/src/app.js` - Application entry point that wires services with proper dependency injection

**Modified Files:**
- `output/src/config/index.js` - Fixed JWT to use HS256 algorithm with secure production requirements
- `output/src/services/AuthService.js` - Added Redis-based token blacklist, fixed JWT signing
- `output/src/services/GameService.js` - Fixed reward multiplier reference to use config
- `output/src/services/EconomyService.js` - Added currency name normalization (snake_case/camelCase)
- `output/src/api/authRoutes.js` - Converted to factory function pattern
- `output/src/api/gameRoutes.js` - Fixed route ordering (static routes before params), factory pattern
- `output/src/api/economyRoutes.js` - Converted to factory function pattern
- `output/src/api/progressionRoutes.js` - Converted to factory function pattern with stubs
- `output/src/api/cosmeticRoutes.js` - Converted to factory function pattern with stubs
- `output/src/api/tradingRoutes.js` - Converted to factory function pattern with stubs
- `output/src/api/middleware/auth.js` - Factory pattern with blacklist checking
- `output/package.json` - Changed redis to ioredis dependency
- `output/README.md` - Updated documentation

### Critical Fixes Applied

1. **Service Instantiation**: All routes now use factory functions receiving instantiated services
2. **Route Ordering**: `/matches/active` and `/matches/history` now defined before `/:matchId`
3. **JWT Security**: Changed from RS256 (requires RSA keys) to HS256 (symmetric), with production validation
4. **Token Blacklist**: Redis-based token revocation for secure logout
5. **Currency Names**: EconomyService normalizes both camelCase and snake_case currency names
