All tasks are complete. Let me provide a summary.

## Summary

I've generated and updated the implementation code for **Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe** in the `output/` directory. Here's what was created/modified:

### Files Modified

**`output/src/services/GameService.js`** - Fixed the **CRITICAL Streak Shield exploit**:
- Added `_calculateStreakRewards()` method with milestone-based rewards
- Implemented AI tier gating: Void Fragments, Alignment Crystals, and Primordial Sparks are ONLY awarded when playing against Grid Walker or higher AI tiers
- Bonus Cosmic Essence is still granted for lower tiers

**`output/src/services/index.js`** - Added exports for new services

**`output/README.md`** - Updated architecture docs and added Balance Safeguards section

**`output/src/tests/services.test.js`** - Added comprehensive tests for streak reward gating

### Files Created

**`output/src/services/ProgressionService.js`** (~350 lines):
- XP and level management with exponential curve
- Skill tree queries and node unlocking
- Achievement tracking with progressive achievements
- Reward claiming with currency cap enforcement
- Level-based unlock system

**`output/src/services/TradingService.js`** (~200 lines):
- Trading status with unlock requirements (50 matches)
- Trade execution with 10% tax
- Daily trade limits (5/day)
- Trade history queries
- Tradeable currency restrictions (only Orbs/Shards)

### Key Balance Safeguards Implemented

1. **Streak reward gating**: Rare currencies require Grid Walker+ AI
2. **Currency caps**: VF=200, AC=50, PS=10
3. **Trade limits**: 5/day, 10% tax, 5-50 amount range
4. **Level gating**: Trading unlocks at level 10, skill trees at level 5
