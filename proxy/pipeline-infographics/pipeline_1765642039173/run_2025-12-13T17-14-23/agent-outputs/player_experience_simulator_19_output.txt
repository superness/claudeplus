## Summary

**VERDICT: NEEDS_POLISH**

I've completed the player experience simulation for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe. The game delivers an excellent core experience with spectacular visuals and satisfying progression, but has notable UX friction that needs addressing before launch.

**Key Friction Points:**

1. **Tutorial/Onboarding Gaps (Critical)**
   - No explanation of faction choice (Orbis vs Crucia) at first match
   - Skill tree system unlocks at Match 10 with no guided tour
   - Currency purposes never explained
   - New players may churn before discovering the excellent mid/late game

2. **Transition Friction (High)**
   - Jump from Echoing Acolyte (70-80% wins) to Grid Walker (50% wins) feels abrupt
   - Loss streaks have no recovery messaging - players may feel demoralized
   - "Draw = success" messaging missing for Force Adept/The Eternal

3. **Prestige Anxiety (Medium-High)**
   - Level 100 players fear losing progress despite keeping cosmetics
   - No preview screen showing what Prestige 1 looks like vs current state
   - Decision paralysis prevents engagement with endgame loop

4. **Returning Player Issues (Medium)**
   - No "Welcome Back" summary after 7+ day absence
   - Unclear what changed, what's new, where to pick up
   - FOMO for missed seasonal content

**Engagement Peaks Working Well:**
- First Victory Cascade (spectacular!)
- First cosmetic unlock creates investment
- Win streak rewards create mini-goals
- Legendary purchases feel transformative

**Launch Readiness: 80%** (95% with critical fixes)

The core loop is excellent - players who survive the tutorial phase will have a fantastic experience. Priority must be improving early onboarding to ensure new players understand factions, skill trees, and currencies before churning out.
