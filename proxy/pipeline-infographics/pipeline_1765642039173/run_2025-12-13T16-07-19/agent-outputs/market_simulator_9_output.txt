## Summary

I've completed the economy simulation for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe and written the full report to `output/design-docs/economy-simulation.md`.

### Key Findings:

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Document Inconsistencies** - The Resource Design and Economy Design documents have conflicting numbers for win rewards (100E vs 150E), conversion ratios (50:1 vs 500:1 for Essence→Orbs), and streak rewards. These MUST be reconciled before implementation.

2. **Faction Currency Surplus** - Players earn ~140 Orbs/Shards daily but can only spend ~40-80. After 2 weeks, veterans will have 1,000+ of each with nothing to buy.

3. **Storage Cap Issues** - The 100 VF and 20 AC caps are too restrictive. Active players hit these caps and lose earned resources, creating frustration rather than urgency.

**What Works Well:**
- New player experience is generous (can afford 10+ items in first 50 matches)
- Core faucet/sink structure is sound
- Five-tier resource system maps well to cosmetic tiers
- Casual players still feel rewarded (~3 weeks to first rare)

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize reward numbers across documents
- Add faction currency sinks (prestige system, crafting recipes)
- Raise VF cap to 200, AC cap to 50
- Add endgame Essence sinks (cosmetic upgrades)

The economy is fundamentally solid but needs these tuning passes before the combat system can safely feed into it.
