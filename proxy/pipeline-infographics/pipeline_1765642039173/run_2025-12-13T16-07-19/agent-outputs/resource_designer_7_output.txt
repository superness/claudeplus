## Summary

I've created the resource design document for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe, establishing a five-tier currency system that rewards engagement while honoring the game's simplicity.

**Resource Tiers:**

1. **Cosmic Essence** (Common) - Base currency from all matches; unlimited storage
2. **Orbs & Shards** (Uncommon) - Faction-aligned currencies earned by playing O or X respectively
3. **Void Fragments** (Rare) - Win streak rewards, capped at 100
4. **Alignment Crystals** (Epic) - Earned by completing both faction challenges, capped at 20
5. **Primordial Sparks** (Legendary) - Ultimate currency from achievements and rare drops, capped at 10

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Every match rewards resources—victories give more, but defeats aren't wasted time
- Playing both symbols (O and X) creates a more balanced resource profile
- Caps on rare currencies create urgency to spend/craft
- All resources unlock cosmetic enhancements, not gameplay power
- Conversion paths allow players to trade up toward higher tiers

**Cultural Integration:**

The Orbs/Shards split reinforces the Orbis/Crucia cultural divide. Players naturally accumulate their faction's currency, while Alignment Crystals reward those who embrace both forces—mirroring the "Awakened" individuals mentioned in the culture design.

**Economy Flow:**

Resources funnel into spectacular visual upgrades: symbol trails, cell animations, grid skins, and victory effects. A casual player earning ~1,200 Essence daily can unlock common cosmetics in 5 matches, while legendary items require weeks of play—creating meaningful long-term goals without pay-to-win concerns.
