## Balance Analysis Summary

**Verdict: BALANCED**

The combat system for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe is well-designed. Key findings:

**Strengths:**
- Core tic-tac-toe rules remain pure—no gameplay modifications that could break mathematical balance
- Reward multipliers (0.5× for Novice up to 2.0× for The Eternal) correctly incentivize harder AI opponents
- Cosmetic-only progression means no pay-to-win or power creep concerns
- Impact Score system rewards skill without affecting outcomes
- Draw mechanics celebrate stalemates rather than punishing them

**Minor Issues Identified:**
1. **Streak Shield** is slightly undercosted (1 VF)—recommend increasing to 2 VF
2. **Alignment Crystal** drop rate (0.5%) may feel grindy—recommend doubling to 1%
3. **Void Novice farming** could be reduced by lowering multiplier from 0.5× to 0.3×

**No Exploits Found:**
- No infinite resource loops exist
- Streak rewards cannot be trivially farmed due to multipliers
- Dual Affinity is balanced by Alignment Crystal rarity

**Difficulty Curve:** Smooth progression from 90%+ win rate (early) to near-impossible wins against The Eternal (mastery). Player skill development aligns with AI challenge escalation.

The system honors the game's simplicity while making progression meaningful.
