## Summary

I've created the combat design document for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe, transforming the classic tic-tac-toe into a spectacular cosmic duel system.

**Core Combat Framework:**
- Turn-based strategic duel with 5-9 turns per match
- The Sacred Grid maps to strategic values: Nexus Core (center) = highest value, Anchor Points (corners) = high, Bridge Cells (edges) = medium
- Four-phase turn structure: Channeling Focus → Symbol Manifestation → Resonance Check → Power Buildup

**Impact Score System:**
Instead of HP/damage, combat uses "Cosmic Impact Scores" that determine visual intensity:
- Fork creation (+50%), blocking (+25%), center control (+30%)
- Swift victory (5 moves) = 2.5× multiplier
- Scores drive particle explosions, screen shake, and music crescendo

**AI Bestiary (5 Tiers):**
- Void Novice (random) → Grid Walker (minimax) → The Eternal (perfect play)
- Special event opponents tied to faction mastery
- Clear win rate expectations per tier

**Cosmetic Ability System:**
- Five-tier symbol evolution (Basic → Legendary) for both O and X
- Resource-purchased visual enhancements (trails, slashes, victory effects)
- No gameplay power—all cosmetic differentiation

**Resource Integration:**
- Consumables (Essence Amplifier, Streak Shield, Dual Affinity) activate pre-match
- Victory/draw/defeat all reward resources at different rates
- Streak bonuses escalate from 3-win to 15-win with guaranteed Void Fragment drops

**Spectacular Visual Design:**
- Detailed cell claim sequences for both factions
- Victory Line Cascade (6-step animation)
- Draw creates "Stalemate Storm" with balanced dual-force explosion
