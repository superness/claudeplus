## Summary

I've created a lore framework for "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid" that transforms the simple game into an epic cosmic ritual.

**Core Concept**: Two primordial forces—Orbis (the Circle/O) and Crucia (the Cross/X)—wage an eternal battle on the Sacred Grid. Players become avatars channeling these cosmic entities.

**Key Elements**:
- **Orbis**: Represents cycles, completion, harmony. Azure/cool visual theme with orbital effects.
- **Crucia**: Represents intersection, action, transformation. Crimson/warm visual theme with slashing effects.
- **The Sacred Grid**: Nine cells of pure cosmic potential that transform spectacularly when claimed.

**Visual Justification**: The lore provides rich context for spectacular graphics:
- Symbol placements trigger cosmic awakening animations
- Winning three-in-a-row creates devastating energy beams
- Draws cause balanced explosions of both forces
- Every turn increases ambient particle intensity

**Mythology**: Simple prophecies ("When three align, a universe is born or dies") give weight to gameplay without complexity. The eternal struggle ensures neither force truly wins—the game always continues.

This framework keeps the core tic-tac-toe mechanics pure while making every move feel like a universe-shaping event worthy of spectacular visual treatment.
