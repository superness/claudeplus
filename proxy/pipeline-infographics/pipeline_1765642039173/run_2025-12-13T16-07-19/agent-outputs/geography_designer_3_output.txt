## Summary

I've created a geography design document that adapts traditional world-building concepts to the unique spatial context of a cosmic tic-tac-toe game.

**World Structure**: The Sacred Grid is a metaphysical arena floating in the void between universes. Rather than continents, the geography consists of nine distinct cosmic zones—the Holy Nonad—each with unique visual characteristics (stellar nurseries, void bridges, galaxy arms, dark matter wells, and a central Nexus Core).

**Regional Design**:
- **Four Corners** (cells 1,3,7,9): Maximum strategic value with 3 alignment paths each. Visually distinct—spiral nebula, supernova remnant, gravity well, and quasar point.
- **Nexus Core** (cell 5): The center of all power controlling 4 alignment paths, featuring intense pulsing energy.
- **Four Gates** (cells 2,4,6,8): Edge positions as void bridges connecting corners.

**Climate System**: "Weather" manifests as escalating visual intensity—from calm starfield at game start to energy storms as more symbols are placed, culminating in victory cascades or draw tempests.

**Resources**: Strategic power mapped to cell positions. Corners offer maximum potential, the center offers control, edges offer blocking utility. Visual resources include star particles, nebula wisps, energy crystals, and cosmic dust.

**Environmental Storytelling**: Each cell transformation reflects the claiming force—Orbis creates smooth orbital animations in cool blues, while Crucia slashes with sharp crimson impacts. The surrounding void deepens as matches intensify.

**Animation Timing**: "Travel times" translate to visual effect durations—symbol placement takes ~1.5-2 seconds of satisfying animation, while victory beams build over 2+ seconds for maximum spectacle.

The geography justifies spectacular graphics while teaching strategy through visual hierarchy.
