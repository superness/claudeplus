## Summary

I've created a comprehensive revised economy design document (v2.0) for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe that addresses all critical issues identified by the market simulator.

**Key Changes Made:**

1. **Standardized All Numbers**: Reconciled conflicting values between Resource Design and the original Economy Design. Win rewards are now 100E/50E/75E, and conversion rates follow the Resource Design (500E:10 Orbs, 100 Orbs:1 VF).

2. **Added Faction Currency Sinks**: New systems to absorb Orbs/Shards surplus:
   - Faction Prestige Tiers (200 units per tier, 5 tiers)
   - Faction Exclusive Crafting (150-250 units)
   - Event Entry Fees (50-100 units)
   - Cosmetic Upgrade Kits (100 units)
   - Awakened Sanctum now uses dual currency instead of Alignment Crystals

3. **Raised Storage Caps**: VF increased from 100 to 200, AC from 20 to 50 to reduce frustration without eliminating scarcity psychology.

4. **Added Essence Prestige Sinks**: The Prestige Workshop lets veterans spend 5k-50k Essence to add visual enhancements to owned cosmetics, solving the endgame Essence surplus.

5. **Clarified Streak Rewards**: Explicitly documented as cumulative (5-win streak = 3 total VF).

6. **Balanced Legendary Pricing**: Profile items raised from 1 PS to 2 PS for tier consistency.

7. **Added Seasonal Achievements**: Repeatable rewards each season for veterans who completed one-time achievements.

The economy now has proper faucet/sink balance across all player archetypes while maintaining the spectacular cosmetic reward system that fits the "super graphics" vision.
