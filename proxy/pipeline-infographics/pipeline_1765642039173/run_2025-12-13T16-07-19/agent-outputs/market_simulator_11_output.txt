## Summary

**VERDICT: APPROVED**

The economy simulation for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe v2.0 is complete. The revised economy design successfully addresses all critical issues from the previous simulation:

**Key Findings:**
- **No exploitable loops** - Win trading, conversion loops, and multi-account farming are all blocked by existing safeguards
- **Healthy progression** across all player types (new, mid-game, veteran)
- **Sinks properly balance faucets** - Prestige Workshop absorbs Essence surplus, Faction Prestige Tiers handle Orb/Shard accumulation
- **Raised caps (200 VF, 50 AC)** eliminate frustration without destroying scarcity

**Minor Recommendations** (non-blocking):
- Add mid-season milestone (25 wins = 1 VF) for casual retention
- Monitor faction currency velocity post-launch

The economy is ready for combat system integration.

DECISION: approved
