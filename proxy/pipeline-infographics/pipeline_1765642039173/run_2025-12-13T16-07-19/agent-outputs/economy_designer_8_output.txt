## Summary

I've created the economy design document for Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe, establishing a complete marketplace ecosystem built around the five-tier resource system.

**Market Systems:**

- **Cosmic Bazaar**: Main shop with daily rotation (6 items), permanent catalog, and faction-specific vendors
- **Transmutation Forge**: Resource conversion with strategic cooldowns (500 Essence → 1 Orb, etc.)
- **Player Trading**: Limited to Orbs/Shards only, with 10% tax and 5 daily trades to prevent exploitation

**Pricing Structure:**

Cosmetics are priced by category and rarity. Symbol Trails range from 800 Essence (common) to 2 Primordial Sparks (legendary). Grid Skins—the most visible customization—command premium prices at 1,500E to 3PS. Dynamic events include weekly sales, faction wars, and monthly legendary discounts.

**Economic Flow:**

Players earn ~1,200 Essence daily from matches, with wins rewarding 150E + 3 faction currency and defeats still giving 50E + 1. Win streaks generate Void Fragments, and daily challenges award Alignment Crystals for completing all objectives. Money sinks include purchases, conversion taxes (5%), trading taxes (10%), and aspirational items requiring multiple Primordial Sparks.

**Inflation Prevention:**

Resource caps (100 VF, 20 AC, 10 PS) prevent hoarding. Conversion cooldowns slow advancement. Limited stock on rare items creates FOMO without pay-to-win. The system targets a slight daily deficit to encourage continued engagement.

**Player Progression:**

New players (0-50 matches) can afford 5-10 common cosmetics. Regular players (200 matches) can chase their first Epic. Veterans (500+ matches) work toward complete collections and legendary exclusives.
