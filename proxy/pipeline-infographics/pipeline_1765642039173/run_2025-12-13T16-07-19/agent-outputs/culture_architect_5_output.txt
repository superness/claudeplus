## Summary

I've created the culture design document for "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid" that establishes two rich, contrasting societies aligned with the game's primordial forces.

**The Order of Orbis** (Circle channelers):
- Contemplative society valuing patience, cycles, and completion
- Governed by consensus circles—decisions ripple outward until all agree
- Ranked in "Spheres of Influence" from Seedlings to The Completion
- Trade in Orbs (crystallized draw energy), prefer circular exchange
- Taboos include breaking circles, rushing moves, or celebrating opponent's defeat
- Azure/silver visual identity with flowing, curved movement

**The Crusade of Crucia** (Cross channelers):
- Dynamic society valuing decisiveness, action, and transformation
- Meritocratic governance—anyone can challenge superiors to matches
- Ranked in "Cross-Ranks" achieved through performance, not birth
- Trade in Shards (victory beam fragments), prefer direct barter
- Taboos include hesitation, curved movement, and refusing challenges
- Crimson/gold visual identity with sharp, angular gestures

**Inter-Cultural Relations**:
- Mutual respect as "worthy adversaries in the eternal dance"
- Recognition of fundamental interdependence—neither can exist alone
- The Sacred Grid serves as neutral ground where tensions become productive play
- Rare "Awakened" individuals who channel both forces are viewed with suspicion and reverence

The cultures justify gameplay styles (defensive vs. aggressive openings), visual themes (cool harmonics vs. sharp impacts), and provide hooks for potential narrative expansion while honoring the elegant simplicity of tic-tac-toe.
