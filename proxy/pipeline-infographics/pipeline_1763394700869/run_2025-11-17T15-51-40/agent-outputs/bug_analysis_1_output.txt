  "bugSummary": "Ship movement completely non-functional - navigation targets set but ship doesn't move at all",
  "expectedBehavior": "When tapping an object or double-tapping a location, the ship should begin moving toward the target, reaching 50% max velocity in approximately 0.5-1 seconds (EVE-style exponential acceleration curve)",
  "actualBehavior": "Navigation targets are correctly set (UI shows target selected), but the ship remains stationary. No visible movement occurs for any navigation method (tap object, double-tap location, or manual navigation)",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship_movement", "navigation", "physics", "ship_fitting"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser (index.html)",
    "Step 2: Wait for ship to spawn in space",
    "Step 3: Tap any nearby object (asteroid, station, anomaly) to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe ship UI shows target is set but ship does not move",
    "Step 5: Alternatively, double-tap empty space to navigate to location",
    "Step 6: Observe ship still does not move at all"

  "hypothesis": "Recent commit 094f3c4 ('Fix radial HUD spacing and scene rendering bugs, enhance automation testing') attempted to fix a bug where ship movement would break after fitting items and undocking. The fix likely introduced changes to the ship physics initialization or stat synchronization between Ship.js and ShipPhysics.js. The previous bug analysis identified a formula error in Ship.js line 82 where timeConstant calculation used incorrect scaling (agility/5 instead of agility/5000000), causing the time constant to be 1,000,000x too large. This makes the exponential acceleration curve so slow that movement appears completely broken - the ship is technically moving but at an imperceptibly slow rate (taking 11 minutes to reach 50% speed instead of 0.5 seconds)."
