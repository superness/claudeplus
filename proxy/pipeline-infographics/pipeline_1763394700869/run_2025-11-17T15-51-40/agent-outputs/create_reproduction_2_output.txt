Excellent! The reproduction script is ready. Let me create a summary document:

## Ship Movement Bug Reproduction Script Created

**Script Location:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`

### What the Script Tests

The script reproduces the critical bug where ship movement is completely non-functional after recent changes to fix the "movement breaks after fitting" bug.

### Test Sequence

1. **List Commands** - Verifies automation framework is working
2. **Get Initial Ship State** - Captures baseline position/velocity (should be stationary)
3. **Set Navigation Target** - Uses `setNavigationTarget` command to navigate to (5000, 0, 5000)
4. **Wait 2 Seconds** - Allows time for ship to accelerate
5. **Check Velocity** - **BUG DETECTION**: If speed < 1.0 m/s, bug is reproduced
6. **Wait 3 More Seconds** - Additional confirmation time
7. **Final Velocity Check** - If speed < 50 m/s after 5s total, confirms bug

### Expected Results

**If Bug Exists (Before Fix):**
- Navigation target sets successfully (UI shows target)
- Ship velocity remains near zero (< 1 m/s after 2 seconds)
- Speed stays negligible (< 50 m/s after 5 seconds)
- Script outputs: "🐛 BUG REPRODUCED"
- Exit code: 0

**If Bug Fixed (After Fix):**
- Navigation target sets successfully
- Ship accelerates normally (> 10 m/s after 2 seconds)
- Ship reaches normal speed (> 50 m/s after 5 seconds)
- Script outputs: "✅ All tests passed - bug NOT reproduced"
- Exit code: 0

### How to Run

```bash
# Make sure http-server is running on port 8080
npm start

# In another terminal, run the reproduction script
node reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js
```

The script will:
1. Start WebSocket automation server on port 8765
2. Launch Chrome with the game in test mode
3. Execute the test sequence automatically
4. Save evidence to `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
5. Exit with results

### Evidence File

The script saves a JSON evidence file containing:
- All commands executed
- All responses received
- Initial ship state
- Ship state after 2 seconds
- Ship state after 5 seconds
- Bug detection results
- Root cause analysis (if bug reproduced)

### Commands Used

The script uses these **available** automation commands from GameTestingInterface.js:
- ✅ `listCommands` - Verify automation framework
- ✅ `getShipState` - Get ship position/velocity/stats
- ✅ `setNavigationTarget` - Set navigation target (x, y, z coordinates)
- ✅ `wait` (custom) - Wait for time to pass

All commands are confirmed to exist in the automation framework.
