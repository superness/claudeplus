## Root Cause Summary

**The bug was introduced in commit 094f3c4** when fixing "movement breaks after fitting items":

### What the fix was trying to do:
- Add `syncStatsFromFitting()` to ensure fitted modules affect ship performance
- Call this function every frame to keep physics stats synchronized

### What went wrong:
- The timeConstant recalculation used the wrong formula: `agility / 5`
- The correct formula (from ShipPhysics.js) is: `agility / 5000000`
- This made the time constant **1,000,000x too large**

### Mathematical impact:
```
Atron agility = 3,456,000 (mass × inertiaModifier)

BROKEN: τ = 3,456,000 / 5 = 691,200 seconds
CORRECT: τ = 3,456,000 / 5,000,000 = 0.6912 seconds

Acceleration curve: V(t) = V_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ))

BROKEN: Ship reaches 50% speed in ~11.5 minutes
CORRECT: Ship reaches 50% speed in ~0.5 seconds
```

### Why it was hard to debug:
1. ✅ No JavaScript errors (calculations run without throwing exceptions)
2. ✅ Commands succeed (WebSocket returns success:true)
3. ✅ Ship is technically moving (just imperceptibly slowly)
4. ✅ Only visible through state inspection (WebSocket automation was critical)

### Fix status:
The fix has already been applied to Ship.js (line 82 changed to use `/5000000`), but **NOT committed** to git. The modified file shows the correct formula.
