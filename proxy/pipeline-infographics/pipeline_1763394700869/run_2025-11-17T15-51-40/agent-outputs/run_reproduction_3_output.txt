Perfect. Now let me create a summary of what happened:

## Reproduction Test Execution Report

### Test Execution Status: FRAMEWORK_ERROR

The reproduction script successfully:
- ✅ Started WebSocket automation server on port 8765
- ✅ Launched Chrome browser with game in testMode
- ✅ Game connected to automation server
- ✅ Waited 5 seconds for game initialization
- ✅ Sent `getShipState` command to game

The reproduction script FAILED because:
- ❌ Game received the command but did not send a response back
- ❌ Test script timed out waiting for response
- ❌ Cannot proceed with movement testing without working command infrastructure

### Evidence Collected

**File:** `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763394915620.json`

The evidence shows the command was sent but no response was received:
```json
{
  "command": "getShipState",
  "response": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": {...}  // Echo of the command, not a response
  },
  "status": "COMMAND_FAILED"
}
```

### Framework Error Analysis

The WebSocket automation framework has a **communication issue** where:
1. Test script → WebSocket server → Browser: ✅ WORKING
2. Browser → WebSocket server → Test script: ❌ NOT WORKING

Likely causes:
- `GameTestingInterface.handleCommand()` may not be returning responses correctly
- `TestingBrowserBridge.sendResponse()` may not be sending messages back
- Response messages may not be forwarded through the WebSocket server correctly

### Bug Status

Despite the framework error preventing runtime verification:

**Root Cause:** ✅ CONFIRMED via static code analysis
- **File:** js/entities/Ship.js:82
- **Error:** Wrong formula `agility / 5` instead of `agility / 5000000`
- **Impact:** Ship movement 1,000,000x slower than intended

**Fix:** ✅ READY
- Correct formula has been identified and documented
- Fix was provided in the [classify_request] stage

**Verification:** ⚠️ BLOCKED
- Automated test cannot complete due to framework error
- Alternative in-browser test page created: `test-ship-movement-simple.html`
- Manual testing required to confirm fix works

### Alternative Test Method

Created `test-ship-movement-simple.html` which:
- Runs tests directly in the browser
- Bypasses WebSocket framework
- Uses GameTestingInterface directly
- Provides visual feedback of test results

**Usage:**
1. Open `http://localhost:8080/?testMode=true`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/test-ship-movement-simple.html` in another tab
3. Click "Run Test" button
4. Observe results

### Files Created

1. ✅ `reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js` - Original reproduction script (blocked by framework)
2. ✅ `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763394915620.json` - Evidence of framework error
3. ✅ `test-ship-movement-simple.html` - Alternative in-browser test
4. ✅ `run_ship_movement_test.sh` - Helper script to run tests
5. ✅ `SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_REPORT.md` - Detailed analysis report

### Conclusion

The reproduction test **could not complete execution** due to a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** in the WebSocket automation system. However:

- Root cause identified with HIGH confidence through static code analysis
- Fix is ready and waiting to be applied
- Alternative test method created for manual verification
- Bug impact is severe (ship movement completely non-functional)

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
