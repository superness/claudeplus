Investigate why fitting items breaks ship controls, identify the root cause, and fix it so that fitted items work properly without disabling ship movement.",

This is a critical bug affecting core gameplay functionality. The ship fitting system is inadvertently disabling ship movement controls when items are fitted and the player undocks. This requires investigation of the ship fitting save/restore logic and how it interacts with the ship's physics and control systems.
