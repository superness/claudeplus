Based on my analysis of the CoiniumServ mining pool software, I can verify the following dependencies:

## Dependencies Verification Summary

### ✅ FOUND - Required Software:
1. **Mono Runtime**: Version 6.8.0.105 (Debian) - CONFIRMED
   - Location: `/usr/bin/mono`
   - This is the critical runtime needed to execute the compiled .NET executable

2. **Compiled Executable**: CoiniumServ.exe - CONFIRMED
   - Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe`
   - Size: 453KB
   - Ready to run

3. **systemd**: CONFIRMED
   - Location: `/usr/bin/systemctl`
   - Available for creating system services with automatic restart/recovery

4. **Network Ports**: AVAILABLE
   - Port 3333 (Stratum mining): Available
   - Port 81 (Web interface): Available

### ✅ Configuration Files:
1. Main config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json`
2. Pool config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json`
3. Stratum configuration verified with bind address `0.0.0.0:3333`

### 🔍 Code Analysis:
- **SocketServer.cs** (lines 147-152): Contains socket binding error handling with fatal logging
- **StratumServer.cs** (lines 97-103): Implements the Listen() method that starts Stratum service
- Current implementation logs fatal errors on port binding failures but does NOT have automatic recovery

### ❌ MISSING - For Enhanced Reliability:
1. **MSBuild/dotnet**: Not found (optional - executable already compiled)
2. **Automatic Recovery Mechanism**: Not implemented in current codebase
3. **Service Management Scripts**: No startup scripts found

### System Capabilities:
- OS: Linux (WSL2) on kernel 6.6.87.2
- Platform: amd64
- Service manager: systemd available for auto-restart functionality

## Conclusion:
All **critical dependencies** for running the mining pool server are present and accessible. The Mono runtime can execute the compiled CoiniumServ.exe. However, automatic recovery for Stratum port binding issues needs to be implemented through systemd service configuration with restart policies, as the current codebase only logs fatal errors without recovery mechanisms.
