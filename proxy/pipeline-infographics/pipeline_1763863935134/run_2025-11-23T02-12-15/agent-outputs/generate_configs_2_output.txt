Perfect! I have successfully generated all configuration files for the complete mining infrastructure with automatic recovery for Stratum port binding issues.

## Generated Configuration Files

### 1. **coiniumserv.service** - systemd Service Configuration
Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/coiniumserv.service`

Features:
- Automatic restart on failure (up to 5 times in 5 minutes)
- Pre-start port cleanup using `fuser -k 3333/tcp`
- Resource limits (65536 file descriptors, 4096 processes)
- systemd journal logging
- Runs from the Debug build directory

### 2. **scripts/start-pool.sh** - Startup Script with Port Recovery
Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/scripts/start-pool.sh`

Features:
- Automatic detection and cleanup of stale processes
- Port conflict resolution (kills processes on ports 3333 and 81)
- Retry logic (5 attempts with 10-second delays)
- Configuration file validation
- Color-coded logging output
- Root permission verification

### 3. **scripts/monitor-pool.sh** - Health Monitoring Script
Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/scripts/monitor-pool.sh`

Features:
- Process status checking
- Port listening verification (Stratum 3333, Web 81)
- Active connection counting
- Disk space monitoring
- Log file size tracking
- Continuous monitoring mode with optional auto-restart
- Email alert support (configurable)

### 4. **scripts/install-service.sh** - Installation Script
Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/scripts/install-service.sh`

Features:
- Automated service installation
- Prerequisite checking (systemd, mono, utilities)
- Permission configuration
- Service enablement for auto-start on boot
- Status reporting
- Uninstall functionality
- Reinstall option

### 5. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive Documentation
Location: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/DEPLOYMENT.md`

Includes:
- Quick start guide
- Architecture overview
- Automatic recovery features explanation
- Service management commands
- Health monitoring usage
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations
- Production deployment checklist

## Automatic Recovery Mechanisms

The infrastructure implements multiple layers of automatic recovery:

1. **systemd Level**: Service automatically restarts on failure
2. **Pre-start Level**: Ports are freed before each startup attempt
3. **Startup Script Level**: Retries with exponential backoff for port binding
4. **Process Level**: Stale process cleanup before starting
5. **Monitoring Level**: Optional continuous health checks with auto-restart

## Installation Instructions

To deploy the mining infrastructure:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ
sudo ./scripts/install-service.sh install
```

The pool server will be accessible on:
- **Stratum Port**: 3333 (for miner connections)
- **Web Interface**: Port 81 (for monitoring)

All configuration files have been successfully created and are ready for deployment.
