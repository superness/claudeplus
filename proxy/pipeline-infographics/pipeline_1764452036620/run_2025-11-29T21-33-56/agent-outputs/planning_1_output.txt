UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to read the AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md document and use it as a blueprint to build out the Super Axe Coin (AXE) cryptocurrency project in the specified directory. Based on the git status, there are already some files present (CMakeLists.txt, various source files in src/, contrib/, test/) but they may need to be completed or modified according to the spec.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the specification document to understand the complete requirements
2. Analyze existing files to see what's already implemented
3. Create a detailed implementation plan based on the spec requirements
4. Implement missing components and complete partial implementations

STEPS:
1) Read `/mnt/c/github/superaxecoin/doc/AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` to understand the full specification
2) Explore existing codebase structure using Glob to find all current files
3) Read key existing files to understand current implementation state:
   - `CMakeLists.txt` - build configuration
   - `src/chainparams.h` - chain parameters
   - `src/consensus/consensus.h` - consensus rules
   - `src/pow.h` - proof of work algorithm
   - `src/version.h` - version information
4) Compare spec requirements against existing implementation
5) Create todo list of all components that need to be:
   - Created from scratch
   - Modified/completed
   - Verified as complete
6) Implement each component according to spec:
   - Core blockchain parameters
   - LWMA difficulty algorithm
   - Genesis block configuration
   - Network ports and seeds
   - Wallet/CLI/daemon components
7) Verify build configuration in CMakeLists.txt covers all source files
8) Review test files in test/functional/ for completeness

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify all chain parameters match spec (block time, rewards, halving schedule)
- Confirm LWMA difficulty algorithm is correctly implemented
- Check genesis block hash matches expected values
- Validate network configuration (ports, magic bytes, prefixes)
- Ensure all required executables can be built (superaxecoind, superaxecoin-cli, superaxecoin-tx, superaxecoin-wallet)
- Test that functional tests in test/functional/ cover key features

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide contents of specification document
- Will show comparison between spec requirements and implemented code
- Will demonstrate all source files are properly structured
- Will verify CMakeLists.txt includes all necessary source files
- Will confirm all chain parameters in code match specification values

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can see files exist but need to read the spec to understand full requirements and verify completeness. The presence of untracked files suggests initial structure is in place but may need completion.
