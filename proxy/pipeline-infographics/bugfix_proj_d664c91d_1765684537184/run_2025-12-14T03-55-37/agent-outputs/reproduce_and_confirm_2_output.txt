The bug is not reproducing in our test. This could mean:
1. The bug was already fixed in the current codebase
2. The bug requires very specific conditions we haven't matched
3. The bug is intermittent or race condition based

Let me write a final summary report:

## Bug Reproduction & Confirmation

### Test Created

### Test Run Output

=== CAPTURED ERRORS ===
NO ERRORS CAPTURED

✓ BUG NOT REPRODUCED: No Three.js errors observed
=======================


### VERDICT: BUG NOT REPRODUCED ###
Test completed without triggering the rendering bug.
  ✓  1 [chromium] › tests/reproduce-bug.spec.ts:3:1 › reproduce three.js rendering bug after killing cultist (12.6s)

  1 passed (28.5s)
```

### What I Observed
The test successfully:
- Loaded the game and initialized test hooks
- Spawned 3 Cultist enemies at different positions
- Reduced one cultist's health to 1 HP
- Dealt a killing blow (100 damage) with THERMAL damage type
- Confirmed the cultist died (health: 0, alive: false)
- Waited for loot spawn and render frames (2.5 seconds total)
- Monitored for Three.js errors during and after the death sequence

However, NO errors were captured during or after the enemy death and loot spawn sequence.

### Verdict
**BUG NOT REPRODUCED** - The test ran clean with no Three.js rendering errors.

The expected error was:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')
    at refreshUniformsCommon (three.js:16544:25)
    at Object.refreshMaterialUniforms (three.js:16497:7)
    at setProgram (three.js:18074:19)
    at WebGLRenderer.renderBufferDirect (three.js:17369:23)
```

This error did not occur when killing a Cultist and spawning loot orbs.

**Possible explanations:**
1. The bug may have already been fixed in the current codebase
2. The bug requires very specific conditions not replicated in this test (specific enemy type combinations, specific timing, specific game state)
3. The bug may be a race condition that doesn't always trigger
4. The bug might require user interaction or specific camera angles
5. The bug might be related to accumulated state over a longer play session

DECISION: bug_not_reproduced
