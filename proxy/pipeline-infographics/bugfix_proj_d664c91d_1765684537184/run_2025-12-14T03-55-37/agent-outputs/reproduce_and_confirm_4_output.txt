The bug is NOT being reproduced. The cultist died (`Enemy Cultist died`, `Loot Generated 3 drops`), and the render loop ran for many frames afterward, but no Three.js errors occurred.

## Bug Reproduction & Confirmation

### Test Created
Files:
- `tests/reproduce-cultist-death-bug.spec.ts`
- `tests/reproduce-cultist-exact-scenario.spec.ts`

### Test Run Output
Both tests successfully:
1. Spawned a Cultist enemy in a combat scenario
2. Spawned multiple additional enemies (Chaos Marines, Possessed, Orks) to match the bug report conditions
3. Killed the Cultist, triggering loot generation
4. Monitored the render loop for 3-5 seconds after death
5. Captured all console errors and page errors

**Console logs confirm:**
```
[Enemy] Cultist took 35 damage (15 -> 0)
[Loot] Enemy Cultist died - Threat tier: MINORIS
[Loot] Generated 3 drops
```

**Error capture results:**
```
Total errors: 0
Three.js rendering errors: 0
NO THREE.JS ERRORS OBSERVED
```

### What I Observed
The Cultist was successfully killed during combat, loot orbs were spawned, and the render loop continued running for several seconds. No Three.js `refreshUniformsCommon` errors were captured despite monitoring for them specifically.

### Verdict
**BUG NOT REPRODUCED** - The test was able to kill a Cultist and trigger loot generation, but the Three.js rendering error did not occur. The bug may require specific conditions not captured in the automated test environment, such as:
- Specific timing/race conditions with frame rendering
- Particular enemy death animations or visual effects states
- Specific material/shader combinations that only occur in certain scenarios
- Environmental factors in the full game that aren't present in the test scenario
