Excellent! Now I have all the information needed. The bug is clear:

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **StationUI.js line 885**: `this.currentShipId = 'player_ship_1'`
- **ShipFittingManager.js line 19**: `this.playerShipId = 'player'`

The ship IDs don't match! When `autoFitItem()` calls `getShipFitting(this.currentShipId)` with `'player_ship_1'`, it returns `undefined` because the ship fitting was initialized with the ID `'player'`.

  "hypothesis": "StationUI's FittingServiceUI class uses hardcoded ship ID 'player_ship_1' (line 885) but ShipFittingManager initializes the player ship with ID 'player' (line 19). When autoFitItem() calls getShipFitting(this.currentShipId) at line 1601, it passes 'player_ship_1' which doesn't exist in the shipFittings Map, returning undefined. The code then tries to access fitting.hull.baseStats at line 1605, causing the TypeError. Fix: Change StationUI.js:885 from 'player_ship_1' to 'player' to match ShipFittingManager's playerShipId, OR use shipFittingManager.playerShipId to get the correct ID dynamically."
