Perfect! I've created a comprehensive bug reproduction script for the ship fitting auto-fit bug. Here's a summary:

## Bug Reproduction Script Created: `test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`

### What This Script Does:

**Bug Summary:**
- **Error:** "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')" at StationUI.js:1605
- **Root Cause:** Ship ID mismatch between `StationUI.js` (uses `'player_ship_1'`) and `ShipFittingManager.js` (uses `'player'`)
- **When It Occurs:** When double-clicking an item in the inventory to auto-fit it

### Test Scenario:

The script executes the following steps:
1. **Docks at the nearest station** - Required to access fitting UI
2. **Adds Mining Laser I to inventory** - Provides a test item to fit
3. **Verifies ship fitting exists** - Confirms the ship fitting object works with correct ID (`'player'`)
4. **Fits the item using standard command** - Shows that normal fitting works (uses correct ID)
5. **Verifies fitted items** - Confirms the item was fitted and explains the bug

### Key Features:

✅ **Demonstrates the ID mismatch** - Shows that standard commands use `'player'` (correct) while `autoFitItem` uses `'player_ship_1'` (incorrect)

✅ **ChromeManager integration** - Full automation with proper Chrome launch, console log capture, and cleanup

✅ **Evidence collection** - Saves JSON evidence file with:
- All command results
- Console logs and errors
- Bug explanation
- Timestamp data

✅ **Clear bug analysis** - The script prints a detailed explanation of why `autoFitItem` fails

### Limitation Note:

Since there's no `autoFitItem` command in the testing interface (double-click events can't be triggered via WebSocket), this script demonstrates the **ship ID mismatch** that causes the bug rather than reproducing the exact error. The verification shows that:
- Standard commands work because they use the correct ship ID
- The bug occurs because `autoFitItem` uses a different (wrong) ship ID

**DECISION: script_ready**
