## Execution Summary

The bug reproduction script was executed successfully, but encountered a **framework limitation** that prevented full test completion:

### Environment Setup
✅ HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled  
✅ Chrome processes properly managed  
✅ Working directory correct  
✅ ChromeManager initialized and console logs captured  

### Execution Results

**Script:** `test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`  
**Exit Code:** 0  
**Evidence Files Generated:** 2 files  
- `bug_evidence_1763488933606.json` (primary)
- `bug_evidence_1763488931866.json`

**Console Logs Captured:** 5 entries in `chrome_debug.log` (28,340 lines total)

### Framework Error Details

**Status:** `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

**Issue:** The test could not complete because:
1. Game spawned with no stations within docking range (10km)
2. `dock` command failed: "No stations within range (10km)"
3. Chrome disconnected before test sequence could continue
4. Could not proceed to ship fitting UI to demonstrate the bug

### Bug Analysis (from Evidence)

Despite the framework limitation, the script documentation identifies the bug:

**Bug Location:** `StationUI.js:1605` (autoFitItem function)  
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')`  
**Root Cause:** Ship ID mismatch
- `StationUI.autoFitItem` uses ship ID: `'player_ship_1'`
- `ShipFittingManager` expects ship ID: `'player'`
- Result: `getShipFitting('player_ship_1')` returns `undefined`

**Test Limitation:** The reproduction script cannot directly trigger double-click events via WebSocket commands - it was designed to demonstrate the ship ID mismatch through testing the fitting system, but requires docking at a station first.

### Validation

✅ Environment correctly configured  
✅ Script executed without crashes  
✅ Console logs captured  
✅ Evidence files generated  
❌ Full test sequence incomplete (framework limitation)  
✅ Bug root cause documented  

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction test framework encountered an environmental issue (no stations in range) that prevented completion of the test sequence. However, the bug has been clearly identified through code analysis in the reproduction script: a ship ID mismatch between `StationUI.js` (uses `'player_ship_1'`) and `ShipFittingManager.js` (uses `'player'`), causing the `ship.hull` undefined error at line 1605.
