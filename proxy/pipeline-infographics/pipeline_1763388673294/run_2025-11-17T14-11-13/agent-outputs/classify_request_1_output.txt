I'll analyze this user request and classify it according to the development work type.

```json
{
  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly labels it as 'CRITICAL BUG' and describes broken functionality - ship movement is completely non-functional despite user input. The ship should move but doesn't, which is a clear malfunction of existing functionality rather than a request for new features or code improvements.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "CRITICAL BUG: Ship movement is completely non-functional. Navigation commands (WASD keys and arrow keys) and tap-to-move inputs are not translating to actual ship movement on screen. The ship remains stationary despite user input. Investigate the input handling system, movement implementation, and rendering pipeline to identify why user commands are not resulting in ship movement. Fix the root cause and restore full ship movement functionality.",
    "keyIndicators": [
      "CRITICAL BUG",
      "completely non-functional",
      "not translating to actual ship movement",
      "remains stationary despite user input",
      "Fix the root cause",
      "restore full ship movement functionality"
    ],
    "affectedArea": "ship movement, input handling (InputManager.js, MobileInputManager.js), ship physics (ShipPhysics.js), rendering pipeline",
    "priority": "critical",
    "symptoms": [
      "WASD keys not working",
      "Arrow keys not working", 
      "Tap-to-move not working",
      "Ship remains stationary",
      "Input registered but no visual movement"
    ],
    "investigationAreas": [
      "InputManager.js - keyboard input handling",
      "MobileInputManager.js - touch input handling",

    ]
  }
}
```

**Analysis Summary:**

This is unambiguously a **BUG_FIX** request with extremely high confidence (0.99). The evidence is overwhelming:

1. **Explicit Bug Declaration**: User starts with "CRITICAL BUG"
2. **Broken Functionality**: Core game feature (ship movement) is non-functional
3. **Multiple Input Methods Affected**: Both keyboard (WASD/arrows) and touch (tap-to-move) inputs fail
4. **Clear Symptom**: Ship remains stationary despite user commands
5. **Fix-Oriented Language**: "investigate", "identify why", "fix the root cause", "restore functionality"
6. **Critical Priority**: This breaks core gameplay - players cannot move their ships

This is NOT:
- A quick change (complex debugging required across multiple systems)
- A feature request (ship movement already exists, just broken)
- A refactor (need to fix broken behavior, not improve code structure)
- A question (user wants the bug fixed, not just explained)

**DECISION: BUG_FIX**
