## Summary

### What I Learned from the Design Docs

1. **Game Type**: Warhammer 40K: Imperium Divided - A **Guild Wars 1-style MMO** with:
   - **Skill-based combat**: 8-slot skill bar + 1 elite skill (not gear-driven progression)
   - **Horizontal progression**: Level cap of 20 with prestige ranks for cosmetics
   - **Three factions**: Imperial (Faith), Tau (Unity), Ork (WAAAGH!)
   - **Secondary professions**: 7-day trial before permanent commitment

2. **Combat System** (from `combat-design.md`):
   - Real-time with 0.25s GCD
   - 300 units/sec base movement
   - 6 attributes: Strength, Ballistics, Toughness, Willpower, Initiative, Faction Resource
   - 4-second combat flag prevents stealth

3. **Technical Architecture** (from `api-specification.md`):
   - REST API at `/api/v1/*` with JWT authentication
   - WebSocket for real-time combat at `ws://localhost:3001/instances/{instanceId}`
   - Entity state updates via WebSocket messages

### Framework Choice: **Phaser.js 3**

Why Phaser.js:
- 2D top-down perspective matches Guild Wars 1 style
- Built-in physics system for movement/collision
- Scene management for UI layers
- WebSocket support for real-time multiplayer
- Active community and documentation

### What I Created

**Client Structure** (`output/client/`):

```

**Features Implemented**:
- WASD movement with sprint (SHIFT)
- Tab-targeting and click-to-target enemies
- 8-slot skill bar (keys 1-8) + elite skill (9)
- Health/Energy/Faith resource bars
- Enemy AI with idle/chase/attack states
- Damage numbers and skill visual effects
- Minimap with player/enemy positions
- Target frame for selected enemies
- Faction-colored player based on selection

**To Run**:
```bash
cd output/client
npm install
npm run dev
```
