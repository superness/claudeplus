All references check out. Now I have a complete picture. Let me verify one more thing - the extracted requirements mentioned specific "weapon_type" values but I want to confirm the full list is captured since it's faction-specific.

## Review: APPROVED

### Minor Omission Noted (Not Critical)
The extracted requirements missed two additional item_tier values:
- `T4_5` (Augmentation failure tier)
- `T4_75` (Second augmentation failure tier)

These are edge cases for the crafting/augmentation system and not needed for basic loot drops.

### Ready for Implementation
The requirements comprehensively capture the design intent for the Items/Loot system. All specific numbers, faction aesthetics, and W40K-appropriate naming are preserved. No generic placeholders detected.
