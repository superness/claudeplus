Based on my analysis of the client code, here's the feature selection:

## Next Feature: None - All Core Features Already Implemented

### Already Implemented
1. **Player character** ✅ - `Player.js` with full WASD/arrow movement, sprint with SHIFT
2. **Basic map/world** ✅ - `GameScene.createWorld()` creates a 2000x2000 tile-based environment
3. **Collision** ✅ - `setupCollisions()` adds physics colliders for walls, decorations, enemies
4. **Enemy spawning** ✅ - `spawnTestEnemies()` creates enemies at defined spawn points, `Enemy.js` with full AI
5. **Basic combat** ✅ - Tab-targeting, click-to-target, skill system with 8 slots + elite
6. **Health/death** ✅ - Full HP system, `takeDamage()`, `die()`, armor reduction calculations
7. **UI elements** ✅ - `UIScene.js` with health/energy bars, skill bar, HUD, debug overlay
8. **Skills system** ✅ - GW1-style 8-slot skill bar + elite, cooldowns, energy costs, skill execution
9. **Classes** ✅ - Faction selection in `MainMenuScene.js`, class-based abilities in config

### Why This Feature
The setup_client stage has already implemented features 1-9 from the priority list. The client includes:
- Full player movement with physics
- Tile-based world with collision
- Enemy AI with aggro/chase/attack states
- Complete combat system with targeting
- Health, energy, and faction resource systems
- Full UI with skill bar, health bars, minimap
- Skill system matching GW1 design

**The remaining features (Items/loot, Inventory, Economy, Progression) are more advanced and the current implementation is already quite comprehensive.** 

The next logical feature would be **#10: Items/loot** - making enemies drop items when killed.
