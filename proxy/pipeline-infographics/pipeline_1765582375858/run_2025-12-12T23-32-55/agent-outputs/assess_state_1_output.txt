## Current State

- **Client exists**: No - There is no game client (no index.html, no game.js, no Phaser or other game framework). Only HTML files found are in node_modules (not actual game client files).

- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation exists in `design-docs/`:
  - combat-design.md - Detailed Guild Wars 1-style combat system
  - balance-analysis.md
  - progression-design.md
  - engagement-analysis.md
  - systems-integration.md
  - emergence-analysis.md
  - balance-audit.md
  - player-experience.md - Player journey simulations
  - data-model.md
  - api-specification.md

- **Backend code**: Comprehensive TypeScript/Express backend exists in `src/`:
  - API routes (auth, character, combat, social, economy, inventory, quest, world)
  - Services (auth, character, combat, validation, economy, social, world)
  - Models (account, character, combat, skill, item, guild, economy, social, world)
  - Repositories (account, character)
  - WebSocket combat handler
  - Database migrations and seeds
  - Test suites

- **Can run**: Yes - Backend can run with `npm run dev`. However, there is no game client to interact with it.

## Recommendation

The backend server infrastructure is well-developed with authentication, character management, combat systems, and WebSocket support. However, **no game client exists**. To build a playable Warhammer 40K MMO, we need to set up a game client first using a framework like Phaser.js that can:
1. Render the game world
2. Handle player movement
3. Connect to the existing backend APIs
4. Display UI for skills, inventory, combat

The design docs provide excellent specifications for how the game should work, and the backend is ready to support a client.
