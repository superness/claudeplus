## Summary

I've completed the comprehensive balance audit for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay.

**VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING**

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch):
1. **Checkpoint Resurrection Farming** - Economy-breaking exploit allowing 4x reward multiplication
2. **Markerlight Cascade** - Tau set bonus creates +35% damage to ALL enemies, causing faction dominance
3. **WAAAGH! Self-Heal Cancel** - Removes risk from risk/reward Ork abilities

### High Priority Issues (Week 1):
- Elite skill RNG frustration (10% drop rate with no protection)
- Gear augmentation destruction (40% chance to lose hours of progress)
- Drone stacking ambiguity (potentially 24+ drones per party)

### Power Curve Assessment:
- Hours 1-20: **SMOOTH** - Progression feels rewarding
- Hours 20-50: **DEAD ZONE** at levels 23-27 (no new content for ~20 hours)
- Hours 50-200+: **HEALTHY** - Horizontal endgame working as intended

### Economy Health: **BALANCED**
- Currency flows match progression needs
- Material drops align with crafting demands
- No hyperinflation vectors identified

### Fairness: **MOSTLY FAIR**
- All 12 classes are now solo viable (Water Caste fix working)
- All factions have equal starting opportunities
- No pay-to-win elements
- **Exceptions:** Elite skill RNG and augmentation destruction create unfair punishment

### Strengths:
- GW1 philosophy preserved (skill > gear > time)
- All classes within 10% of DPS targets
- Prestige is cosmetic only (healthy design)
- Achievable level cap respects player time

The game is **conditionally ready for launch** if the three critical exploits are fixed. Without fixes, expect economy breakdown and Tau faction dominance within the first week.

DECISION: unbalanced
