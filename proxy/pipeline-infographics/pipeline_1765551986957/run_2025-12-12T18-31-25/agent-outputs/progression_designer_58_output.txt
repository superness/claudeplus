## Summary

I've created a comprehensive progression design document for the Warhammer 40K MMO inspired by Guild Wars 1. Here are the key elements:

**Leveling System:**
- Level cap of 30, achievable in 60-94 hours (GW1 philosophy of reachable cap)
- XP curve formula: 1000 + (Level × 500) + (Level² × 100)
- Multiple XP sources: combat, quests, exploration, and PvP with proper multipliers

**Skill Trees:**
- ~100 skill points available per character from leveling, quests, exploration, and achievements
- 3 skill trees per class with 4 tiers each (15 skills, 30 ranks per tree)
- Elite skills obtained from bosses (50%), reputation vendors (30%), and quest chains (20%)
- Integrates with combat fixes (Water Caste Combat Line, Shoota Boy energy economy, etc.)

**Gear Progression:**
- 5 tiers + Legendary, each with increasing stats and bonus slots
- Upgrade paths: Refinement (T2→T2.5), Infusion (add effects), Augmentation (tier upgrade)
- Set bonuses at 2/4/5 pieces with faction-specific powerful effects

**Unlock Timeline:**
- Level 5: Second profession, group content, PvP practice
- Level 10: Elite skills, Hard mode, full skill bar
- Level 15: Raids, faction wars, T4 gear
- Level 20: Veteran mode, legendary quests
- Level 30: Prestige system, Nightmare mode

**Endgame Systems:**
- 10 Prestige ranks (cosmetic only - no power creep)
- Build collection as horizontal progression
- Mastery systems for class, profession, content, lore, and faction
- Seasonal content with rotating Nightmare modifiers

**Economy Integration:**
- Skill training costs: ~16,000 Thrones per character
- Gear costs scale appropriately per tier
- Material requirements mapped to each progression phase
- Proper currency sinks prevent inflation
