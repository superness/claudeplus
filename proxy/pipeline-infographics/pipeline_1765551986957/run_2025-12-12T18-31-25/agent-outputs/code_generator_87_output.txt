All bugs have been fixed. Here's a summary of what was created and modified:

## Summary

I fixed all the critical bugs identified in the technical validation report for the Warhammer 40K MMO codebase:

### Files Modified

**`output/src/services/character.service.ts`**
- Added missing `isOwner()` method (lines 135-145) that returns `boolean` for ownership middleware
- Added `accountId` parameter to `updatePosition()` and `updateZone()` methods with ownership verification

**`output/src/api/auth.api.ts`**
- Fixed RegisterResponse field from `accountId` to `id` to match the unified Account model
- Removed unsafe type cast `(account as any).displayName`

**`output/src/api/index.ts`**
- Fixed characterService import to use `getCharacterService()` singleton accessor instead of broken direct property access

**`output/src/services/combat.service.ts`**
- Replaced deprecated `substr()` with `substring()` in ID generation methods

**`output/src/tests/character.service.test.ts`**
- Completely rewrote tests to match actual CharacterService implementation
- Added tests for `isOwner()`, position/zone updates with ownership, and singleton pattern

**`output/README.md`**
- Added documentation for all 6 new bug fixes (items 14-19)

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. **Runtime Error Prevention**: The `isOwner()` method was missing but called by middleware - would have crashed on any character ownership check
2. **Schema Consistency**: Account ID field unified across all responses
3. **Security Hardening**: Position and zone updates now require ownership verification
4. **Code Quality**: Deprecated methods replaced, tests synchronized with implementation
