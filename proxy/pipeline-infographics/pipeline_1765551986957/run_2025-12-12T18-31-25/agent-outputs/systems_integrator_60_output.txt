## Summary

I've created a comprehensive **Systems Integration Design Document** at `output/design-docs/systems-integration.md` that unifies all game systems for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay.

### Key Contents:

**System Integration Map:** Visual diagrams showing how Combat → Progression → Economy → Engagement systems interconnect, with complete data flow from combat victory through all downstream rewards.

**Core Gameplay Loops:** Defined three loop levels:
- Primary loop (30-60 min sessions): Explore → Combat → Loot → Manage → Prepare
- Leveling loop (Levels 1-30): Five phases from Tutorial to Mastery
- Endgame loop (Level 30+): Horizontal progression through Nightmare content, Faction Warfare, and Prestige

**Resolved Design Conflicts:** 
- Combat/Economy: Currency drops vs gear costs verified balanced
- Progression/Combat: Water Caste and Weirdboy solo viability fixes confirmed
- Gear Augmentation: Flagged destruction mechanic as requiring change (recommend T4.5 failure state instead)

**Unified Balance Philosophy:** Five pillars - Skill > Gear > Time, Horizontal > Vertical, Meaningful Choices, Faction Parity, Role Diversity

**Implementation Priorities:**
- Priority 1 (Launch): Core systems functional
- Priority 2 (Week 1): Elite skill drop rates, exploit verification
- Priority 3 (Month 1): Gear augmentation rework, Level 23-27 content
- Priority 4 (Q2-Q4): Content expansion, horizontal growth

**Final Assessment:** Ready for player experience simulation with all major systems integrated and exploit fixes documented.

DECISION: integration_complete: Systems integrated, simulate player experience
