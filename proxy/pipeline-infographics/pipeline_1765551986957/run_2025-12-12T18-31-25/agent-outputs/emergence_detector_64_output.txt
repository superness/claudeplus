## Summary

I've completed the emergence analysis for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay. Here are my key findings:

### Verdict: MINOR_ISSUES

**Positive Emergence (8 interactions worth keeping):**
- "Immortal Crusade" - Imperial survival composition through overlapping defensive abilities
- "WAAAGH! Battery" - Ork proximity synergy where Weirdboy + Choppa Boys create energy feedback loops
- "Mont'ka Chain" - Tau sequential burst coordination within damage caps
- "Kunnin' Bait" - Kommando + Weirdboy trap combos
- "Faith Cascade" - Battle Sister martyrdom chains
- "Greater Good Network" - Tau cross-buff synergy at ~50% coordination ceiling
- "Salvage Economy" - Market dynamics between progression tiers
- "Alt-Bootstrap" - Cross-character economic benefits

**Key Exploits Found:**
1. **CRITICAL: Checkpoint Resurrection Loop** - Players can die AFTER checkpoint triggers and still receive loot. Fix: Require participation in kill for loot eligibility.
2. **CRITICAL: Markerlight Spread Chain** - Need to explicitly block Minor Markerlights from triggering further spread.
3. **MAJOR: Perils Damage Bypass** - The 3s heal immunity doesn't prevent shield absorption or damage redirection. Fix: Make Perils damage ignore all mitigation.

**Degenerate Strategies:**
- "AFK Farm" via summon classes (needs active play incentives)
- "Safe DPS Only" Nightmare meta (melee still underrepresented despite fixes)
- "Checkpoint Crawl" brute-force approach (needs partial cooldown reset on wipe)
- "Never Augment" (already fixed with T4.5/T4.75 failure tiers)

**Edge Cases Requiring Documentation:** 7 situations need explicit rulings including summon death behavior, combat flag universality, and cross-faction party rules.

The design demonstrates sophisticated GW1-style systems integration. Remaining issues are targeted fixes rather than systemic problems.
