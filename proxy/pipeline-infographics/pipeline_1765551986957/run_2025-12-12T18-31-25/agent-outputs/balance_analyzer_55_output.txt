## Balance Analysis Summary

I've completed a comprehensive balance analysis for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided**. Here are the key findings:

### VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING

**Critical Issues Found:**

1. **Water Caste Diplomat (BROKEN)** - 45 DPS vs 180 average (-75%). Class has no viable combat skills and cannot complete solo content. Requires 3 new combat abilities.

2. **Damage Multiplier Stacking** - Tau burst coordination creates 7.5x damage multipliers through multiplicative stacking. Need to change to additive system with +200% cap.

3. **Kommando Infinite Stealth Loop** - Can reset stealth continuously for permanent "first strike" bonuses. Needs 4-second combat flag (already proposed in design doc).

4. **Imperial Shout Rotation** - 8 Imperial players can maintain permanent +45% damage buff. Needs "Recently Inspired" immunity debuff.

5. **Shoota Boy Energy Starvation** - 35 energy pool with 15-25 cost skills means only 1-2 casts before exhaustion. 22% lower DPS than melee equivalent.

**Balance Breakdown:**
- Early Game (1-10): **BALANCED** - within targets
- Mid Game (11-30): **NEEDS TUNING** - 2 underpowered builds
- End Game (30+): **NEEDS TUNING** - dominant strategies identified
- Class Parity: **BROKEN** - Water Caste is non-functional

**Key Recommendations:**
- Add combat skills to Water Caste (Tactical Analysis, Coordinated Strike, Drone Relay)
- Change damage stacking from multiplicative to additive
- Reduce Shoota Boy energy costs by 33%
- Cap summons at 2 per player
- Add Weirdboy solo scaling (+10% damage when no allies nearby)

The combat design document already acknowledges several issues and proposes solutions. With the recommended changes implemented, the system should achieve balanced gameplay across all three factions.
