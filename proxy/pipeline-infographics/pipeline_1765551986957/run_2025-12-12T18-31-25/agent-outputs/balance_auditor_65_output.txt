## Summary

I've completed the comprehensive balance audit for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay. Here are the key findings:

**VERDICT: BALANCED**

### Critical Issues Resolved
The previous stages (Systems Integration and Emergence Analysis) identified and documented fixes for all major balance issues:
- **Checkpoint resurrection farming** - 75% alive + participation requirement
- **Markerlight cascade exploit** - Capped at 3 targets, Minor Markerlight (+7.5%)
- **WAAAGH! self-heal cancel** - 3-second Perils Damage immunity
- **Tau burst coordination** - Additive damage cap at 3.0x
- **All 12 classes now solo viable** - Water Caste, Weirdboy, Shoota Boy, and Crusader all fixed

### Scores by Category
| Aspect | Grade |
|--------|-------|
| Power Curve | A- (smooth 1-200+ hours) |
| Economy Health | B+ (stable flows) |
| Balance Issues | B+ (all critical fixes documented) |
| Fairness | A (faction/class parity achieved) |
| **Overall** | **B+** |

### Before Launch
All fixes are documented but need **implementation verification**:
- Damage cap system
- Combat flag (4-second)
- Summon limits (2+1)
- Checkpoint participation tracking
- Perils Damage type

### Key Strengths
- Guild Wars 1 philosophy preserved (skill > gear > time)
- All 12 classes viable for solo AND group content
- All 3 factions achieve ~50% coordination ceiling (parity)
- No pay-to-win vectors
- Healthy economy with appropriate sinks/sources

DECISION: balanced
