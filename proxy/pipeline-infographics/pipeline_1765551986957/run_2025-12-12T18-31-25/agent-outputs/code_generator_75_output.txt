## Summary

I created a complete TypeScript backend implementation for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided**, an MMO with Guild Wars 1-style mechanics.

### Files Created (40+ files)

**Models** (`output/src/models/`): 10 files defining all game entities
- Enums, Account, Character (12 classes across 3 factions), Skill system (8+1 elite bar), Items, Combat, Social, Economy, Quest

**API Layer** (`output/src/api/`): 8 files with Express routers
- Auth, Character, Combat (with WebSocket handler), Social, Economy, Inventory, Quest, plus middleware (auth, rate limiting, error handling)

**Data Layer** (`output/src/data/`): 4 files
- PostgreSQL connection pool, Account & Character repositories with full CRUD operations

**Services** (`output/src/services/`): 3 files
- Validation service (names, emails, passwords, trades, auctions)
- Character service (creation, attributes, XP, secondary professions)

**Tests** (`output/src/tests/`): 7 files
- Test setup with factories, model tests (character, skill, item), service tests, API tests

**Configuration** (`output/config/`): 4 files + `.env.example`
- Default, development, and production configs with environment variable support

**Project Files**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js`, `README.md`, `src/index.ts`

### Key Features Implemented
- Guild Wars 1 skill bar (8 regular + 1 elite slot)
- Secondary profession trial system (7 days at 50% effectiveness)
- 12 character classes across Imperial/Tau/Ork factions
- Item tier system with augmentation progression
- WebSocket combat protocol structure
