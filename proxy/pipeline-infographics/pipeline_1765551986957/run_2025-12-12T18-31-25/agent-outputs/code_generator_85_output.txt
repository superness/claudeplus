The API index file looks comprehensive. Now I'll provide a summary of what was created:

## Summary

I've revised the Warhammer 40K MMO codebase to address all issues from the technical validation. Here's what was created/modified:

### Files Created/Modified:

**Models (`output/src/models/`):**
- `account.model.ts` - Unified account model using 'id' consistently
- `character.model.ts` - Unified character model with faction/class systems
- `combat.model.ts` - Fixed `Map<string, number>` → `Record<string, number>` for JSON serialization, added rate limit constants
- `index.ts` - Updated exports from consolidated .model.ts files

**Services (`output/src/services/`):**
- `character.service.ts` - Complete character business logic with ownership verification
- `combat.service.ts` - Added WebSocket rate limiting (`WebSocketRateLimiter` class), position validation for moves
- `index.ts` - Updated exports

**API (`output/src/api/`):**
- `middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - New file with JWT authentication middleware, role-based access control
- `character.api.ts` - Complete implementation replacing all TODO placeholders, explicit auth middleware attachment via `router.use(requireAuth)`

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Updated with 13 bug fixes documented

### Key Fixes Implemented:

1. **Model Consolidation** - Removed duplicate `account.ts`, `character.ts`, `combat.ts`; kept only `.model.ts` versions
2. **ID Field Consistency** - Standardized on `id` instead of `accountId`
3. **Map → Record** - Fixed `skillCooldowns` for JSON serialization
4. **WebSocket Rate Limiting** - 20 messages per 1-second window per account
5. **Position Validation** - Server-side validation for move commands
6. **Auth Middleware** - Explicitly attached to character router
7. **Complete API Implementation** - All character endpoints now call actual service methods
