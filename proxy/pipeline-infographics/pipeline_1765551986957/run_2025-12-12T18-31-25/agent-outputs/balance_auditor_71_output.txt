The balance audit report has been written. Here's my summary:

## Balance Audit Summary

**VERDICT: BALANCED (B+)**

The comprehensive balance audit for Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided validates that the integrated design successfully achieves the Guild Wars 1 philosophy of "Skill > Gear > Time" with fair, engaging gameplay across all milestones.

### Key Findings:

**Power Curve (A-):** Smooth progression from Hour 1 through Hour 200+. No difficulty cliffs or dead zones. The Level 22-27 content gap was resolved with 6 new milestones. Achievable level cap (~94 hours) respects player time.

**Economy Health (B+):** Intentional early-game deficit teaches economy value. Mid-game achieves balance. Late-game surplus enables choices. Healthy currency sinks prevent inflation. T4 Salvage Loop drives market activity.

**Balance Issues (B+):** All 12 classes now within target DPS ranges (145-310 sustained). Eight critical exploits were resolved (Tau burst stacking, Kommando stealth loop, Imperial shout rotation, etc.). Three fixes require code verification before launch.

**Fairness (A):** All classes viable for solo (minimum 75% average DPS) and group content. All three factions achieve coordination ceiling parity (~50%). No pay-to-win mechanics.

### Critical Issues for Launch:
1. **MUST VERIFY:** Checkpoint resurrection rules (75% alive + participation)
2. **MUST VERIFY:** Markerlight chain spread termination
3. **MUST VERIFY:** WAAAGH! self-damage ignoring mitigation

### Week 1 Patch Items:
- Tyranid Synapse cap at +20%
- Drone stacking clarification (2+1 global)
- Inspired buff tracking unification

**Launch Risk: LOW** - Core systems are balanced, major exploits are addressed, and player experience systems are excellent.

DECISION: balanced
