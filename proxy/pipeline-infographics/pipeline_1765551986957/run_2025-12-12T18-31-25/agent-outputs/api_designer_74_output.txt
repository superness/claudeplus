## Summary

I've created a comprehensive API specification at `output/design-docs/api-specification.md` that defines all system interfaces for the Warhammer 40K MMO. Here's what it includes:

**Architecture:**
- Microservices architecture with 6 core services (Auth, Character, Combat, Social, Economy, World)
- REST API for CRUD operations + WebSocket for real-time combat
- API Gateway with rate limiting, SSL termination, and routing

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based auth with access/refresh tokens (1hr/30day expiry)
- Role-based access control (player, moderator, admin, developer)
- Complete auth flow with registration, login, refresh, and logout endpoints

**Core API Endpoints (67 total):**
- **Character Service**: Full character CRUD, attributes, skills, skill bars, secondary profession trials
- **Combat Service**: Instance creation, WebSocket protocol with 15 message types for real-time gameplay
- **Social Service**: Party management, guild system, friends/blocking
- **Economy Service**: Auction house (search, list, bid, buyout), direct trading, crafting
- **World Service**: Zone information, map data, quest management

**Guild Wars 1 Support:**
- 8-skill bar + 1 elite slot enforcement
- Secondary profession trial/commit flow
- Skill tree tier unlocking
- Build preset saving with attribute snapshots

**Production Features:**
- 48 documented error codes across all services
- Rate limiting tiers per endpoint category
- API versioning strategy with deprecation timeline
- Webhook events for external integrations
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec for SDK generation
