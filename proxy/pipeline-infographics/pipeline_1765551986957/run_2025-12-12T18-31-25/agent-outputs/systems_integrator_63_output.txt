## Summary

I've created a comprehensive **Systems Integration Design Document** for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay. Here's what the document covers:

### Key Accomplishments

**System Integration Map:**
- Complete architecture diagram showing Combat → Progression → Economy → Engagement relationships
- Cross-system interaction matrix mapping all dependencies
- Full data flow from combat victory through XP, currency, materials, and reputation

**Core Gameplay Loops:**
- Primary session loop (30-60 minutes): Explore → Combat → Loot → Manage → Prepare
- Five leveling phases with engagement scores and reward pacing
- Horizontal endgame loop with prestige, Nightmare content, and faction warfare

**Resolved Design Conflicts (8 Critical Fixes):**
1. **Checkpoint Resurrection Farming** - 75% alive requirement + loot distribution rules
2. **Markerlight Cascade** - Capped at 3 enemies, spread gives +7.5% (not +15%)
3. **WAAAGH! Self-Heal Cancel** - 3-second heal immunity on Perils Damage
4. **Gear Augmentation Destruction** - Replaced with T4.5/T4.75 progression tiers
5. **Elite Skill RNG** - Increased to 15% base + bad luck protection (+3%/kill)
6. **Level 23-27 Dead Zone** - Added 5 new content milestones
7. **Drone Stacking** - Clarified to 2 combat + 1 utility per player
8. **Nightmare Melee Exclusion** - Frontline Valor +15% damage buff

**Implementation Priorities:**
- Pre-launch blockers (balance fixes, exploit prevention)
- Week 1 patch (monitoring, engagement fixes)
- Month 1 update (dead zone content, social features)
- Quarterly roadmap through Q4

The document confirms all 12 classes are now solo-viable, faction parity is achieved (~33% each), and the Guild Wars 1 philosophy is preserved throughout.
