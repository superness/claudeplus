I've completed the emergence analysis. Here's the summary:

## Emergence Analysis Summary

**Verdict: MINOR_ISSUES**

The integrated systems for Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided create healthy emergent gameplay with addressable exploits. The GW1-inspired "build-centric" philosophy is well-preserved.

### Key Findings:

**8 Positive Emergent Patterns (KEEP ALL):**
1. "Immortal Crusade" - Imperial 4-player defensive rotation
2. "WAAAGH! Battery" - Ork proximity-based power scaling
3. "Mont'ka Chain" - Tau sequential burst windows
4. "Kunnin' Bait" - Kommando + Weirdboy trap combo
5. "Faith Cascade" - Battle Sister martyrdom chains
6. "Greater Good Network" - Tau support stacking
7. "Salvage Economy Loop" - T4/T5 market dynamics
8. "Alt-Bootstrap Economy" - Cross-faction material sharing

**Critical Exploits (3):**
- **Checkpoint Resurrection Loop** - Economy exploit, needs verification that 75%+participation rule is implemented
- **Markerlight Chain** - Likely fixed (Minor Markerlight can't chain), needs verification
- **WAAAGH! Self-Damage Bypass** - Likely fixed (Perils damage ignores mitigation), needs verification

**Moderate Exploits (4):**
- Drone Swarm stacking (clarify 2+1 global limit)
- Inspired buff rotation bypass (verify single immunity tracker)
- Tyranid Synapse stacking (cap at +20%)
- Instance reset farm (likely fixed by 6/hour limit)

**Degenerate Strategies:**
- "AFK Crusader" - Low priority, Righteous Wrath passive helps
- "Solo Only Mindset" - Medium priority, expectation management
- "Never Augment" - **Already fixed** with T4.5/T4.75 failure tiers

### Recommendation:
**Proceed to audit** after verifying the 3 critical fix implementations. The design successfully balances faction identity through emergent coordination patterns while closing major exploit vectors.
