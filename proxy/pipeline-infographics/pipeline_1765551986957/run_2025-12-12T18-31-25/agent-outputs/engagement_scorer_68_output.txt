## Summary

I've completed the player engagement analysis for the Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided progression system.

**VERDICT: ENGAGING**

### Key Findings:

**Strengths:**
- The Guild Wars 1-inspired 8-skill bar constraint creates the game's defining engagement mechanic - choice creates identity
- Horizontal progression (60-94 hour level cap) respects player time and prevents burnout
- All previously critical issues have been addressed:
  - Returning player churn (60% projected) → "Returning Commander" system
  - Second profession regret → Trial period (L5-8) + free respec at L15
  - Build philosophy confusion → "The Weight of Choice" tutorial at L3
  - Level 22-27 dead zone → 6 new content milestones added

**Psychological Hooks (Well-Designed):**
1. Build Collection ("Pokemon Effect") - ~50 skills, only 8 slots
2. Mastery Plateau - skill matters more than time invested
3. Social Identity - builds become player reputation
4. Milestone Dopamine - rewards every 15-60 minutes throughout

**Remaining Minor Concerns:**
- Nightmare mode melee perception (monitor post-launch)
- Prestige 4+ value perception (acceptable for completionists)
- Faction warfare casual exclusion (minor FOMO)

**Final Score: 8.4/10 (A-)**

The progression system is ready for integration. No blocking issues remain.

DECISION: approved
