## Summary

I've created a comprehensive data model document at `output/design-docs/data-model.md` that translates the Warhammer 40K MMO game design into concrete database schemas. Here's what it includes:

**Entity-Relationship Design:**
- Complete architecture diagram showing relationships between Account, Character, Items, Skills, Quests, Combat, and Social systems
- 88 total database entities (45 core tables, 12 junction tables, 8 lookup tables, 15 enumerations)

**Core Schemas:**
- **Account/Character**: Full player identity with attributes, levels, prestige, secondary profession trial system
- **Skills**: 3-tier skill tree structure supporting 50+ skills per class, 8-slot skill bar presets, elite skill tracking with bad luck protection
- **Items**: Template-based system with T1-T5 tiers (including T4.5/T4.75 augmentation failure tiers), special effects, item sets
- **Progression**: Quest system with JSONB objectives, reputation tiers, achievement tracking
- **Combat**: Zone instances, enemy templates, loot tables, party system
- **Economy**: Auction house, transaction logging, crafting recipes

**Guild Wars 1 Philosophy Support:**
- Additive damage cap (+200% max) enforced at validation level
- 8-skill bar constraint with secondary profession effectiveness modifiers
- Level 30 cap with cosmetic-only prestige system
- Bad luck protection (15% base + 3% per fail) for elite skills

**Performance Considerations:**
- Materialized views for computed character stats
- Partitioning strategy for high-volume event tables
- Redis caching layer specifications
- Read replica topology

**Data Validation:**
- Database-level constraints (attribute caps, currency positivity, durability bounds)
- Application-level rules in YAML format (combat flag, buff immunity, damage stacking)
