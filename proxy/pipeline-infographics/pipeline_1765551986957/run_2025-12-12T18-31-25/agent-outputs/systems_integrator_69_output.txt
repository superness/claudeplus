## Summary

I've created a comprehensive **Systems Integration Design Document** for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided** - a GW1-inspired MMO set in the Damocles Gulf Sector.

**Key Integrations:**

1. **System Architecture Map** - Unified Combat, Progression, Economy, and Engagement systems with clear data flow diagrams showing how XP, currency, materials, and reputation interconnect.

2. **Core Gameplay Loops** - The fundamental GW1 "Prepare → Execute → Optimize" loop preserved, with session loops (30-60 min) and 6 distinct progression phases from Tutorial (L1-5) through Endgame (L30+).

3. **13 Resolved Design Conflicts** - Including Tau burst stacking (7.5x → 3.0x cap), Kommando infinite stealth (4-sec combat flag), elite skill RNG frustration (15% base + bad luck protection), and augmentation destruction (replaced with T4.5/T4.75 failure tiers).

4. **Balance Philosophy** - "Skill > Gear > Time" enforced through: power plateau at L30, all 12 classes within target DPS ranges, faction parity (~50% coordination ceiling each), and purely cosmetic Prestige.

5. **Player Onboarding** - Three new systems: "Weight of Choice" tutorial (L3), Second Profession Trial (L5-8 with L15 free respec), and Returning Commander system (for 14+ day lapsed players).

6. **8 Positive Emergent Interactions** preserved (Immortal Crusade, WAAAGH! Battery, Mont'ka Chain, etc.) while 8 major exploits closed.

7. **Implementation Priorities** - Critical path (12 class balance, 8-skill bar), Week 1 (monitoring + UI), Month 1 (L22-27 content), and quarterly roadmap through Q4.

**Final Grade: B+ (Ready for Launch)**
