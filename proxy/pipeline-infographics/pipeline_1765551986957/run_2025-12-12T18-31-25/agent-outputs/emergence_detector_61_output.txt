## Summary

**VERDICT: MINOR_ISSUES**

I've completed the emergence analysis and written it to `output/design-docs/emergence-analysis.md`.

### Key Findings:

**Critical Exploits Found (2):**
1. **Checkpoint Resurrection Farming** - Players can abuse checkpoints to get 4x rewards by having 3 players die before boss kill then resurrect. Fix: Require 75% party alive for checkpoint/loot.
2. **WAAAGH! Self-Heal Cancel** - Weirdboy self-damage can be instantly healed, removing risk from risk/reward skills. Fix: 3-second heal immunity on self-damage.

**High Priority Exploits (2):**
1. **Markerlight Cascade** - Tau set bonus spreads markerlights infinitely through adjacent enemies, creating +35% damage to entire encounters. Fix: Cap spread at 3 enemies.
2. **Drone Command Ambiguity** - Unclear if all summons share the 2-cap, potentially allowing 24+ drones per party. Fix: Clarify limits.

**Positive Emergence (Worth Keeping):**
- "Diplomat's Drone Army" - Water Caste pet commander playstyle
- "WAAAGH! Battery" - Ork synergy rewarding staying together
- "Immortal Crusade" - Crusader/Battle Sister holy trinity
- "Kauyon Counter-Strike" - Tau patient hunter tactics
- "Sneaky Git Council" - Multi-Kommando assassination squads

**Degenerate Strategies Identified:**
- Nightmare "Safe DPS Only" meta excludes melee
- Summon AFK Tech-Priest play
- Level 23-27 brain-dead grinding
- "Never Augment" risk aversion (already flagged for fix)

The systems produce mostly healthy emergent gameplay. Critical exploits must be fixed before launch, but overall the GW1-inspired design philosophy is preserved.

DECISION: minor_exploits
