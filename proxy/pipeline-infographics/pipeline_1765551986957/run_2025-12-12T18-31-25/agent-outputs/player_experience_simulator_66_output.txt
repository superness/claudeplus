## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive player experience simulation for the Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style gameplay.

**VERDICT: NEEDS_POLISH**

### Key Findings by Journey Type:

| Journey | Rating | Primary Issue |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Complete Beginner (0-2 hrs) | SMOOTH (7/10) | Build philosophy not taught |
| Engaged Player (2-20 hrs) | GOOD (8/10) | Second profession is permanent without trial |
| Dedicated Player (100+ hrs) | ACCEPTABLE (7/10) | Level 22-27 content must be verified |
| **Returning Player** | **PROBLEMATIC (4/10)** | **No re-onboarding system exists** |

### Critical Friction Points:

1. **Returning Player Confusion** - No "welcome back" system, estimated 60% churn rate for lapsed players
2. **Second Profession Regret** - Permanent decision at Hour 2-3 with insufficient information
3. **Build Philosophy Not Communicated** - GW1's "skill > gear" philosophy is a surprise rather than an expectation
4. **Elite Skill RNG** - Even with 15% drop rate and bad luck protection, frustration possible

### What Works Well:

- Full 8-skill bar unlock at Level 10 creates the intended "AHA!" moment
- Augmentation rework eliminates gear destruction anxiety
- Faction diversity creates meaningful playstyle differences
- Prestige system is cosmetic-only (healthy for long-term balance)
- Dead zone (Level 23-27) has designed fixes with 5 new content milestones

### Must-Fix Before Launch:

1. Add basic returning player re-onboarding (at minimum: "what's changed" summary)
2. Add second profession trial period OR one free respec at Level 15
3. Add explicit GW1 build philosophy tutorial element

The core design is fundamentally sound and the Guild Wars 1 philosophy translates well, but critical UX gaps in onboarding (especially for returning players) threaten retention.
