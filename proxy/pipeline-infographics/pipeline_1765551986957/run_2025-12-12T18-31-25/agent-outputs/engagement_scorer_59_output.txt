## Summary

I've analyzed the progression system from a player psychology perspective. Here's my assessment:

**VERDICT: ENGAGING**

### Key Strengths
- **Excellent reward pacing early**: Level-ups every 1-2 hours, skill unlocks constantly, major hooks at level 5 (second profession) and 10 (elite skills)
- **GW1 philosophy preserved**: Achievable 30 cap (60-94 hours), horizontal endgame, build diversity > gear grinding
- **Strong psychological hooks**: Build collection, prestige visibility, Nightmare leaderboards, nostalgia factor
- **Meaningful choices**: Second profession selection, skill point allocation, and elite skill selection all force genuine trade-offs

### Primary Concerns

1. **Elite Skill RNG** (HIGH): 10% drop rate can mean 20+ attempts (3-5 hours) for one skill. Needs bad luck protection or currency exchange.

2. **Gear Augmentation Destruction** (MEDIUM): 40% chance to lose hours of farming when T4->T5 fails. Loss aversion will make players avoid the system entirely.

3. **Level 23-27 Dead Zone** (MEDIUM): No new content unlocks for 5 levels (~20 hours). Risk of player dropout.

4. **Socializer Systems Underdeveloped**: Guild progression is minimal, no mentor system, limited trading. Weakest player type coverage.

### Player Type Engagement
- Achievers: 8/10 (strong)
- Competitors: 7/10 (good)
- Explorers: 7/10 (good)
- Socializers: 6/10 (needs work)

The system is ready for integration with combat and economy. The core loop is satisfying and respects player time. Priority fixes should address elite skill RNG before launch and gear destruction penalties in month 1.

DECISION: approved
