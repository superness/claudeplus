## Summary

I've created a comprehensive combat design document for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided**, a Guild Wars 1-style MMO set in the Damocles Gulf Sector.

**Core Combat System:**
- Tactical real-time combat with action queuing (2-skill queue like GW1)
- Primary/Secondary class system allowing deep build customization
- 18 playable classes across 3 factions (Imperial, Tau, Ork) with distinct mechanics

**Damage System:**
- 6 damage types (Kinetic, Energy, Explosive, Warp, Holy, Toxic)
- Armor type interactions creating tactical considerations
- Complete damage formula with attribute scaling, critical hits, and level adjustments
- TTK targets: 8-15s early game, 3-8s endgame trash, 3-8 minutes for bosses

**Classes & Abilities:**
- Each class has 8+ skills with energy costs (0-25), cast times (0.25-3s), and cooldowns
- Elite skills (1 per build) provide powerful signature abilities
- Faction-unique mechanics: Acts of Faith, Markerlight synergy, WAAAGH! momentum

**Enemy Design:**
- 6 enemy tiers from Trash to Raid bosses
- 5 enemy factions (Chaos, Tyranids, Orks, Imperial, Tau) with distinct behaviors
- Boss mechanics include phase transitions, enrage timers, and add spawns

**Loot System:**
- Smart loot weighted toward player class (60% primary, 25% secondary)
- 5 rarity tiers with appropriate drop rates per enemy tier
- Boss-specific loot tables with unique drops
- 48-72 hour trade locks on high-tier drops

**Integration:**
- Consumables consume T1-T4 resources for combat buffs
- Repair costs scale with equipment tier (10-5000 Thrones)
- XP rewards and skill progression through combat use
- Faction reputation gains tied to enemy kills

**Balance Notes:** Document acknowledges issues identified in balance analysis (Water Caste viability, Weirdboy solo, summoner dominance) with proposed solutions.
