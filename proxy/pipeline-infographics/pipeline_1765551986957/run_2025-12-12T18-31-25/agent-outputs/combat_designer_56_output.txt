## Summary

I've created a comprehensive combat design document for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided** - a Guild Wars 1-style MMO set in the Damocles Gulf sector. The document covers:

**Core Combat System:**
- Hybrid real-time combat with 8-skill hotbar and skill queuing (no auto-attack)
- Tab-targeting with ground-target AoE options
- Six primary attributes and derived stats with soft/hard caps

**12 Player Classes** across three factions:
- **Imperial:** Battle Sister, Guardsman, Tech-Priest, Crusader
- **Tau:** Fire Warrior, Pathfinder, Crisis Suit Pilot, Water Caste Diplomat
- **Ork:** Choppa Boy, Shoota Boy, Kommando, Weirdboy

**Key Systems:**
- Damage types (Physical, Energy, Hybrid) with armor interactions
- Status effects and condition immunity system preventing CC chains
- Additive damage stacking with +200% cap (preventing exploit stacking)
- Loot tiers T1-T5 plus Legendary with detailed drop tables

**Balance Fixes Implemented** (from balance analysis):
1. Water Caste now has Combat Line skills for solo viability (~130 DPS)
2. Damage multipliers use additive system (3x max)
3. Kommando stealth has 4-second combat flag
4. "Recently Inspired" immunity prevents buff rotation exploits
5. Shoota Boy energy pool increased 35→50, costs reduced 33%
6. Weirdboy gains +10% damage solo with reduced Perils chance
7. Summons capped at 2 per player

The system integrates with the resource/economy systems from previous design stages while maintaining Guild Wars 1's philosophy of skill > gear.
