## Summary of Progression Design Document

I've updated the comprehensive **Progression Design Document** for *Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided* - a Guild Wars 1-style MMO set in the Damocles Gulf Sector.

### Key Systems Designed:

**Leveling System**
- Level cap: 30 (achievable in 60-94 hours)
- XP formula: `1000 + (Level × 500) + (Level² × 100)`
- Quadratic curve with ~23,000 XP average per level
- Prestige system (10 cosmetic-only ranks) post-cap

**Skill Trees**
- ~100 total skill points available per character
- 3 skill trees per class with 15 skills/30 ranks each
- Elite skills from bosses, reputation vendors, and quest chains
- Guild Wars 1-style 8-skill bar forcing meaningful build choices

**Gear Progression**
- 5 tiers (Basic → Masterwork) + Legendary
- Refinement, Infusion, and Augmentation upgrade paths
- Set bonuses at 2/4/5 pieces
- No gear destruction (addressing player anxiety)

**Critical Player Experience Fixes Added:**
1. **Build Philosophy Tutorial** (Level 3) - "The Weight of Choice" quest teaches "skill > gear > time" philosophy explicitly
2. **Second Profession Trial System** - 50% effectiveness trial (Levels 5-8), commitment at Level 8, free respec at Level 15
3. **Returning Commander System** - "What's Changed" summary, character status reminder, optional refresh tutorial, +25% XP buff
4. **Level 22-27 Content Gap Solutions** - 6 new milestone unlocks, 10% XP reduction, preventing engagement valley

**Integration with Other Systems:**
- XP from combat scales with enemy type and difficulty
- Skill training costs integrate with economy
- Material requirements gate gear tiers naturally
- Milestone rewards create regular dopamine hits

The document addresses all critical issues identified in the player experience simulation, particularly the returning player churn (projected reduction from 60% to <30%).
