The player experience simulation report has been written. Here's my summary:

## Summary

**VERDICT: SMOOTH**

I've completed a comprehensive player experience simulation for **Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided**, a Guild Wars 1-inspired MMO. After mentally walking through the game from four distinct player perspectives, the design achieves an overall rating of **8.4/10 (A-)**.

### Key Findings:

**All Critical Friction Points Resolved:**
- The "Weight of Choice" tutorial at Level 3 explicitly teaches GW1's "Skill > Gear > Time" philosophy
- Second Profession Trial system (Levels 5-8) eliminates commitment anxiety with a free respec at Level 15
- Level 22-27 content gap filled with 6 meaningful milestones (Elite Challenges, Story Revelation, Mentor System, Nightmare Mode, Advanced Crafting, Faction Campaigns)
- Returning Commander system provides comprehensive re-onboarding for lapsed players

**Strongest Engagement Peaks:**
1. Level 3 "Weight of Choice" - Sets correct expectations early
2. Level 10 Full 8-Skill Bar - THE "aha!" moment where build philosophy crystallizes  
3. Returning Commander system - Among the best re-onboarding in the genre

**Minor Remaining Friction (QoL only):**
- Hub city information density (first visit)
- Elite skill trophy counter needs UI (Week 1 patch)
- Attribute soft/hard cap explanation could be clearer
- Nightmare melee perception (monitor post-launch)

**Player Type Coverage:**
- Achievers: 9/10 (elite hunting, achievements, mastery)
- Competitors: 8/10 (Nightmare leaderboards, PvP)
- Socializers: 7.5/10 (mentor system, guilds)
- Explorers: 7/10 (story, hidden areas, lore)

The design successfully translates Guild Wars 1's horizontal progression philosophy to the 40K universe while addressing modern player experience expectations.

DECISION: smooth
