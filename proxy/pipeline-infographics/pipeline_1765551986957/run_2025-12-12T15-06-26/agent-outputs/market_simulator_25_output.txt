- ✅ Natural progression feels rewarding
- ✅ Can afford T2 gear comfortably by hour 10
- ✅ Auction house exposure at right time
- ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE: First T3 material might feel expensive (150 from vendor vs 60-120 market) - teaches market value

### Mid-Game Player Simulation (50-100 Hours)

```
HOURS 25-50 (Levels 16-20)
├── Starting: ~8,000 Thrones (accumulated)
├── Weekly Income (20 hours play):

```

**Mid-Game Assessment:**
- ✅ Consistent wealth growth without runaway inflation
- ✅ Multiple meaningful spending options

### Endgame Player Simulation (200+ Hours)

```
HOURS 200+ (Veteran Endgame)
├── Starting Position: ~80,000 Thrones
├── Monthly Income (80 hours):
│   ├── Elite content: ~35,000 Thrones
│   ├── Market trading: ~25,000 Thrones
│   ├── Rare drops sold: ~20,000 Thrones
│   └── Total: ~80,000 Thrones

THEORETICAL MAX PLAYER (1000+ hours)
├── Wealth Cap Reached: ~250,000-400,000 Thrones
├── Weekly Income: ~35,000 Thrones
├── Weekly Sinks:
│   ├── Repairs: ~5,000 Thrones
│   ├── Waypoints (at 300k = 7x base!): ~7,000 Thrones
│   ├── AH fees (15%): ~5,000 Thrones
│   ├── Prestige pursuit: ~10,000 Thrones
│   ├── Alt funding: ~5,000 Thrones
│   └── Total: ~32,000 Thrones
├── Net Weekly: ~3,000 Thrones
└── STATUS: EFFECTIVE SOFT CAP ACHIEVED
```

**Endgame Assessment:**
- ✅ Wealth accumulation slows dramatically at high values
- ✅ Progressive systems create effective soft cap
- ✅ Prestige sinks provide meaningful goals
- ⚠️ ISSUE: Waypoint scaling at 300k+ may be too aggressive (7x base feels punitive)
- ⚠️ ISSUE: Players may hoard rather than spend if sinks feel too aggressive

## II. EXPLOITS FOUND

### Critical Exploits: NONE DETECTED ✅

### Potential Exploits (Low Severity):

```
EXPLOIT 1: Regional Arbitrage Abuse
├── Vector: Buy Tech at Forgetemple (-25%), sell at Agri-world (+25%)
├── Profit: ~50% margin on T4 materials
├── Mitigation Present: Time investment (15-20 min round trip)
├── Assessment: Working as intended - creates engaging trade gameplay
└── SEVERITY: NON-ISSUE (Feature, not bug)

EXPLOIT 2: Ork Territory Price Rolling
├── Vector: Random prices (0.6x-1.4x) could be rerolled
├── Potential: Wait for 0.6x, buy, sell at 1.0x hub
├── Mitigation Present: 2-4 hour spawn windows
├── Assessment: Time investment makes this marginal
└── SEVERITY: LOW - Monitor but acceptable

EXPLOIT 3: Alt Character Throttle Bypass
├── Vector: Multiple characters to bypass diminishing returns
├── Mitigation Present: Account-wide caps
├── Assessment: Mitigated by design
└── SEVERITY: MITIGATED

EXPLOIT 4: New Account Mail Bypass
├── Vector: 24-hour delay could be bypassed with AH
├── Mitigation Present: New accounts have AH restrictions too
├── Assessment: Properly layered restrictions
└── SEVERITY: MITIGATED

EXPLOIT 5: Faction Donation Rep Farming
├── Vector: Donate max weekly for rep, ignore other content
├── Mitigation Present: 5,000 Throne weekly cap
├── Assessment: Cap limits value extraction
└── SEVERITY: MITIGATED
```

### Theoretical Infinite Loop Analysis:

```
LOOP CHECK 1: Craft → Sell → Buy Materials → Craft
├── Crafting fee: 10% of base value
├── AH fee: 8-15% of sale
├── Total loop tax: 18-25%
├── Result: LOSES MONEY EACH CYCLE
└── STATUS: SAFE ✅

LOOP CHECK 2: Vendor Buy → AH Sell
├── NPC sell price: 5x NPC buy price
├── Player trading: 1.5x-4x vendor buy
├── Best case: Buy at 5x, sell at 4x = LOSS
└── STATUS: SAFE ✅

LOOP CHECK 3: Combat Farm → Vendor → Combat Farm
├── Diminishing returns after 2 hours
├── 3 hours = 75% rewards
├── 4+ hours = 25% rewards
├── Result: Self-limiting
└── STATUS: SAFE ✅
```

---

## III. BALANCE ISSUES

### Issues Requiring Tuning:

```
ISSUE 1: Waypoint Scaling Too Aggressive
├── Problem: At 300k Thrones, waypoints cost 7x base
├── Impact: Wealthy players may feel punished for success
├── Current Formula: Base × (1 + wallet/50,000)
├── Recommendation: Cap multiplier at 3x maximum
└── PRIORITY: MEDIUM

ISSUE 2: T2 Consumable Market Dead Zone
├── Problem: Craft cost ~60, Vendor sell 50, Market 35-45
├── Impact: Crafters lose money on T2 consumables
├── Recommendation: Either lower craft cost to ~40 or remove vendor sell
└── PRIORITY: LOW (affects narrow segment)

ISSUE 3: First Week AH Restrictions May Frustrate
├── Problem: 10 listings, 1k cap during critical learning period
├── Impact: New players may not learn market before restrictions lift
├── Recommendation: Increase to 15 listings, 2k cap
└── PRIORITY: LOW (week 2 resolves naturally)

ISSUE 4: T5 Material Has No Vendor Floor
├── Problem: "Cannot vendor" means price can theoretically crash to 0
├── Impact: Market manipulation risk on T5 materials
├── Current: T5 price expected 2,000-10,000
├── Recommendation: Add special vendor that buys T5 at 1,000 Thrones
└── PRIORITY: MEDIUM

ISSUE 5: Repair Cost Clarity
├── Problem: "3% of equipped value" is vague for players
├── Impact: Players may be surprised by repair costs
├── Recommendation: Show estimated repair cost in equipment tooltip
└── PRIORITY: LOW (UX, not balance)
```

### Balance Validation:

```
EARNING RATE vs PRICES - VALIDATION

T3 Weapon (Market: 1,500-4,000 Thrones)
├── Level 12-16 player earns: ~4,000 Thrones/10 hours
├── Time to Acquire: 4-10 hours focused saving
├── Assessment: APPROPRIATE for mid-game milestone
└── VERDICT: ✅ BALANCED

T4 Weapon (Market: 6,000-20,000 Thrones)
├── Level 18-20 player earns: ~5,500 Thrones/10 hours (net)
├── Time to Acquire: 12-40 hours focused saving
├── Assessment: APPROPRIATE for endgame entry goal
└── VERDICT: ✅ BALANCED

T5 Weapon (Market: 15,000-100,000 Thrones)
├── Endgame player earns: ~4,000 Thrones/10 hours (net)
├── Time to Acquire: 40-250 hours focused saving
├── Assessment: APPROPRIATE as long-term aspirational
└── VERDICT: ✅ BALANCED

Legendary Weapon (Market: 50,000-500,000 Thrones)
├── Time to Acquire: Months of focused play
├── Assessment: APPROPRIATE as prestige/flex item
└── VERDICT: ✅ BALANCED
```

## IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Specific Number Adjustments:

```
RECOMMENDED CHANGES

1. WAYPOINT SCALING CAP
   Current: Base × (1 + wallet/50,000) - uncapped
   Recommended: Base × min(3.0, 1 + wallet/100,000)
   Effect: Softer curve, hard cap at 3x
   
2. T5 MATERIAL VENDOR FLOOR
   Current: Cannot vendor
   Recommended: Add "Magos Collector" NPC, buys at 1,000 Thrones
   Effect: Prevents market manipulation, establishes floor

3. T2 CONSUMABLE CRAFTING
   Current: ~60 Throne craft cost
   Recommended: 35 Throne craft cost (40% reduction)
   Effect: Makes T2 consumable crafting break-even viable

4. NEW PLAYER AH LIMITS
   Current: Week 1 = 10 listings, 1k cap
   Recommended: Week 1 = 15 listings, 2k cap
   Effect: Better market learning experience

5. PRESTIGE SINK ADDITIONS (for wealth cap enforcement)
   Current: Max sink ~100k per item
   Recommended: Add "Legacy Items" tier
   ├── 500,000 Throne mount with unique effects
   ├── 1,000,000 Throne guild hall pinnacle
   └── Effect: Provides meaningful sinks for extreme wealth
```

### Additional Monitoring Recommendations:

```
METRICS TO TRACK POST-LAUNCH

1. Median player wealth by level bracket
   └── Target: Match milestone predictions ±20%

2. AH transaction volume by tier
   └── Red flag: >80% or <20% of items trading through AH

3. Currency velocity (daily Thrones moved/total supply)
   └── Target: 15-25% daily velocity

4. Wealth Gini coefficient
   └── Target: <0.6 (moderate inequality)
   └── Red flag: >0.8 (oligarchy forming)

5. Time-to-milestone tracking
   └── Alert if >50% deviation from expected hours

6. Dead zone detection
   └── Flag items with <10 trades/week
```

### Final Assessment:

The economy design demonstrates strong foundational thinking with:
- Well-calibrated progressive sinks
- Appropriate anti-exploitation measures  
- Clear milestone progression
- Effective soft caps on wealth accumulation
- Good integration with combat/progression systems

The 5 identified issues are minor tuning matters that don't compromise core economic stability. The design should be **approved with tuning recommendations noted**.
