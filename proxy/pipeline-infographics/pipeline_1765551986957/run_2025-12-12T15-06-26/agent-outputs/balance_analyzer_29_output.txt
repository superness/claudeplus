## Critical Issues Requiring Fix Before Launch

1. **Resurrection Loop** - Game-breaking infinite sustain
2. **Invincibility Chaining** - Trivializes all content
3. **Markerlight Stacking** - Mono-class exploitation
4. **Faith Generation Infinite** - Removes resource management
5. **Percentage Damage Uncapped** - Boss HP becomes meaningless

## Balance Issues Requiring Tuning

1. Crisis Suit DPS too high even with overheat
2. Ethereal has zero solo viability
3. Guardsman punished for solo play
4. Weirdboy risk exceeds reward
5. Construct builds underperform
6. 15+ skills never worth using

## Final Verdict

# **NEEDS_TUNING**

The combat system has a solid foundation with good GW1-inspired design principles. The 50% damage buff cap, diminishing returns on CC, and overheat mechanics show thoughtful design. However, several critical exploits (resurrection loops, invincibility chaining) must be fixed, and 3/9 classes have significant solo viability issues.

**Recommended Action:**
1. Implement all 6 Critical Fixes before any testing
2. Apply Balance Adjustments in first tuning pass
3. Re-analyze after fixes to verify DPS convergence
4. Consider adding 1 low-damage skill to Ethereal for solo play

The system is approximately **85% balanced** but the 15% of issues are concentrated in high-impact exploits that would be discovered within the first week of play.
