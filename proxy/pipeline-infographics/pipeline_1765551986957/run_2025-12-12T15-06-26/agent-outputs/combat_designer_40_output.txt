# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

This combat system draws from **Guild Wars 1's core design**: skill-based builds over gear checks, strategic positioning, and meaningful team composition. Combat should feel like tactical warfare in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium.

**Core Principles:**
- **Build Diversity over Gear Dependency** - Your 8-skill bar defines your role more than your equipment
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Countering** - Every strategy has a counter, no dominant meta
- **Positioning Matters** - Line of sight, cover, and terrain affect combat outcomes
- **Attrition and Resource Management** - Energy and cooldowns create tactical decisions
- **Faction Identity in Combat** - Imperium, Tau, and Orks fight fundamentally differently

```

## B. Damage Calculation Formula

```
BASE DAMAGE FORMULA

Final Damage = (Base Damage × Skill Multiplier × Attribute Bonus) 
             × (1 - Damage Reduction) 
             × Critical Multiplier 
             × Range Modifier 
             × Cover Modifier

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN

Base Damage:
├── Weapon Base: 10-500 depending on tier
├── Skill Multiplier: 0.5x - 3.0x depending on skill
└── Attribute Bonus: 1.0 + (Relevant Attribute / 100)

Damage Reduction:
├── Armor: 0-75% reduction (armor value / 100, capped)
├── Resistance: 0-50% type-specific
└── Buffs/Debuffs: Variable

Critical Multiplier:
├── Base Crit Chance: 5%
├── Crit Multiplier: 1.5x base
├── Modified by: Skills, attributes, equipment
└── Some skills cannot crit, some always crit

Range Modifier:
├── Optimal Range: 1.0x
├── Close Range (melee): 1.0x-1.2x for melee weapons
├── Long Range: 0.7x-1.0x depending on weapon
└── Extreme Range: 0.3x-0.5x

Cover Modifier:
├── No Cover: 1.0x
├── Partial Cover: 0.5x
└── Full Cover: 0.0x (blocked)
```

### Example Damage Calculations:

```
EXAMPLE 1: Bolter Shot vs Guardsman

Weapon Base: 45 (T3 Bolter)
Skill: Standard Shot (1.0x)
Ballistic Skill Attribute: 40 → 1.4x bonus
Target Armor: 15 → 15% reduction
No crit, optimal range, no cover

Final = (45 × 1.0 × 1.4) × (1 - 0.15) × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0
Final = 63 × 0.85 = 53.55 → 54 damage

EXAMPLE 2: Power Sword Strike vs Space Marine

Weapon Base: 85 (T4 Power Sword)
Skill: Mighty Blow (1.8x)
Weapon Skill Attribute: 55 → 1.55x bonus
Target Armor: 65 → 65% reduction
Critical hit (1.5x), melee range

Final = (85 × 1.8 × 1.55) × (1 - 0.65) × 1.5 × 1.0 × 1.0
Final = 237.15 × 0.35 × 1.5 = 124.5 → 125 damage
```

# XIII. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

## A. For Resource Designer

```
COMBAT → RESOURCE INTEGRATION NOTES

Consumable Balance:
├── Combat stims should be impactful but not mandatory
├── 1-2 stim uses per standard mission feels right
├── Elite content should use 3-5 stims per player
└── Don't let consumables trivialize content

Drop Rate Tuning:
├── Current rates support 70% sink target
├── T4+ drops are appropriately rare
├── Elite content justifies material investment
└── Boss drops feel rewarding but not game-breaking

Repair Cost Scaling:
├── Current costs are appropriate sinks
├── Don't make repairs punitive for new players
├── T5 repair costs should matter but not discourage use
└── Consider repair cost caps for legendary gear

## C. Known Issues for Balance Iteration

```
IDENTIFIED BALANCE CONCERNS

1. Ethereal solo viability too low
   └── Solution: Add defensive invocation, emergency abilities

2. Earth Caste PvP presence weak
   └── Solution: Add anti-player drone variants, zone denial

3. Weirdboy 'Eadbang self-damage can feel unfair
   └── Solution: Add warning indicators, controllable release

4. Battlesuit loadout locked feels restrictive
   └── Solution: Add limited mid-mission respec option

5. Psyker Perils at 5% catastrophic may frustrate
   └── Solution: Reduce to 2%, increase moderate tier

6. WAAAGH! energy decay too fast for small groups
   └── Solution: Scale decay inversely with group size

# XIV. SUMMARY

This combat system creates a **Guild Wars 1-inspired tactical experience** set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Key features:

- **8-Skill Bar** with meaningful choices
- **15 Unique Professions** across 3 factions
- **Build Diversity** over gear dependency
- **Strategic Combat** with cover, positioning, and team coordination
- **Faction Identity** expressed through unique mechanics
- **Balanced PvP and PvE** with appropriate scaling
- **Integrated Economy** through consumables and repair costs

The system requires iteration on identified issues (Ethereal/Earth Caste viability, some Ork mechanics) but provides a strong foundation for engaging, skill-based combat.
