### OVERALL ASSESSMENT: **NEEDS_TUNING**

**Positive Findings:**
- Core damage formulas are mathematically sound
- TTK targets are appropriate across all game phases
- Class diversity is excellent with meaningful choices
- Difficulty curve scales correctly
- Most exploits from combat design already addressed
- GW1-style primary/secondary system well implemented

**Issues Requiring Resolution:**
1. **3 HIGH severity exploits** need immediate fixes
2. **Water Caste Diplomat** is non-viable in current state
3. **Weirdboy solo play** is severely handicapped
4. **Ambiguous wording** on several mechanics creates exploit potential
5. **Fire Warrior melee** path exists in flavor but not mechanics

**Risk Assessment:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Summoner meta dominance | Medium | High | Fix required |
| Kommando infinite loop | High | Medium | Fix required |
| Water Caste abandonment | High | Medium | Buff required |
| Checkpoint abuse | Medium | Medium | Fix required |
| General balance | Low | Low | Acceptable |

### SUMMARY TABLE

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Early Game (1-10) | ✅ BALANCED | Challenging but fair |
| Mid Game (11-30) | ✅ BALANCED | Power curve appropriate |
| End Game (30+) | ✅ BALANCED | Power fantasy achieved |
| Class Balance | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Water Caste, Weirdboy solo weak |
| Exploits | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 3 high-severity issues |
| Difficulty Curve | ✅ BALANCED | Smooth progression |
| Build Diversity | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Some dead-end builds |

**The combat system has a strong foundation but requires the specific fixes outlined above before it can be considered production-ready.**
