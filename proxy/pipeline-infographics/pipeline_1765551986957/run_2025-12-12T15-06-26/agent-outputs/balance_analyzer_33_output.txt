## SUMMARY

The combat system demonstrates strong foundational design with Guild Wars 1-inspired build diversity and tactical depth. Core DPS calculations are mathematically sound, with mid and endgame targets properly achieved.

**Critical Issues Found:**
- Tau Markerlight stacking creates 65% damage bonus (should cap at 32%)
- Ork WAAAGH! scales exponentially with group size (needs hard cap)
- CC immunity can be gamed for near-invincibility
- Crisis Suit Nova Reactor bypasses intended risk/reward

**Additional Concerns:**
- Level 10 difficulty spike (3.5× increase) will cause player churn
- Tank archetype lacks functional aggro mechanics
- Several skills are trap options (Dig In, Bonding Knife)
- Early game TTK is ~20% too slow

All issues are addressable through number tuning rather than system redesign. The design is solid - it just needs calibration before launch.
