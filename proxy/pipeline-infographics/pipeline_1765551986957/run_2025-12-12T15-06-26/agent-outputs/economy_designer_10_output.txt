# Economy Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Following Guild Wars 1's proven model: **accessible markets, meaningful trades, minimal tedium**. The economy should enhance gameplay, not replace it. Players should engage with markets because it's rewarding, not because it's required.

**Core Principles:**
- Trading is a choice, not a necessity for progression
- Markets facilitate player interaction, not replace it
- Regional variation creates opportunity, not barriers
- Inflation prevention is built-in, not bolt-on

# IV. DYNAMIC PRICING SYSTEM

## A. Material Vendor Pricing

### Core Formula
```
DYNAMIC PRICE CALCULATION

Base Price × Demand Modifier × Supply Modifier = Current Price

Demand Modifier:
├── Low purchases (bottom 25%): 0.85x
├── Average purchases (middle 50%): 1.0x
├── High purchases (top 25%): 1.20x
├── Extreme purchases (top 5%): 1.30x
└── Cap: 0.70x minimum, 1.30x maximum (±30%)

Supply Modifier:
├── After major event/content: 0.90x (flooding prevention)
├── Standard period: 1.0x
├── Content drought: 1.10x
└── Dynamically calculated server-wide

Reset Mechanics:
├── Daily: 10% regression toward baseline
├── Weekly: 50% regression toward baseline
├── Cap reached: 72-hour freeze at cap
└── Cooldown: 5-minute between purchases per player
```

### Example Pricing
```
T2 CERAMITE SHARDS - BASELINE 25g

Scenario 1: Low Demand Week
├── Demand Modifier: 0.85x
├── Supply Modifier: 1.0x
├── Price: 25 × 0.85 = 21g (16% discount)

Scenario 2: High Demand (New Content)
├── Demand Modifier: 1.25x
├── Supply Modifier: 0.90x (flooding prevention)
├── Price: 25 × 1.25 × 0.90 = 28g (12% markup)

Scenario 3: Extreme Demand
├── Demand Modifier: 1.30x (capped)
├── Supply Modifier: 1.0x
├── Price: 25 × 1.30 = 32g (28% markup, at cap)
```

## B. Regional Price Variation

### Zone-Based Modifiers
```

```

### Arbitrage Opportunities
```
DESIGNED ARBITRAGE ROUTES

Route: Forge World → Core World
├── Buy: T2 Metals at 21g (0.85x)
├── Travel: 150g waypoint
├── Sell: T2 Metals at 25g (1.0x)
