# II. EXPLOITS FOUND

## A. Confirmed Exploits

### Exploit #1: Repair Cost Avoidance
```
REPAIR BYPASS LOOP

Mechanic:
├── Death penalty: 50% repair cost
├── Full repair T5: 300g
├── Death repair: 150g

Exploit:
├── Die intentionally at 99% durability
├── Pay 150g instead of 300g
├── Savings: 150g per full cycle

Severity: LOW
├── Time cost makes it impractical
├── Loss of progress/time
├── Social stigma in group content
└── Recommendation: No change needed
```

### Exploit #2: Cross-Region Price Arbitrage Scaling
```
BULK ARBITRAGE CALCULATION

Intended Design:
├── Small profits for engaged players
├── Travel costs prevent infinite arbitrage

Reality Check:
├── Forge World metal: 21g
├── Core World price: 25g
├── Travel cost: 150g
├── Break-even: 38 units
├── Daily limit: 50 units
├── Daily profit: (50-38) × 4g = 48g

Issue: With multiple characters (8 max account):
├── Daily profit: 48g × 8 = 384g
├── Time required: ~30 minutes
├── Gold/hour: 768g/hour
├── Standard farming: 200g/hour

Severity: MEDIUM
├── 3.8x more efficient than intended
├── Requires alt investment
├── Creates "merchant alt" meta
└── Recommendation: Per-account daily limits, not per-character
```

### Exploit #3: Reputation Donation Loop
```
DONATION REPUTATION EXPLOIT

Current System:
├── Gold donation: 1 rep per 10g
├── Weekly cap: 500 rep
├── Max donation cost: 5,000g/week

Cross-Reference with Discounts:
├── Exalted: 20% vendor discount
├── Revered to Exalted: ~6,000 rep
├── Weeks to Exalted (donations only): 12 weeks
├── Total donation cost: 60,000g

Payback Calculation:
├── Weekly vendor purchases (endgame): ~5,000g
├── 20% savings: 1,000g/week
├── ROI period: 60 weeks
├── Status: NOT EXPLOITABLE - ROI too long ✓
```

### Exploit #4: Ork Teef Hoarding
```
ORK CURRENCY ANALYSIS

Current System:
├── Weekly cap: None (intentional)
├── Decay: 0.25%/week
├── Floor: 100 Teef minimum

Simulation (Dedicated Ork Player):
├── Weekly Teef earned: ~800
├── Weekly Teef spent: ~400 (gambling, Mek)
├── Net accumulation: 400/week

After 1 Year:
├── Gross accumulation: 20,800 Teef
├── Decay loss: ~3,120 Teef (15%)
├── Net Teef: ~17,680

Issue: No weekly cap + low decay = massive stockpiles
├── Ork economy inflates relative to others
├── Cross-faction trades become imbalanced
├── "Teef whales" dominate Ork markets

Severity: MEDIUM
├── Faction-specific
├── Thematic (Orks hoard)
├── Affects cross-faction balance
└── Recommendation: Implement weekly soft cap of 1,000 Teef
```

## B. Potential Exploits (Theoretical)

### Theoretical #1: Multi-Account Gold Transfer
```
GOLD TRANSFER EXPLOIT CHECK

Restriction: 500g/day for 7 days (new accounts)
Max transferable to mule: 3,500g

Cost to RMT seller:
├── Account creation time
├── 7-day wait period
├── Risk of detection
├── Return: 3,500g

Assessment: ADEQUATELY PROTECTED
├── Low reward for effort
├── Detection systems in place
└── No change needed
```

### Theoretical #2: AH Fee Bypass
```
AH VS DIRECT TRADE COMPARISON

AH Fees: 9% total
Direct Trade Fees: 2% (above 2,000g)

High-Value Trade (10,000g item):
├── AH cost: 900g
├── Direct trade cost: 200g
├── Savings: 700g

Potential Issue:
├── Players may never use AH for expensive items
├── AH becomes low-value only
├── Discovery (price transparency) suffers

Severity: LOW-MEDIUM
├── Direct trade requires trust
├── AH provides convenience + buyer protection
├── 7% premium is reasonable for service
└── Recommendation: Monitor AH usage patterns post-launch
```

# III. BALANCE ISSUES

## A. Sink Rate Deficit

```
SINK RATE ANALYSIS BY PLAYER PHASE

Target Sink Rate: 65%

Actual Simulated Rates:
├── New Player (0-10 hrs): 55% - ACCEPTABLE
├── Mid-Game (50-100 hrs): 42% - LOW
├── Endgame (200+ hrs): 40% - CRITICALLY LOW

Gap Analysis:
├── Mid-game gap: 23 percentage points
├── Endgame gap: 25 percentage points
├── Result: ~6,000g/week excess retention (endgame)
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Repair costs don't scale with income** - T5 repairs (300g) vs Nightmare income (375g/hr)
2. **Travel becomes trivial** - 500g waypoints vs 21,600g weekly income
3. **Consumable costs plateau** - T4 consumables don't increase proportionally

## B. T5 Gear Accessibility (Revised Assessment)

```
T5 GEAR TIMELINE CHECK

Design Document Claims:
├── Casual (10 hrs/week): 12 weeks to full T5
├── Moderate (20 hrs/week): 6 weeks
├── Dedicated (30+ hrs/week): 4 weeks

Simulation Results:
├── Casual: 35,000g ÷ 3,000g/week = 11.7 weeks ✓
├── Moderate: 35,000g ÷ 6,000g/week = 5.8 weeks ✓
├── Dedicated: 35,000g ÷ 10,000g/week = 3.5 weeks ✓

Status: T5 PROGRESSION CORRECTLY TUNED ✓
```

## C. Regional Economy Imbalance

```
REGIONAL PROFIT ANALYSIS

War Zone → Core (Salvage Route):
├── Buy: 19g (0.75x)
├── Travel: 400g
├── Sell: 25g (1.0x)
├── Per unit: 6g profit
├── Break-even: 67 units
├── Daily limit: 50 units
├── Result: UNPROFITABLE (17 units short)

Issue: War Zone arbitrage is designed but non-functional
├── Appears as opportunity
├── Math doesn't work
├── Player frustration when discovered

Severity: LOW
├── Doesn't break economy
├── Creates player confusion
└── Recommendation: Reduce travel cost to 250g or increase salvage discount to 0.65x
```

## D. Consumable Economy Gap

```
CONSUMABLE TIER ANALYSIS

Required Consumables by Difficulty:
├── Hard mode: T2 consumables (75g each)
├── Elite mode: T3 consumables (150g each)
├── Nightmare: T4 consumables (300g each)

Hourly Consumable Consumption (Nightmare):
├── Stimms: 2-3/hour = 600-900g
├── Ammunition: 4-5/hour = 1,200-1,500g
├── Repair kits: 1/hour = 300g
├── Total: 2,100-2,700g/hour

Nightmare Income: 375g/hour base

CRITICAL ISSUE:
├── Consumable cost: 2,100-2,700g/hour
├── Base income: 375g/hour
├── Net: NEGATIVE 1,725-2,325g/hour

Wait - this contradicts earlier calculations...

RECALCULATING NIGHTMARE INCOME:
├── Document says 375g/hour (2.5x of 150g)
├── But total endgame gross is 21,600g/week @ 30 hrs
├── That's 720g/hour gross

Resolution: Combat drops (150g → 375g @ Nightmare) is only ONE source
├── 375g/hour combat + other sources ≈ 720g/hour
├── Still negative vs consumable requirements

SEVERITY: HIGH
├── Nightmare mode may be economically unplayable
├── Hardcore content gates behind consumable cost
├── Creates "farm lower content" meta
└── Recommendation: Consumable costs need revision OR drop rate increase
```

# IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

## A. Critical Fixes (Required Before Launch)

### Fix #1: Endgame Sink Rate
```
PROPOSED SINK ADJUSTMENTS

Current Endgame Sinks: ~8,700g/week (40%)
Target Endgame Sinks: ~14,000g/week (65%)
Gap to Close: ~5,300g/week

Adjustments:

1. Scaling Repair Costs
├── Current T5 full repair: 300g
├── Proposed: 500g + 50g per death
├── Reasoning: 67% increase, scales with content
├── Weekly impact: +400g

2. War Zone Entry Fee (Non-Refundable Portion)
├── Current: 25 tokens (refunded on completion)
├── Proposed: 25 tokens + 100g (gold non-refundable)
├── Reasoning: War content should have gold cost
├── Weekly impact: +500g (assuming 5 war zone runs)

3. T4-T5 Consumable Crafting Fees
├── Current crafting fee: ~10% of sink
├── Proposed: High-tier consumable crafting fee 50g each
├── Reasoning: Creates decision point (buy vs craft)
├── Weekly impact: +600g

4. Endgame Gold Sink Service: "Blessed Enhancements"
├── New system: Temporary buffs for gold
├── 500g for 2-hour enhancement
├── Reasoning: Optional but powerful sink
├── Weekly impact: +1,500g (3 sessions)

5. Increased Travel for Endgame Content
├── Raid staging: 200g → 400g
├── Nightmare dungeon entry: New 150g fee
├── Weekly impact: +800g

Total Additional Sinks: +3,800g/week
├── New sink rate: ~58%
├── Remaining gap: 7% (acceptable variance)
```

### Fix #2: Consumable Cost Rebalancing
```
CONSUMABLE ECONOMY FIX

Current Issue: Nightmare consumables exceed income

Option A: Reduce Consumable Costs
├── T4 consumables: 300g → 150g
├── Hourly cost: 2,100g → 1,050g
├── Net with income: -330g/hour (still negative)
├── Status: INSUFFICIENT

Option B: Increase Nightmare Rewards
├── Base income: 375g/hour → 600g/hour
├── With other sources: ~950g/hour
├── Net vs consumables: ~-1,150g/hour
├── Status: STILL INSUFFICIENT

Option C: Consumable Drop Rate Increase (RECOMMENDED)
├── Add consumable drops to Nightmare content
├── Drop rate: 1 T4 consumable per 15 minutes
├── Value recovered: 4 × 300g = 1,200g/hour
├── Net: +150-450g/hour profit
├── Status: SUSTAINABLE ✓

Recommendation: Implement Option C
├── Thematic: Harder content = better supplies found
├── Economic: Self-sustaining loop
├── Engagement: Reduces farm-lower-content behavior
```

### Fix #3: Arbitrage Per-Account Limits
```
ARBITRAGE LIMIT CHANGE

Current: 50 materials/day per character
Exploit: 8 characters × 50 = 400 materials/day

Proposed: 50 materials/day per account (shared)
├── Eliminates alt-army arbitrage
├── Preserves single-character gameplay
├── Reduces gold/hour from 768 to 96

Implementation Note:
├── Track purchases at account level
├── Display "Account Daily Limit: X/50"
└── Reset at daily server reset time
```

## B. Recommended Adjustments (High Priority)

### Adjustment #1: Ork Teef Weekly Soft Cap
```
ORK CURRENCY BALANCING

Current: No weekly cap, 0.25% decay
Issue: Infinite accumulation potential

Proposed Soft Cap System:
├── First 500 Teef/week: Full value
├── 501-750 Teef/week: 75% value
├── 751-1000 Teef/week: 50% value
├── 1001+ Teef/week: 25% value

Effect:
├── Casual Ork: No change
├── Dedicated Ork: 500 + 187 + 125 + 50 = 862 effective max
├── Maintains "wild" Ork economy theme
├── Prevents infinite stockpiling
```

### Adjustment #2: War Zone Travel Cost
```
WAR ZONE ARBITRAGE FIX

Current: 400g travel, 67 units break-even, 50 unit cap
Result: Route mathematically impossible to profit

Option A: Reduce Travel
├── 400g → 250g
├── Break-even: 42 units
├── Profit: (50-42) × 6g = 48g/day
├── Status: Marginally viable ✓

Option B: Increase Discount
├── Salvage 0.75x → 0.65x
├── Profit: 25g - 16g = 9g/unit
├── Break-even: 44 units
├── Profit: (50-44) × 9g = 54g/day
├── Status: Marginally viable ✓

Recommendation: Option A (simpler)
```

## C. Monitoring Requirements (Post-Launch)

```
CRITICAL METRICS TO TRACK

Week 1:
├── New player milestone achievement rate (target: >90%)
├── Average time to full T2 (target: 8-12 hours)
├── AH listing volume (baseline establishment)

Week 4:
├── Sink rate by player bracket
├── Gold supply growth rate (target: <5%/month)
├── T3 equipment price stability (±10%)

Month 3:
├── Endgame wealth distribution (Gini coefficient)
├── Regional price variance (should be 10-30%)
├── Cross-faction currency exchange rates

Intervention Triggers:
├── Sink rate drops below 50%: Increase service costs 10%
├── Gold supply growth >7%/month: Emergency sink event
├── T5 prices deflate >20%: Reduce drop rates
└── New player dropout >30% at 10-hour mark: Ease early costs
```

# VI. VERDICT

## Assessment: **NEEDS_TUNING**

The economy design is fundamentally sound with excellent new player pacing and achievable progression milestones. However, critical issues must be addressed:

**Blocking Issues (Must Fix):**
1. Endgame sink rate is 25 percentage points below target - will cause inflation within 3-6 months
2. Nightmare mode consumable costs exceed income by ~1,700g/hour - makes endgame content economically irrational
3. Per-character arbitrage limits enable 3.8x exploit with alt armies

**Non-Blocking Issues (Should Fix):**
4. Ork Teef unlimited accumulation will create faction economy imbalance
5. War Zone arbitrage route is mathematically unprofitable despite being designed as viable

**Validated Systems:**
- T5 gear timeline correctly tuned
- New player progression on target
- AH fee structure appropriate
- Dynamic pricing bounds reasonable
- RMT prevention adequate

The economy cannot ship without fixes #1-3. With the recommended adjustments, this design will support a healthy long-term economy.
