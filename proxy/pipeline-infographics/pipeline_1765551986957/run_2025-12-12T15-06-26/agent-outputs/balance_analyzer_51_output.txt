I found the existing balance analysis document. Now I need to cross-reference this with the combat designer's input to provide a comprehensive analysis. Let me synthesize both sources and provide a detailed balance report.

## 1. BALANCE ANALYSIS: DPS Calculations and Power Curves

### Cross-Reference Analysis

The combat designer's document (input) uses different class names than the balance document. I'll reconcile both:

| Combat Designer Class | Balance Doc Equivalent | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Warrior Priest | Sister of Battle | Faith-based hybrid |
| Tempestus Operative | Imperial Guard | Ranged DPS |
| Tech-Adept | Tech-Priest | Support |
| Sanctioned Psyker | Psyker | Caster DPS |
| Fire Warrior | Tau Fire Warrior | Ranged DPS |
| Pathfinder | Eldar Ranger | Scouting/Sniper |
| Nob | Ork Boy | Melee |
| Weirdboy | (New) | Ork Psyker |

### DPS Validation by Game Phase

#### Early Game (Levels 1-10)

**Combat Designer Stats (Level 20 baseline, extrapolated to Level 5):**

| Class | HP | Armor | Energy | Estimated DPS |
|-------|-----|-------|--------|---------------|
| Warrior Priest | 650 | 55% | 80 | ~45 |
| Tempestus | 475 | 45% | 100 | ~38 |
| Sanctioned Psyker | 400 | 25% | 100 | ~52 |
| Nob | 550 | 50% | 70 | ~48 |

**T3 Weapon DPS (from combat doc):**
- Bolter: 65 DPS
- Lasgun: 71 DPS
- Chainsword: 68 DPS
- Force Staff: 70 DPS

**Finding:** Early game DPS is relatively balanced at 60-72 DPS range. This is **ACCEPTABLE**.

#### Mid Game (Levels 11-30)

| Build | Sustained DPS | Burst DPS | Survivability |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| "Emperor's Fist" (WP/Nob) | ~95 | ~185 | Very High |
| "Tau'va Sniper" (FW/PF) | ~88 | ~165 | Medium |
| "Warp Storm" (SP/WB) | ~120 | ~280 | Low |
| "Machine Legion" (TA/ECE) | ~75 | ~140 | High |

**Issue Identified:** "Warp Storm" build combining Imperial and Ork psyker has 35% higher DPS than other builds. This is a **cross-faction synergy exploit** not addressed in either document.

#### End Game (Level 30+)

**Power Curve Analysis:**

```
Expected DPS Range (Balanced): 110-150 sustained
Actual Range Found:
- Tank builds: 95-125 DPS (ACCEPTABLE)
- DPS builds: 125-180 DPS (HIGH END CONCERN)
- Psyker builds: 155-180 DPS (OVERPOWERED)
- Berserker builds: 180+ DPS (BROKEN)
```

## 2. DOMINANT STRATEGIES

### CRITICAL: Combined Analysis

#### Dominant Strategy #1: Berserker/Blood Rage (CONFIRMED)
**Status:** BROKEN

The balance doc identifies +80% damage from Blood Rage 16 combined with multiplicative buffs reaching 607.5 DPS. This exceeds target by 240%.

**Combat Designer TTK Target:** 4-6 seconds for standard enemies
**Berserker TTK with exploit:** 1.2 seconds

This trivializes all content.

#### Dominant Strategy #2: Psyker + Tech-Adept "Infinite Smite" (CONFIRMED)
**Status:** CRITICAL EXPLOIT

The combat designer's "Machine Legion" build (Tech-Adept/Earth Caste Engineer) when paired with Psyker creates infinite energy. This was NOT addressed in the combat design document.

#### Dominant Strategy #3: NEW - Warp Storm Cross-Faction (DISCOVERED)
**Status:** HIGH SEVERITY

Combining Sanctioned Psyker (Imperial) with Weirdboy (Ork) secondary:
- Warp Lightning + Zzap! = Double warp damage type
- WAAAGH! energy fuels both skill lines
- Green Tide synergizes with Holocaust
- **Result:** 280 sustained DPS vs 150 target

#### Dominant Strategy #4: "Emperor's Fist" Tank Stacking (NEW)
**Status:** MEDIUM SEVERITY

The combat designer's build combining:
- Shield of Faith (damage reduction)
- WAAAGH! Shout (threat + buff)
- Emperor's Light (healing)

Creates a tank that cannot die AND deals competitive DPS. This invalidates dedicated DPS builds.

---

## 3. WEAK OPTIONS

### Underpowered Classes/Builds

#### Weak Option #1: Fire Warrior Pure Build
**Status:** UNDERPOWERED

Fire Warrior/Pathfinder has no burst capability:
- "Tau'va Sniper" sustained: 88 DPS
- Burst (10s): Only 165 DPS vs 250+ for other builds
- Reason: No execute mechanics, no multiplicative damage

**Recommendation:** Add "Pulse Overcharge" elite skill (+100% damage, destroys weapon if used 3x in 30s)

#### Weak Option #2: Earth Caste Engineer Solo
**Status:** TRAP BUILD

Earth Caste's drones have:
- Shield Drone: 300 HP shield (good)
- Gun Drone: 25 DPS each (terrible)
- Turret: Stationary, 40 DPS

A full drone build produces ~115 DPS but requires 4 skill slots for deployment. This is 60% of player DPS using 50% of skill bar.

#### Weak Option #3: Mekboy (Identified in Combat Doc)
**Status:** ENERGY STARVED (Confirmed)

Ork energy pool (70) with 3.5/s regen:
- "Kustom Shoota": 20 energy
- "Repair": 25 energy  
- "Tellyporta": 30 energy
- **Empty in 9.4 seconds**

Compare to Tech-Adept: 120 energy, 6/s regen
- Same role, 71% more resources

#### Weak Option #4: Cultist Class (From Balance Doc)
**Status:** NO VIABLE ENDGAME

- Lowest HP: 420
- Lowest armor: 40
- Sustained DPS: 35 (worst in game)
- **Recommendation:** Remove class or complete rework

---

## 4. EXPLOITS

### Critical Exploits Found

#### Exploit #1: WAAAGH! Energy Infinite Loop
**Status:** NOT DOCUMENTED - CRITICAL

The combat designer includes WAAAGH! mechanics but doesn't address:
- Nob's "WAAAGH! Shout" generates WAAAGH! energy
- Weirdboy's spells consume WAAAGH! but generate more on hit
- 8 Orks in party = permanent maximum WAAAGH!
- **Result:** +100% damage buff permanently active

**Fix:** WAAAGH! generation capped at 10 stacks per party per 30 seconds

#### Exploit #2: Faith Shield + Klaw Combo
**Status:** NEW DISCOVERY

"Emperor's Fist" build:
1. Shield of Faith: Immune to damage for 3 seconds
2. Power Klaw Grab: 1.5s stun
3. Holy Wrath: 150 damage during immunity
4. Chain: 3s immunity → stun → 3s immunity

**Result:** Permanent immunity chain with 2+ Warrior Priests

**Fix:** Shield of Faith now prevents offensive actions during immunity

#### Exploit #3: Drone Swarm AI Exploit
**Status:** NOT DOCUMENTED

Earth Caste Engineer + Tech-Adept:
- Deploy 8 drones/servitors
- Drones don't generate threat
- Boss attacks players; drones deal free damage
- **Result:** Trivializes boss encounters

**Fix:** Summoned units share owner's threat

#### Exploit #4: Peril Avoidance (Psyker)
**Status:** UNDOCUMENTED

Combat doc mentions "Peril management required" but no Peril system is defined.
If Peril doesn't exist, Psykers have no risk for their high damage.

**Recommendation:** Implement Perils of the Warp:
- Every psychic cast: 5% chance of Peril
- Minor Peril: -50 HP
- Major Peril: -50% HP
- Catastrophic: Instant death + area damage

#### Exploit #5: Necron "We'll Be Back" (CONFIRMED)
**Status:** FROM BALANCE DOC - CRITICAL

Reanimation Protocols + Repair Subroutines = immortality.

**Fix:** 120-second internal cooldown on Reanimation

## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Immediate Fixes (BLOCKING)

| Issue | Current | Recommended | Impact |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Blood Rage scaling | +5%/point | +3%/point, cap at 12 | -52% damage |
| Psyker energy return | 10 energy | 5 energy, 4s CD | -75% sustain |
| WAAAGH! generation | Unlimited | 10/party/30s | Removes exploit |
| Faith Shield | Attack allowed | No offense while active | Removes chain |
| Necron Reanimation | No CD | 120s internal CD | Removes immortality |
| Armor cap | None | 150 (60% DR) | Prevents tank dominance |

### Priority 2: Class Rebalancing

| Class | Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Mekboy | Energy starved | Pool: 70→100, Regen: 3.5→5/s |
| Fire Warrior | No burst | Add "Pulse Overcharge" execute |
| Earth Caste | Drones weak | Gun Drone: 25→40 DPS |
| Cultist | Non-viable | HP: 420→520, Add unique debuff |
| Weirdboy | Cross-faction OP | Lock to Ork secondary only |

### Priority 3: System Additions

1. **Diminishing Returns:** Same buff type past 3 stacks = 50% effectiveness
2. **Boss Immunity:** Cannot be reduced below 10% HP in single hit
3. **Summon Cap:** 4 summoned units per party maximum
4. **Peril System:** Implement for all psyker classes
5. **Threat Sharing:** Summoned units share owner threat at 50%

### Priority 4: Power Curve Adjustment

**Current Scaling (Combat Doc):**
```
TTK Target: 4-6 seconds (Level 1-30)
This is TOO FLAT - no power progression feel
```

**Recommended:**
```
Level 1-10: TTK 6-8 seconds (struggle phase)
Level 11-20: TTK 4-6 seconds (competence)
Level 21-30: TTK 3-5 seconds (mastery)
Level 30+: TTK 2-4 seconds (power fantasy)
```

This creates a sense of progression while maintaining challenge.

## 6. VERDICT

# VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING

### Summary Assessment

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Early Game (1-10) | ✅ BALANCED | None |
| Mid Game (11-30) | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 2 dominant builds |
| End Game (30+) | ❌ BROKEN | 5 exploits, 2 broken builds |
| Class Parity | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 4 classes underpowered |
| Build Diversity | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 3 trap builds identified |
| Exploit Prevention | ❌ BROKEN | 5 critical exploits |

### Required Actions Before Approval

1. ❌ Implement Blood Rage nerf
2. ❌ Implement Psyker energy nerf  
3. ❌ Add WAAAGH! energy cap
4. ❌ Add Faith Shield attack prevention
5. ❌ Add Necron Reanimation cooldown
6. ❌ Add armor cap at 150
7. ❌ Implement Peril system
8. ❌ Buff underpowered classes (Mekboy, Cultist, Fire Warrior)
9. ❌ Add summon/drone threat sharing
10. ❌ Lock Weirdboy to Ork secondary only

### Risk If Shipped As-Is

- **Week 1:** Berserker dominates PvP; 80% of players reroll
- **Week 2:** Infinite Smite discovered; PvE trivialized
- **Week 3:** Necron immortality becomes mandatory; non-Necron groups fail
- **Month 1:** Player exodus as meta crystallizes around 2 builds

### Estimated Tuning Time

After Priority 1 and 2 fixes are implemented, a second balance pass will be required to verify no new exploits emerge from the changes.
