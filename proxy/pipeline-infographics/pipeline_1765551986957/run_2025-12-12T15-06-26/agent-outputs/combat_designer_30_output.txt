# Combat System Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

This combat system draws heavily from **Guild Wars 1's design principles**:
- **Build diversity over gear dependency** - Your skill bar choices matter more than stat stacking
- **Limited active skills** - 8-skill bar forces meaningful choices
- **Positioning and timing** - Combat rewards tactical play, not button mashing
- **Team synergy** - Classes complement each other without hard requirements
- **No holy trinity lock** - Flexible roles, not forced Tank/Healer/DPS

**Core Design Tenets:**
- Combat should feel visceral and appropriately grimdark
- Every class can complete content solo, but groups unlock new strategies
- Skill ceiling rewards mastery without punishing casual play
- Faction identity extends to combat mechanics

# III. DAMAGE SYSTEM

## A. Damage Types

```
PHYSICAL DAMAGE TYPES

## B. Damage Calculation Formula

```
DAMAGE CALCULATION PIPELINE

Step 1: Base Damage
└── Weapon Base + (Primary Attribute × Scaling Factor)

Step 2: Skill Modifiers
└── Base × Skill Coefficient × (1 + Damage Buffs)

Step 3: Critical Check
├── Roll vs Critical Chance
├── If Critical: × Critical Damage Multiplier
└── Critical Damage = 150% + bonuses (cap: 250%)

Step 4: Armor/Resistance
├── Physical: Damage × (100 / (100 + Armor))
├── Energy: Damage - Energy Shield absorption
└── Special: Type-specific calculations

Step 5: Damage Buffs/Debuffs (Additive, Capped at +50%)
└── Final = Step 4 Result × (1 + Total Buff%)

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
Bolter shot by Battle Sister
├── Base: 45 (weapon) + 30×2 (BS 30) = 105
├── Skill: "Blessed Burst" × 1.2 = 126
├── No crit (rolled 87 vs 20% chance)
├── Armor: 126 × (100/150) = 84 (target has 50 armor)
├── Buffs: 84 × 1.15 (+15% from War Hymn) = 97
└── Final Damage: 97
```

## C. Damage Buff Cap System

```
BUFF STACKING RULES (GW1-Inspired)

Damage Increase Buffs: +50% HARD CAP
├── All sources additive within cap
├── Excess buffs provide no benefit
└── Encourages buff diversity over stacking

Damage Reduction Buffs: +50% HARD CAP
├── Same rules as increase
└── Prevents invincibility stacking

Example:
├── War Hymn: +15%
├── Blessed Ammunition: +10%
├── Fury of the Emperor: +20%
├── Zealot's Rage: +25%
├── Total Before Cap: +70%
└── Applied: +50% (cap reached)

MULTIPLICATIVE EXCEPTIONS (Outside Cap):
├── Critical Damage Multiplier
├── Type-specific bonuses (e.g., +vs Orks)
└── Debuffs on enemies (separate calculation)
```

```
ENCOUNTER DESIGN GUIDELINES

SOLO CONTENT (Scaling: 1 Player)
├── Enemy HP: Base values
├── Enemy Damage: Base values
├── Mechanics: Avoidable with player skill
├── Healing Required: Regeneration between fights sufficient
└── Death: Acceptable occasionally, not frustrating

GROUP CONTENT - 4 PLAYERS (Scaling: +100% HP, +50% Damage)
├── Enemy HP: 2x base
├── Enemy Damage: 1.5x base
├── Mechanics: Require coordination (interrupt rotations, focus fire)
├── Healing Required: Dedicated healing helpful but not mandatory

```

## C. Difficulty Spike Management

```
IDENTIFIED DIFFICULTY SPIKES (From Balance Analysis)

SPIKE 1: Level 15-16 Transition
├── Issue: Elite enemy density increases sharply
├── Solution: Add "buffer zone" at level 15 with mixed difficulty
├── Implementation: Reduce elite spawn rate in transition area by 30%

SPIKE 2: First Boss Solo
├── Issue: Players may not understand boss mechanics
├── Solution: Add "Echo" system - boss previews major attacks
├── Implementation: Visual/audio cues 2 seconds before big attacks

SPIKE 3: Group Content Entry
├── Issue: Players used to solo may struggle in groups
├── Solution: Scaling tutorial mission for first group content
├── Implementation: "Training Mission" scales difficulty based on performance

RECOMMENDED DIFFICULTY CURVE

Level  | Challenge Rating | Description
-------|------------------|-------------
1-3    | 1/10            | Tutorial, cannot fail
4-5    | 2/10            | Easy, learning moment
6-8    | 3/10            | Comfortable, some challenge
9-10   | 4/10            | Moderate, first real tests
11-13  | 5/10            | Standard, consistent challenge
14-15  | 6/10            | Engaging, requires attention
16-17  | 7/10            | Challenging, build matters

20     | Variable        | Player-chosen difficulty
Elite  | 9/10            | Very challenging
World  | 10/10           | Maximum difficulty

├── Prevents one-shot kills
├── Fights last 15-45 seconds typically
└── Allows counterplay and skill expression

HEALING NORMALIZATION
├── Healing reduced to 70% of PvE values
├── Prevents heal-stacking immortality
├── Healers still valuable but not mandatory
└── Kill-focused builds viable

CC NORMALIZATION
├── Diminishing returns apply (same as PvE)
├── CC immunity after 3 applications
├── Maximum single CC duration: 2 seconds in PvP

# XI. BALANCE TUNING TARGETS

## A. DPS Targets by Role

```
DPS TARGETS (Sustained, Level 20, T4 Gear)

Role           | Solo Target | Group Target | Notes
---------------|-------------|--------------|-------
Pure DPS       | 250-300     | 320-380      | Fire Warrior, Crisis Suit, Weirdboy
Hybrid DPS     | 200-250     | 260-320      | Battle Sister, Slugga Boy
Tank           | 150-180     | 200-240      | Guardsman
Support        | 100-150     | 130-180      | Tech-Priest, Mek Boy
Pure Support   | 50-80       | 60-100       | Ethereal (via Honor Guards)

EFFECTIVE HP TARGETS (With Mitigation)

Role           | EHP Target  | Notes
---------------|-------------|-------
Tank           | 4000-5000   | High armor, defensive skills
Hybrid         | 2500-3500   | Moderate defenses
DPS            | 1800-2500   | Low defenses, relies on killing fast
Support        | 1500-2200   | Relies on positioning and team

TIME TO KILL TARGETS (Player vs Player)

Scenario       | Target TTK  | Notes
---------------|-------------|-------
DPS vs DPS     | 8-15 sec    | Skill expression matters
DPS vs Tank    | 20-35 sec   | Tanks should survive but not forever
Tank vs Tank   | 45-90 sec   | Attrition, neither should easily kill
```

## B. Critical Balance Fixes (From Analysis)

```
CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

1. RESURRECTION LOOP PREVENTION
   Issue: Tech-Priest + Ethereal could chain resurrect indefinitely
   Fix: 5-minute per-target cooldown on all resurrection effects
   Implementation: Add hidden debuff "Recently Resurrected" (5 min)

2. INVINCIBILITY CHAINING PREVENTION
   Issue: Multiple invulnerability sources could be chained
   Fix: Global "Invulnerability Fatigue" - 60 second lockout after any invuln
   Implementation: Any invuln triggers 60 second immunity to all invulns

3. MARKERLIGHT STACKING CAP
   Issue: Multiple Fire Warriors could stack infinite Markerlights
   Fix: Hard cap of 3 Markerlight stacks per target (already in design)
   Verification: Ensure cap is enforced server-side

4. FAITH GENERATION CAP
   Issue: Battle Sister Faith could spiral infinitely with kills
   Fix: Faith generation from kills capped at +50/10 seconds
   Implementation: Diminishing returns on kill-based generation

5. PERCENTAGE DAMAGE CAP
   Issue: Some abilities reference target HP percentages uncapped
   Fix: Percentage-based damage capped at 15% max HP per hit
   Implementation: Apply cap in damage calculation pipeline

6. CRISIS SUIT OVERHEAT TUNING
   Issue: Even with overheat, Crisis Suit DPS exceeds targets
   Fix: Reduce base damage by 10%, increase heat generation by 15%
   Values: Base damage 100→90, heat generation ×1.15
```
