# Combat System Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Drawing heavily from **Guild Wars 1's combat DNA**, this system emphasizes:

- **Build Diversity over Gear Dependency**: Your 8-skill bar matters more than your stat sheet
- **Pre-Combat Decisions**: Victory is often determined before the first shot fires
- **Skill Synergy**: Individual skills are balanced; combinations create power
- **Meaningful Cooldowns**: Abilities have impact because they have cost
- **Party Composition Matters**: Solo viable, but group play creates emergent strategies

**Core Combat Identity:**
- **Real-time with active mitigation** (not tab-target auto-attack)
- **Instanced PvE missions** (like GW1 missions/dungeons)
- **Structured PvP** (like GW1 GvG/HA)
- **No holy trinity requirement** (but roles exist)

---

# II. CORE COMBAT MECHANICS

## A. Combat Flow

```
COMBAT STATES

Pre-Combat: Skill bar locked, consumables usable, positioning phase
In-Combat: Skills active, regeneration paused, death possible
Downed: Limited actions, can be revived, bleeds out over time
Dead: Requires resurrection or respawn
Out-of-Combat: Regeneration active, skill bar can be modified
```

### Action Economy
- **Global Cooldown (GCD)**: 0.75 seconds (allows responsiveness without spam)
- **Animation Locks**: Vary by skill (0.5s - 2.0s)
- **Movement**: Full movement during most skills, some root caster
- **Interrupts**: Skills can be interrupted during cast time, not during GCD

### Targeting System
```
TARGET TYPES

Direct Target: Single enemy/ally selected
Ground Target: AoE placement with mouse
Smart Target: Automatically selects nearest valid target
Self Target: Affects caster only
Cone/Line: Directional from caster
Chain: Jumps between valid targets
```

## B. Damage Types

```
DAMAGE TAXONOMY

PHYSICAL DAMAGE
├── Kinetic: Bullets, blades, impact (most common)
├── Explosive: Grenades, missiles, artillery
└── Rending: Armor-piercing, bypasses percentage of armor

ENERGY DAMAGE
├── Thermal: Flamers, melta, plasma
├── Electrical: Arc weapons, shock
└── Radiation: Atomic, sustained damage over time

WARP DAMAGE
├── Psychic: Direct mind assault
├── Corruption: Stacking debuff leading to death
└── Soul Rend: Bypasses all defenses (rare, boss only)

SPECIAL DAMAGE
├── True Damage: Ignores all mitigation
├── Percentage Damage: Based on target's max HP
└── Execute Damage: Bonus damage below HP threshold
```

### Damage Formula

```
BASE FORMULA:
Final Damage = (Base Damage × Weapon Modifier × Skill Coefficient) 
             × (1 + Damage Bonuses) 
             × (1 - Damage Reduction)
             × Critical Multiplier
             × Vulnerability/Resistance Modifier

ARMOR CALCULATION:
Damage Reduction = Armor / (Armor + 100 + (10 × Attacker Level))

Example at Level 20:
- 100 Armor = 25% reduction
- 200 Armor = 40% reduction
- 400 Armor = 57% reduction
- 600 Armor = 67% reduction

CRITICAL HITS:
- Base Crit Chance: 5%
- Base Crit Multiplier: 1.5x
- Crit bonuses are additive to base
- Max Crit Chance: 50% (hard cap)
- Max Crit Multiplier: 2.5x (hard cap)

DAMAGE BUFF STACKING:
- All damage bonuses are ADDITIVE with each other
- Hard cap: 50% total damage bonus from buffs
- Example: 20% + 15% + 25% = 50% (capped, not 60%)
```

```
PLAYER POWER BY LEVEL

Level | Base HP | Base Armor | Expected DPS | Content Tier
------|---------|------------|--------------|-------------
1-5   | 200-280 | 20-35      | 15-25        | Tutorial

├── Original issue: Veterans appear suddenly in quantity
├── Solution: Gradual Veteran introduction from level 14
├── Ensure T3 gear is accessible by level 15
└── Status: SMOOTHED

LEVEL 20-25 TRANSITION (Advanced → Endgame):
├── Original issue: Nightmare difficulty too punishing for new 20s

# VIII. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS

## A. Resource Integration

```
COMBAT → RESOURCE FLOW

Combat Activity | Resource Generated
----------------|--------------------
Enemy kill      | Currency, Materials, Consumables
Mission complete| Bonus currency, Guaranteed materials
Boss kill       | Guaranteed T4+, Named items
PvP victory     | Requisition Tokens, Faction currency
```

### Consumable Costs in Combat
| Consumable Tier | Cost (Thrones) | Craft Cost | Expected Usage |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| T1 (Stimm Pack) | 10 | 15 materials | Every combat |
| T2 (Blessed Unguent) | 50 | 40 materials | Hard+ content |
| T3 (Frenzon) | 300 | 100 materials | Veteran+ content |
| T4 (Emperor's Grace) | 1000 | 300 materials | Nightmare/Boss |

## B. Progression Integration

```
COMBAT → PROGRESSION FLOW

Combat Activity | Progression Reward
----------------|-------------------
Mission XP      | Level progression, skill point unlock
Elite kills     | Specialization points
Boss kills      | Title unlocks, achievement progress
PvP rank        | Ranked rewards, exclusive gear access
```

## C. Economy Integration

```
COMBAT → ECONOMY FLOW

Combat Output | Economic Impact
--------------|----------------
Material drops| Supply for crafting market
Equipment drops| Equipment market supply
Currency drops| Liquidity injection
Repair costs  | Currency sink (scales with gear tier)
Consumable use| Currency/material sink
```

### Repair Cost Formula
```
Repair Cost = Sum of (Item Tier Value × 0.03) for all equipped items

Item Tier Values:
├── T1: 50 Thrones
├── T2: 150 Thrones
├── T3: 500 Thrones
├── T4: 1500 Thrones
├── T5: 5000 Thrones
└── Legendary: 10000 Thrones

Example (Full T4 loadout, 10 slots):
10 × 1500 × 0.03 = 450 Thrones per full repair
```

---

# IX. BALANCE TUNING NOTES

## A. Addressed Issues from Balance Analysis

### Crisis Suit Overheat (IMPLEMENTED)
```
BEFORE: Crisis Suit was best-in-slot at everything
AFTER: Overheat mechanic creates resource management
├── Limits sustained damage output
├── Requires Coolant Flush skill (opportunity cost)
├── Creates windows of vulnerability
└── Rewards thoughtful hardpoint cycling
```

### Damage Buff Cap (IMPLEMENTED)
```
BEFORE: Unlimited buff stacking enabled exploits
AFTER: 50% hard cap on damage bonuses from buffs
├── Individual buffs still valuable
├── Stacking beyond cap provides no benefit
├── Prevents multiplicative explosion
└── Maintains build diversity
```

### Divine Intervention Nerf (IMPLEMENTED)
```
BEFORE: 45s cooldown, resurrect 3 allies
AFTER: 90s cooldown, resurrect 1 ally with 50% HP
├── Still powerful but not fight-resetting
├── Encourages avoiding deaths rather than ignoring them
├── Other resurrection options remain (Tech-Priest elite)
└── Resource cost added (30 Faith)
```

### Weirdboy Variance (DEFINED)
```
'Eadache thresholds now explicit:
├── 0-49: Normal operation
├── 50-74: +15% damage bonus
├── 75-99: +30% damage, 15% misfire chance
├── 100: Automatic 'Eadsplosion
├── 'Eadsplosion: 200 damage to self + 300 unit radius
└── Voluntary explosion elite: Double damage, self-immune
```

### Condition/CC Build Viability (ADDRESSED)
```
Improvements:
├── Condition damage scaling improved (+25% base)
├── CC duration base increased (then reduced in PvP)
├── Synergy skills added for condition builds
├── Diminishing returns protect against CC lock
└── Control builds now viable as support role
```

## B. Gretchin Farming Prevention
```
ANTI-FARMING MEASURES:
├── Gretchin respawn: 3 minute minimum
├── Same-enemy farming penalty: 50% drops after 10 kills
├── Zone-wide spawn cap: Max 20 Gretchin per zone instance
└── T1 Organic material daily cap from Gretchin: 50 units
```

## C. Boss Loot Timing
```
BOSS LOOT CLARIFICATION:
├── Loot generates on boss death
├── Loot distributed at mission completion
├── Leaving before mission end: Loot mailed (minus 10%)
├── Exploit prevention: Cannot re-enter completed boss instance
└── Loot table determined at kill, not at distribution
```
