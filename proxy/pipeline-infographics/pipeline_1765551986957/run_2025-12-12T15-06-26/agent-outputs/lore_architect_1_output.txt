# Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided
## A Guild Wars 1-Style MMO - Foundational Lore Document

# I. SETTING OVERVIEW

## The Damocles Gulf Sector - 999.M41

The game is set in the **Damocles Gulf Sector**, a contested region of space on the Eastern Fringe where multiple factions clash in a brutal three-way war. This setting allows for:
- Manageable scope (one sector, not the entire galaxy)
- Multiple playable factions with clear territorial boundaries
- A central conflict that can escalate without breaking canon
- Isolation from major 40K events (allowing creative freedom)

The sector contains **47 habitable worlds**, dozens of space stations, and three sub-sectors that serve as faction home territories.

# IV. NEUTRAL/ENEMY FACTIONS (PvE Content)

## The Forces of Chaos - The Pallid Hand

A Death Guard warband has established a foothold in the sector, spreading plague and corruption. They serve as the primary "greater evil" that occasionally forces temporary faction truces.

**Key Figures:**
- **Festus the Undying** - Plague Marine Lord seeking to corrupt the sector
- **The Blighted Council** - Seven Plague Champions, each controlling a corrupted world

## The Tyranid Tendril - Splinter Fleet Apophis

An advance tendril of Hive Fleet Leviathan has entered the sector, consuming everything in its path. Tyranid invasions serve as world events that all factions must respond to.

## The Necron Dynasty - The Hollow Court

Beneath several worlds, Necron tomb complexes stir. The Hollow Court dynasty awakens, seeking to reclaim their ancient domain regardless of who currently occupies it.

## The Drukhari - Kabal of the Severed Nerve

Dark Eldar raiders strike from Webway portals throughout the sector, kidnapping victims for the arenas of Commorragh. They serve as high-level PvE content and event antagonists.

## The Genestealer Cults - The Children of the Void

Hidden among Imperial populations, Genestealer Cults prepare the way for the Tyranid invasion. They serve as infiltration/investigation storylines.

---

# V. MYTHOLOGICAL AND RELIGIOUS FRAMEWORKS

## Imperial Faith - The Cult of the Burning Saint

The sector's dominant religion centers on **Saint Avalos the Burning**, a legendary figure who supposedly held back a Chaos incursion through faith alone, her body consumed by holy fire but never dying until the last daemon was banished.

**Key Tenets:**
- Suffering purifies the soul
- The Emperor protects those who sacrifice
- Fire cleanses all corruption
- Martyrdom is the highest honor

**Holy Sites:**
- The Cathedral of the Burning Saint (Avalos Prime)
- The Martyr's Walk (pilgrimage route across seven worlds)
- The Eternal Pyre (orbital shrine where Saint Avalos ascended)

**Gameplay Impact:** Imperial characters can gain "Faith" resource through devotional acts, sacrifice, and pilgrimage. High faith provides temporary buffs and unlocks Ecclesiarchy missions.

## The Greater Good - Tau'va Philosophy

The Tau believe in a secular philosophy of collective purpose, but it functions as a religion in practice.

**Core Concepts:**
- Tau'va (The Greater Good) - The supreme ideal
- Mont'au (The Terror) - The pre-Ethereal age of war and chaos
- The Elemental Castes - Divinely ordained social roles

**Gameplay Impact:** Tau characters build "Harmony" through teamwork, completing objectives that benefit the collective, and bringing new species into the fold.

## Gork and Mork - Ork Theology

Orks worship the twin gods Gork (brutally cunning) and Mork (cunningly brutal).

**Key Beliefs:**
- Da bigga da fight, da happier da gods
- Green is the best color because Orks are green
- Might makes right
- Death in battle is the only honorable end

**Gameplay Impact:** Ork characters generate "WAAAGH!" energy through combat, destruction, and displays of dominance. WAAAGH! energy powers abilities and can trigger zone-wide buffs.

---

# VI. CORE CONFLICTS AND TENSIONS

## The Macro Conflict: Three-Way War

The central conflict is territorial control of the Damocles Gulf Sector:

```
        IMPERIUM
       (Coreward)
           |
    [Contested Zone]
         / \
        /   \
    TAU      ORKS
(Rimward) (Spinward)
```

**The Imperial Perspective:** The sector is humanity's birthright. The Tau are insidious manipulators; the Orks are mindless beasts. Both must be exterminated.

**The Tau Perspective:** The Imperium is a decaying corpse-state that wastes lives pointlessly. The Orks are a pest that must be controlled. Expansion is necessary for survival.

**The Ork Perspective:** "'UMIES AND BLUE GITS MAKE FOR GOOD FIGHTIN'! DIS SECTOR'S GONNA BELONG TO GUTRIPPA!"

## Micro Conflicts (Story Hooks)

### 1. The Avalos Succession
Governor Militant Theron declared independence from the Imperium after the Administratum demanded 90% of the sector's tithes for the Indomitus Crusade. The Inquisition has declared him Excommunicate Traitoris, but he still commands the loyalty of most sector forces.

**Player Impact:** Imperial players must choose between legitimate Imperial authority and pragmatic local independence.

### 2. The Farsight Question
Elements within the Tau expeditionary force sympathize with Commander Farsight's rejection of Ethereal control. The Ethereals are aware of this and are conducting quiet purges.

**Player Impact:** Tau players encounter propaganda vs. reality, questioning whether the Greater Good is truly good.

### 3. The Succession of Gutrippa
Warboss Gutrippa is ancient by Ork standards. His lieutenants circle like sharks, and any sign of weakness could trigger civil war—or someone might "help" him look weak.

**Player Impact:** Ork players navigate clan politics while trying to get the best loot.

### 4. The Sleeping Gods
Across the sector, Necron tomb worlds are awakening. What initially seemed like isolated incidents is revealing a coordinated dynasty seeking to reclaim their empire.

**Player Impact:** All factions must respond to Necron incursions, sometimes forcing temporary truces.

### 5. The Plague Ships
Death Guard vessels have been sighted in the warp. Chaos cults are being uncovered in Imperial cities. Something terrible is coming.

**Player Impact:** Cross-faction storylines where the threat of Chaos creates strange alliances.

### Expansion 2: The Silent King's Gambit
The Necron Hollow Court reveals its true scale. New Necron faction (possible playable race), tomb world raids, ancient technology.

# XI. CANON COMPLIANCE NOTES

This lore framework:
- Sets the game in an obscure sector to avoid contradicting major events
- Uses established factions without introducing new lore-breaking elements
- Allows for faction asymmetry while maintaining balance
- Respects the grimdark tone while allowing player agency
- Provides hooks for Games Workshop's evolving narrative

---

# XII. SUMMARY

**Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided** presents a three-faction conflict in a contained but rich sector of space. The Guild Wars 1-inspired design emphasizes:

- Deep faction identity through sub-faction choice
- Interconnected lore that explains faction motivations
- Multiple layers of conflict (macro war, micro politics, personal stories)
- Religious/philosophical frameworks that impact gameplay
- Clear hooks for all game systems to build upon
- Expandable framework for years of content

The sector is a powder keg. The Emperor's light grows dim. The Greater Good demands expansion. And the WAAAGH! never ends.

*In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war—and you are in the middle of it.*
