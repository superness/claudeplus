# 7. VERDICT

## Summary Table

| Category | Status | Issues Found | Severity |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| DPS Balance | ❌ NEEDS TUNING | Crisis Suit 50-100% above curve | HIGH |
| Dominant Strategies | ❌ NEEDS TUNING | 5 major exploits identified | HIGH |
| Weak Options | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 7 underpowered abilities/builds | MEDIUM |
| Exploits | ❌ BROKEN | 10 potential exploits, 3 critical | HIGH |
| Difficulty Curve | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 3 difficulty spikes | MEDIUM |
| Enemy Scaling | ✅ BALANCED | Minor variance at endgame | LOW |
| Build Viability | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Condition/CC builds non-viable | MEDIUM |
| PvP Balance | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Not fully testable (some skills undefined) | MEDIUM |

## Overall Assessment

**The combat system has a strong foundation inspired by Guild Wars 1 but requires significant tuning before deployment.**

### Strengths:
- ✅ Skill bar system is well-designed
- ✅ 8-skill limit creates meaningful pre-combat decisions
- ✅ Enemy taxonomy is clear and varied
- ✅ Damage formula is mathematically sound
- ✅ Faction identity is distinct

### Critical Issues:
- ❌ Crisis Suit is best-in-slot at everything
- ❌ Damage buff stacking has no cap
- ❌ Divine Intervention removes failure state
- ❌ Weirdboy variance creates unfun gameplay
- ❌ Multiple undefined mechanics enable exploits

### Required Actions Before Launch:
1. Implement Crisis Suit overheat mechanic
2. Cap damage buff stacking at 50%
3. Nerf Divine Intervention cooldown and targets
4. Define Psyker Perils thresholds explicitly
5. Close 10 identified exploit vectors
6. Smooth difficulty curve at levels 16-18 and 20-25

# FINAL VERDICT: **NEEDS_TUNING**

The combat design is ~70% balanced with excellent fundamentals. However, the Crisis Suit power level, damage buff stacking, and multiple exploit vectors would create a broken meta within weeks of launch. Recommend returning to combat designer with specific numeric adjustments.

## Resource Conflict Check
- ✅ Consumable costs appear reasonable for expected combat frequency
- ✅ Material drop rates align with crafting demand
- ⚠️ Boss loot timing (kill vs. mission complete) needs clarification to prevent exploits

## Economy Conflict Check
- ✅ Repair costs are appropriate currency sink
- ✅ Elite/Boss content provides economic incentive
- ⚠️ Gretchin farming could inflate T1 Organic supply - needs respawn limits
