Weekly Income (15 hrs/week casual):
├── Enemy Drops: 2250 gold (150/hr × 15)
├── Quest Rewards: 1500 gold (100/hr × 15)
├── Vendoring: 1500 gold (100/hr × 15)
├── Daily/Weekly Bonuses: 1125 gold
├── PvP Rewards: 750 gold
├── Total Weekly: ~7125 gold

Weekly Expenses:

├── Progression Target: T3 → T4 transition
├── T4 Set Cost: 20,000 gold
├── Time to Full T4: ~5 weeks
├── Status: ✓ ACHIEVABLE but requires dedication

SIMULATION FINDING: Mid-game feels SLIGHTLY SLOW
├── 5 weeks for T4 set is reasonable
├── BUT: Combined with T3 grind, total time to T4 is 7-8 weeks
├── Risk: Player may feel stuck at T3 plateau
└── Mitigation: Crafting and trading can accelerate
```

## C. Endgame Player Simulation (200+ Hours)

```
ENDGAME ECONOMIC SNAPSHOT (Level 50, Full T4/T5)

Weekly Income (20+ hrs/week):
├── Enemy Drops: 3000 gold

├── Consumables: ~1200 gold (T3-T4)
├── Services: ~800 gold
├── Total Weekly: ~5500 gold

Net Weekly Accumulation: ~8500-16500 gold

├── Full T5 Set: ~42 weeks (!!!)
├── Legendary Item: 50-200k = 6-24 weeks
└── Status: ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUE

SIMULATION FINDING: T5 GEARING IS TOO SLOW
├── 42 weeks (10 months) for full T5 is excessive
├── Player will complete all content before affording gear
├── Creates "wealth with nothing to spend on" scenario
└── Needs rebalancing
```

---

# II. EXPLOITS FOUND

## A. Critical Exploit: Auction House Fee Arbitrage

```
EXPLOIT: AH FEE BYPASS VIA DIRECT TRADE

Mechanism:
├── Auction House charges 10% (8% sink + 2% faction)
├── Direct trade charges 0%
├── Players can undercut AH prices by 5% via direct trade
├── Seller saves 5%, buyer saves 5%
└── Result: AH becomes abandoned

Economic Impact:
├── 8% gold sink bypassed
├── Inflation accelerates
├── AH listings stagnate
├── Price discovery breaks down
└── Severity: MODERATE

FIX RECOMMENDATION:
├── Add 3% direct trade fee for trades >1000g
├── Or: Provide AH convenience benefits (insurance, history)
├── Or: Make AH listing fee lower, keep sales tax
└── Chosen: Option 3 - Reduce listing fee to 1%, keep 8% sales tax
```

## B. Potential Exploit: Material Vendor Manipulation

```
EXPLOIT: DYNAMIC PRICE MANIPULATION

Mechanism:
├── Material vendor has dynamic pricing
├── Low purchases = 0.9x price
├── High purchases = 1.4x price
├── Coordinated groups could:
│   ├── Artificially inflate prices
│   ├── Buy at low, wait for reset, sell at high
│   └── Create artificial scarcity

Economic Impact:
├── Destabilizes material markets
├── Punishes legitimate players
├── Creates wealth transfer to manipulators
└── Severity: MODERATE

EXISTING MITIGATION: 
├── Purchase limits (50/day) reduce impact
├── 72-hour trend-to-baseline prevents long manipulation
└── Status: MOSTLY ADDRESSED

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION:
├── Add cooldown between purchases (5 min)
├── Cap price variance to ±30% from baseline
└── Monitor for coordinated buying patterns
```

## C. Potential Exploit: New Account Trade Limitation Bypass

```
EXPLOIT: MULE ACCOUNT GOLD TRANSFER

Mechanism:
├── New accounts limited to 500g/day for 7 days
├── But can trade items freely (just gold capped)
├── Player creates mules, transfers items not gold
├── Items sold on mule's market access
└── Circumvents gold transfer limits

Economic Impact:
├── RMT enablement
├── Gold laundering
├── Multi-account advantages
└── Severity: LOW-MODERATE

FIX RECOMMENDATION:
├── Apply 500g value cap to ALL trades (items valued at vendor price)
├── New accounts: 500g value total per day, not just currency
├── First week: Cannot list on AH at all
└── Implementation: Use vendor buy price as item valuation
```

## D. Potential Infinite Loop: Reputation Discount Stacking

```
EXPLOIT: REPUTATION DISCOUNT EXPLOIT

Mechanism (as designed):
├── Reputation vendors give 5% discount per tier above requirement
├── Exalted = 25% discount on Friendly items
├── Combined with faction tithe return (2%)
├── If faction donation grants reputation...

Potential Loop:
├── Buy items at discount
├── Donate items for reputation
├── Gain more discount
├── Repeat
└── Status: NEED VERIFICATION

VERIFICATION:
├── Document states donations grant reputation
├── But doesn't specify donation values
├── If 1000g donation = 1000 rep, and item costs 750g after discount...
└── Could be exploitable

FIX RECOMMENDATION:
├── Donations should grant gold value × 0.1 in reputation
├── Not item value or purchase price
├── Prevents circular discount exploitation
└── Status: DESIGN CLARIFICATION NEEDED
```

---

# III. BALANCE ISSUES

## A. T5 Gear Pricing (TOO HIGH)

```
ISSUE: T5 GEAR UNATTAINABLE

Current Design:
├── T5 Set Cost: 60,000 gold
├── Weekly Net Income (endgame): ~8,500-16,500
├── Time to Full T5: 42 weeks
└── Problem: Players finish content in ~20 weeks

Impact:
├── Endgame players have gold with nothing meaningful to buy
├── T5 becomes irrelevant before obtainable
├── Gear progression stops at T4
└── Economy loses endgame purpose

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Reduce T5 set cost from 60,000 to 35,000
├── Individual pieces: 5,000-8,000 instead of 10,000-12,000
├── Time to full T5: ~20 weeks (matches content timeline)
└── Alternative: Increase endgame gold generation to 1500/hr
```

## B. Consumable Pricing (SLIGHTLY LOW)

```
ISSUE: CONSUMABLES TOO CHEAP

Current Design:
├── T3 Consumables: 200-400 gold from vendor
├── Crafted T4: Player-made only
├── Weekly consumable spend: 600-1200 gold
├── As % of income: 8-17%
└── Problem: Not a meaningful sink

Impact:
├── Players rarely feel resource pressure
├── Consumable market undervalued
├── Crafters have weak T4 consumable market
└── Gold sink underperforming

RECOMMENDATION:
├── T3 Consumable vendor price: 350-600 (from 200-400)
├── This pushes players toward T4 crafted
├── Increases consumable sink by ~50%
├── Weekly consumable spend target: 900-1800 gold (15-20% of income)
```

## C. Waypoint Costs (INCONSISTENT)

```
ISSUE: TRAVEL COST VARIANCE TOO EXTREME

Current Design:
├── Core World: "Low waypoint costs" (undefined)
├── Forge World: "Moderate" (undefined)
├── Frontier: "Very high" (undefined)
├── War Zone: "High" (undefined)
└── Problem: No concrete numbers

Impact:
├── Cannot verify arbitrage profitability
├── May block new players from exploration
├── May trivialize regional economy
└── Unpredictable player behavior

RECOMMENDATION: Define Explicit Costs
├── Core World: 25-50 gold
├── Standard Region: 75-150 gold  
├── Forge World: 100-200 gold
├── War Zone: 200-400 gold
├── Frontier: 300-500 gold
└── Cross-region multiplier: 1.5x
```

## D. Ork Teef Decay (TOO PUNISHING)

```
ISSUE: ORK CURRENCY DECAY EXCESSIVE

Current Design:
├── Teef loses 1% value per week
├── Over 1 year: ~52% currency loss
├── Ork players penalized for saving
└── Problem: Discourages Ork faction choice

Impact:
├── Ork economy forced into constant spending
├── Cannot save for large purchases
├── 10,000 teef goal requires earning ~20,000 over time
└── Faction disadvantage

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Reduce decay to 0.25% per week
├── Or: Cap decay at 90% of current value (floor)
├── Or: Decay only applies to liquid teef, not invested
└── Preferred: 0.25% decay with 100 teef minimum floor
```

## E. Sink Ratio (NEEDS MONITORING)

```
ISSUE: 70% SINK TARGET MAY BE AGGRESSIVE

Current Design:
├── Target: 70% of generated gold removed
├── Only 30% retained for progression
├── Weekly gen (dedicated): 15,000
├── Weekly retention: 4,500
└── Question: Is this sustainable?

Analysis:
├── T4 set (20,000g) ÷ 4,500 = 4.4 weeks ✓
├── T5 set (60,000g) ÷ 4,500 = 13.3 weeks ✓ (if T5 cost reduced)
├── Legendary (100k) ÷ 4,500 = 22 weeks... ⚠️

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Reduce sink target to 65% for first 6 months
├── Monitor inflation metrics
├── Adjust dynamically based on wealth distribution
├── Current 70% is fine IF T5 costs reduced
```

# V. CROSS-SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS

```
COMBAT → ECONOMY FLOW VERIFICATION

Current Flow:
├── Enemy kill → gold + materials + gear drops
├── Drops → vendor or player market
├── Gold → progression purchases
├── Progression → harder content
├── Harder content → better rewards
└── Status: ✓ LOOP IS SOUND

Potential Issues:
├── Hard mode (2x gold) may outpace normal mode gear costs
├── Nightmare mode (3x gold) may trivialize economy
├── Risk: Players skip difficulty tiers
└── Mitigation: Gear requirements gate difficulty access

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Add minimum gear score for Hard/Elite/Nightmare
├── Hard: T3 average required
├── Elite: T4 average required  
├── Nightmare: T5 average required
└── Prevents economy skip via difficulty jumping
```

```
CRAFTING → ECONOMY INTEGRATION

Current Flow:
├── Materials gathered → crafting → gear
├── Crafting cost: materials + fee
├── Craft result: variable quality
├── High rolls → premium prices
├── Low rolls → vendor or salvage
└── Status: ✓ LOOP IS SOUND

Profitability Check:
├── T3 Weapon craft cost: 385 gold
├── Average sale: 500 gold
├── Net profit: 65 gold (17%)
├── Status: ✓ VIABLE BUT TIGHT

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Crafting margins are intentionally tight
├── Rewards skill (knowing what to craft)
├── High-roll crafting is the profit driver
└── No changes needed
```

# VI. VERDICT

## Overall Assessment

```
CATEGORY           | STATUS          | NOTES
-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------
New Player (1-10h) | ✓ APPROVED      | Well-paced, achievable
Mid-Game (50-100h) | ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES | Slightly slow T3→T4
Endgame (200h+)    | ❌ NEEDS TUNING | T5 costs too high
Exploit Prevention | ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES | Direct trade bypass
Balance Overall    | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Several number adjustments
Inflation Control  | ✓ APPROVED      | Systems are sound
Regional Economy   | ⚠️ INCOMPLETE   | Waypoints undefined
Faction Balance    | ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES | Ork decay too harsh
```

## Final Determination

The economy design is **fundamentally sound** with Guild Wars 1-inspired principles properly applied. The core loops work, new player experience is excellent, and inflation control mechanisms are appropriate. However, several specific numbers need adjustment before the economy can be approved:

**Blocking Issues:**
1. T5 gear costs create 42-week grind (unacceptable)
2. Direct trade bypass undermines AH gold sink
3. Waypoint costs undefined (cannot verify arbitrage)

**Non-Blocking Issues:**
4. Consumable prices slightly low
5. Ork Teef decay too punishing
6. New account item limit gap

With the recommended adjustments applied, this economy would be ready for implementation and testing.

---

**VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING**

The economy requires specific numerical adjustments (particularly T5 costs, direct trade fees, and waypoint definitions) before approval. Core systems are sound; only tuning is needed, not redesign.
