# Economy System Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's player-driven economy while addressing the simulator's identified issues, this economy prioritizes:

- **Player Trading as Primary Market** - NPC vendors provide floor/ceiling, players set real prices
- **Faction Economic Identity** - Each faction trades differently
- **Inflation Prevention Built-In** - Robust sink systems from day one
- **Meaningful Wealth** - Gold should always have purpose

*T3 vendor buy reduced from 200g to 100g (arbitrage fix)

# X. INFLATION PREVENTION

## A. Built-In Controls

```
INFLATION PREVENTION MECHANISMS

1. Diminishing Returns on Income
├── Caps daily gold generation
├── Reduces gap between moderate/hardcore
└── Prevents no-life accumulation

2. Multi-Layer Sink System
├── Operational sinks (repairs, travel, fees): 40-50% of income
├── Consumable sinks (consumables, crafting): 20-25% of income
├── Optional sinks (prestige, donations): Variable
└── Target: 65-70% total sink rate

3. Item Binding
├── Legendary items: Bind on Equip (BoE)
├── Elite content drops: Bind on Pickup (BoP)
├── Crafted items: Tradeable (market supply)
└── Prevents infinite item circulation

4. Material Decay
├── Teef natural decay: 1%/week
├── Consider for materials if inflation exceeds targets
└── Emergency option: All currencies decay 0.5%/week
```

## B. Monitoring Metrics

```
ECONOMIC HEALTH INDICATORS

Track Weekly:
├── Total gold in circulation
├── Average gold per player (by segment)
├── Median gold per player
├── Gini coefficient
├── Transaction volume (AH + direct trades)
├── Price indices (T3, T4, T5 gear)

Alert Thresholds:
├── Gini > 0.55: Monitor closely
├── Gini > 0.60: Consider intervention
├── Inflation > 5%/month: Increase sink rates
├── Inflation > 8%/month: Emergency measures
├── T5 price double in 3 months: Supply issue

Monthly Reports:
├── Wealth distribution charts
├── Sink effectiveness by type
├── Exploit detection summary
├── Market health assessment
└── Recommended adjustments
```

## C. Emergency Interventions

```
INTERVENTION OPTIONS

Soft Interventions:
├── Increase existing sink rates (repair costs, fees)
├── Release new prestige sinks (limited-time items)
├── Event-based gold drains (competitive donations)
└── Bonus materials drop rate (shift value to materials)

Hard Interventions:
├── Enable progressive taxation
├── Gold → New Currency conversion events
├── Fresh server launches with economy reset
└── Expansion with new tier (partial reset)

Never Do:
├── Arbitrary gold deletion
├── Punishing players for playing
├── Sudden, unannounced changes
└── Removing trading capabilities
```

# XI. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

## A. For Combat Designer

```
COMBAT → ECONOMY INTEGRATION

Boss Rewards (Within Diminishing Returns):
├── World Boss: 500-1,000g (counts toward daily cap)
├── Elite Boss: 300-600g
├── Dungeon Boss: 200-400g
├── Story Boss: 150-300g (once per character)
└── All boss gold goes through diminishing returns system

Material Drops:
├── Follow Resource Designer's tables
├── No change to drop rates from economy side
└── Market will price based on supply/demand

Lockout Timers:
├── World Boss: Daily lockout (24 hours)
├── Elite Dungeon: Weekly lockout
├── Story Content: One-time per character
└── Prevents gold farming through repeated kills
```

## B. For Resource Designer

```
RESOURCE → ECONOMY INTEGRATION

Material Pricing Guidelines:
├── T3 material player price target: 75-150g
├── T4 material player price target: 400-800g
├── T5 material player price target: 3,000-6,000g
└── If prices exceed 200% of target, increase drop rates

Crafting Fee Adjustments (Arbitrage Fix):
├── T3 crafting fee: 15% of vendor output value
├── T4 crafting fee: 15% of vendor output value
├── T5 crafting fee: 20% of vendor output value
├── Legendary fee: 25% of vendor output value
└── Fees are FIXED (based on vendor price, not market)

Material Sink Rate:
├── Target: 80% of gathered materials consumed
├── Monitor stockpiling behavior
├── If hoarding detected: Consider storage fees or stack decay
```

## C. For Progression Designer

```
PROGRESSION → ECONOMY INTEGRATION

Skill Unlock Costs:
├── Standard skills: Skill points only (no gold)
├── Elite skills: Skill points + Requisition Tokens
├── Prestige skills: Skill points + Gold (5,000-20,000g)
└── Purpose: Gold sink at endgame skill acquisition

Reputation Rewards:
├── Gold rewards scale with reputation tier
├── Exalted unlock: One-time 10,000g bonus
├── Reputation items: Priced for economic milestone targets
└── Purpose: Reward long-term engagement
```

---

# XII. LAUNCH CONSIDERATIONS

## A. New Server Bootstrap

```
FIRST 3 MONTHS: BOOTSTRAP MODE

Vendor Adjustments:
├── Vendor buy prices reduced 40% (months 1-2)
├── Vendor buy prices reduced 20% (month 3)
├── Normal prices (month 4+)
└── Purpose: Enable progression without player market

Supply Injection:
├── Quest rewards include more materials (month 1)
├── Crafting tutorials provide materials for first gear
├── World events drop tradeable materials
└── Purpose: Seed player market

Price Monitoring:
├── Daily price checks for essential items
├── If T3 gear exceeds 20,000g: Inject supply
├── If T3 gear below 2,000g: Reduce quest rewards
└── Purpose: Keep prices in target range
```

## B. Server Merge Considerations

```
SERVER MERGE PROTOCOL

Before Merge:
├── Snapshot all player gold
├── Calculate server-specific inflation rate
├── Identify wealth outliers

During Merge:
├── Normalize gold based on relative inflation
├── Combined cap on transferred gold (500,000g max)
├── Excess converted to non-tradeable prestige items
└── Purpose: Prevent inflation bomb

After Merge:
├── Monitor for 30 days
├── Watch for price manipulation
├── Adjust sink rates if needed
```

# XIII. SUMMARY

This economy design addresses all simulator findings:

**Simulator Issue → Solution:**
1. Income caps ineffective → Diminishing returns system
2. Endgame gold sinks insufficient → Tiered prestige system (50k-2M gold)
3. Player archetypes vague → Explicit hour/income definitions
4. Novel item RMT vulnerability → Baseline value system for all items
5. T3 crafting arbitrage → Reduced vendor buy price, increased crafting fees
6. Long-term inflation → Multi-layer sinks + monitoring + emergency valves
7. Wealth concentration → Progressive taxation ready as emergency option

**Core Philosophy Preserved:**
- Guild Wars 1 player-driven economy
- Vendors as floor/ceiling, not primary market
- Faction identity in economic systems
- Meaningful wealth at all stages
