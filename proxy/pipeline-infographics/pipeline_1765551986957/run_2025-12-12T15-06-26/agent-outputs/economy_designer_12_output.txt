Looking at the simulation results, I need to design an economy system that addresses the identified issues while maintaining the solid foundation from the resource design. Let me create a comprehensive economy design.

---

# Economy Systems Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. MARKET PHILOSOPHY

Following Guild Wars 1's approach: **markets should facilitate play, not become the game**. Players engage with economic systems to enhance their combat experience, not as an end unto themselves.

**Core Principles:**
- Trading is a tool, not a profession
- Price transparency prevents exploitation
- Regional markets create interesting choices
- Sinks scale with wealth, not just activity

---

# II. NPC VENDOR SYSTEMS

## A. Vendor Types

### 1. General Merchants (Fixed Pricing)
Present in all settlements. Sell basic consumables, materials, and utility items.

```
GENERAL MERCHANT INVENTORY

Category         | Items                      | Price Model
-----------------|----------------------------|-------------
Basic Consumables| T1-T2 Stimms, Rations      | Fixed
Ammunition       | Infinite, all types        | Fixed (free)

Basic Materials  | T1 crafting materials      | Fixed
Travel Items     | Waystones, Beacons         | Fixed

Price Stability: 100% (never changes)
Stock: Unlimited
```

### 2. Specialty Merchants (Semi-Dynamic)
Faction-specific vendors with rotating stock and reputation discounts.

```

```
BLACK MARKET MECHANICS

Location: Neutral settlements only
Hours: Available 24/7 but prices shift every 4 hours

Price Formula:
Base Price × Supply Modifier × Demand Modifier × Faction Modifier

Supply Modifier (based on recent sales to vendor):
├── Oversupplied (>200% normal): 0.75x buy price
├── Normal supply: 1.0x
├── Undersupplied (<50% normal): 1.25x buy price

Demand Modifier (based on recent purchases from vendor):
├── High demand (>200% normal): 1.35x sell price
├── Normal demand: 1.0x
├── Low demand (<50% normal): 0.80x sell price

├── Allied faction goods: -5% discount

Price Bounds:
├── Minimum: 50% of base
├── Maximum: 200% of base
└── Change rate: Max ±10% per 4-hour cycle
```

---

# III. AUCTION HOUSE SYSTEM

## A. Structure

### Regional Auction Houses
Separate markets per region prevent instant arbitrage while allowing dedicated traders to profit.

```
AUCTION HOUSE REGIONS

Region          | Primary Trade           | Price Tendency
----------------|-------------------------|---------------
Core Worlds     | Reference point         | 1.0x baseline
Forge Worlds    | Metals, Tech            | 0.8x metals, 1.2x organics
Frontier Worlds | Organics, Consumables   | 0.8x organics, 1.2x metals
War Zones       | Salvage, Requisition    | 0.65x all*, 1.3x consumables
Tau Space       | Tau goods only          | 0.9x Tau, 1.5x Imperial
Ork Territory   | Ork goods, gambling     | 0.7x everything**, high variance

* War Zone discount reflects battlefield salvage
** Ork economy is inherently cheaper but chaotic
```

### Listing Mechanics
```
AUCTION HOUSE LISTING

Listing Fee: 3% of listing price (non-refundable)
Sale Fee: 6% of sale price (on successful sale)
Total Fee: 9% (5% listing + 10% sale reduced to 3% + 6%)

Duration Options:
├── 6 hours: Base fee
├── 24 hours: 1.25x fee
├── 72 hours: 1.5x fee
└── 7 days: 2x fee

Listing Limits:
├── Per character: 30 active listings
├── Per account: 100 active listings
└── Premium (earned): +20 listings
```

### Buyout vs. Bidding
```
AUCTION TYPES

Buyout Only: Instant purchase at fixed price
├── Default option
├── 90% of all listings
└── Simpler, faster

Auction Style: Bidding with optional buyout
├── Minimum bid starts at 50% of buyout
├── Bid increments: 5% minimum
├── Anti-snipe: Bids in last 5 min extend by 5 min
└── Used for rare/valuable items

Reserved: Private listing visible only to specified player
├── Same fees apply
├── Cannot be searched
├── Used for pre-arranged trades
```

## B. Search and Discovery

```
AUCTION HOUSE INTERFACE

Search Filters:
├── Category (Weapons, Armor, Materials, etc.)
├── Subcategory (Lasgun, Bolter, Plasma, etc.)
├── Tier (T1-T5, Legendary)
├── Price Range (min-max)
├── Time Remaining
├── Faction Affiliation
└── Stat Filters (damage, armor, etc.)

Sort Options:
├── Price (low-high, high-low)
├── Time Remaining
├── Recently Listed
└── Most Bids

Price History:
├── Shows last 30 days of sales
├── Average, min, max prices
├── Volume traded
└── Trend indicator (rising/falling/stable)
```

## C. Fee Structure (Revised)

Addressing the simulation concern about AH vs Direct Trade:

```
REVISED FEE COMPARISON

Auction House:
├── Listing fee: 3%
├── Sale fee: 6%
├── Total: 9%
├── Benefits: Price discovery, buyer protection, convenience

Direct Trade:
├── Fee: 3% flat (up from 2%)
├── Minimum fee: 100g (prevents micro-trade spam)
├── Benefits: Privacy, negotiation

Result: AH premium reduced to 6% over direct trade
├── Still incentivizes AH use for small/medium trades
├── Direct trade viable for large known-buyer trades
└── Prevents AH abandonment for high-value items
```

---

# IV. PLAYER-TO-PLAYER TRADING

## A. Direct Trade

```

---

# V. PRICING FORMULAS

## A. Base Price Calculations

```
ITEM BASE PRICE FORMULA

Equipment:
Base Price = (Material Cost × 1.2) + (Tier Multiplier × 100) + Rarity Bonus

Material Cost = Sum of (Material Qty × Material Vendor Price)
Tier Multiplier = Tier² (T1=1, T2=4, T3=9, T4=16, T5=25)
Rarity Bonus = 0/100/500/2000/10000 (Common to Legendary)

Example - T3 Rare Lasgun:
├── Materials: 150g worth
├── Tier: 3² × 100 = 900g
├── Rarity: 500g
└── Base Price: (150 × 1.2) + 900 + 500 = 1,580g

Consumables:
Base Price = (Material Cost × 1.1) + (Effect Value × Duration Modifier)

Effect Value: Damage buff = 2g per 1% per second
Duration Modifier: Instant = 5x, 30sec = 3x, 60sec = 2x, 5min = 1x

Example - T2 Stimm Pack (+15% damage, 30 sec):
├── Materials: 20g
├── Effect: 15 × 30 × 2 = 900 effect points ÷ 30 = 30g
└── Base Price: (20 × 1.1) + 30 = 52g (rounded to 50g)
```

## B. Dynamic Price Bounds

```
MARKET PRICE BOUNDS

Player Market (AH):
├── Minimum list price: 10% of NPC vendor buy price
├── Maximum list price: 1000% of base price
├── Practical range: 50%-200% of base price
└── Prices outside 50-200% flagged as unusual

NPC Dynamic Vendors:
├── Minimum: 50% of base
├── Maximum: 200% of base
├── Change rate: ±10% per cycle (4 hours)
└── Influenced by server-wide supply/demand

Emergency Price Floors:
├── If item average drops below 20% of base for 7 days
├── NPC vendor buy price increases to 25% of base
├── Creates artificial demand floor
└── Prevents total market collapse of item categories
```

## C. Repair Cost Formula (Revised - Addressing Sink Issue)

```
REPAIR COST FORMULA (UPDATED)

Old Formula: Base Repair = Item Base Price × 0.05
New Formula: Base Repair = (Item Base Price × 0.08) + (Tier × 50)

Death Penalty Multiplier (unchanged at 50%)

Example - T5 Weapon (Base Price 5,000g):
├── Old full repair: 5000 × 0.05 = 250g
├── New full repair: (5000 × 0.08) + (5 × 50) = 400 + 250 = 650g
├── Death repair: 325g
└── Increase: 160% (addresses endgame sink deficit)

Weekly Repair Impact (Dedicated Player):
├── Old: ~1,000g
├── New: ~2,600g
├── Additional sink: +1,600g/week
```

# XI. REGIONAL ECONOMY MECHANICS

## A. Price Variance by Region

```
REGIONAL PRICE MODIFIERS

                    Metals  Organics  Tech  Energy  Consumables
Core Worlds         1.0x    1.0x      1.0x  1.0x    1.0x
Forge Worlds        0.8x    1.2x      0.85x 0.9x    1.1x
Frontier Worlds     1.2x    0.8x      1.1x  1.0x    0.85x
War Zones           0.65x   0.65x     0.65x 0.65x   1.3x

* Ork prices are base lower but have ±20% random variance
```

## B. Arbitrage System (Fixed)

```
ARBITRAGE MECHANICS (REVISED)

Per-Account Daily Limits:
├── Cross-region material transport: 50 units/account/day
├── Tracks across all characters
├── Resets at daily server reset
└── Cannot be circumvented by mail

Travel Cost Reduction (Fixing War Zone Route):
├── War Zone travel: 400g → 250g
├── Makes war zone arbitrage viable

Example Route (War Zone → Core):
├── Buy price (War Zone): 25g × 0.65 = 16.25g
├── Travel cost: 250g
├── Sell price (Core): 25g
├── Profit per unit: 8.75g
├── Break-even: 29 units
├── Daily capacity: 50 units
├── Daily profit: (50-29) × 8.75g = 184g
├── Time investment: ~30 minutes
├── Gold/hour: ~368g

Assessment:
├── Comparable to standard farming (~300-400g/hour)
├── Requires knowledge and planning
├── Rewards engaged players without being exploitative
└── Status: BALANCED ✓
```

## C. Regional Events Affecting Prices

```

├── 501-750 Teef earned: 75% value
├── 751-1,000 Teef earned: 50% value
├── 1,001+ Teef earned: 25% value

Effective Weekly Maximum:
├── Raw: 500 + 187 + 125 + (∞ × 0.25)
├── Practical cap: ~900 effective Teef/week
├── Prevents infinite accumulation
├── Maintains "wild" Ork feel

Decay (Unchanged):
├── 0.25% weekly decay
├── Floor: 100 Teef minimum
└── Thematic: Teef rot

Cross-Faction Exchange:
├── Teef can be converted to Imperial Thrones
├── Rate: 1 Teef = 3-5 Thrones (variable)
├── Only at Black Market dealers
├── Daily limit: 200 Teef converted
└── Prevents Teef from dominating all-faction economy
```

```
TAU INTERNAL ECONOMY

```

## C. Imperial Economy

```
IMPERIAL INTERNAL ECONOMY

Ecclesiarchy Tithe System:
├── Optional gold donations to shrines
├── 1 Piety Mark per 10g donated
├── Weekly cap: 500 Piety Marks
├── ROI: Slow but provides unique rewards

Mechanicus Data-Tithe:
├── 10% of Data-Tithes earned must be "uploaded"
├── Creates community pool for shared bonuses
├── Players can see contribution leaderboards
└── Top contributors get special recognition

Militarum Requisition Economy:
├── Requisition earned through military content
├── Cannot be traded between players
├── Weekly maintenance: Rank × 25 Requisition
└── Creates "use it or lose it" pressure
