# II. EXPLOITS FOUND

## A. Critical Exploits (Game-Breaking)

```
NO CRITICAL EXPLOITS FOUND ✓

The following potential exploits are BLOCKED:

1. Vendor Arbitrage → BLOCKED
   ├── T3 equipment: Buy from vendor 800g, sell 100g = No profit
   ├── All tiers: Spread prevents resale profit
   └── Status: SECURE

2. Cross-Region Arbitrage → BLOCKED
   ├── 15% cross-region fee eliminates small price gaps
   ├── Only profitable at >20% price difference
   └── Status: SECURE

3. Alt Account Goldflow → BLOCKED
   ├── New account restrictions (2 week wait)
   ├── Same IP shares daily cap
   ├── Gift limitations
   └── Status: SECURE
```

## B. Moderate Exploits (Economy Damaging)

```
EXPLOIT #1: TEEF ARBITRAGE (MODERATE RISK)

Mechanism:
├── Buy Teef with gold: 1g = 0.9 Teef
├── Sell Teef for gold: 1 Teef = 1.2g
├── Round trip: 1g → 0.9 Teef → 1.08g
├── Net gain: 8% per cycle
└── Risk: Exploitable at scale

Mitigation Required:
├── Add 24-hour cooldown between conversions
├── OR reverse the conversion rates
├── Recommended: 1g = 0.85 Teef, 1 Teef = 1.0g
└── Status: NEEDS FIX

---

EXPLOIT #2: EVENT VENDOR FRONT-RUNNING (MODERATE RISK)

Mechanism:
├── Rare vendors announced 30 minutes early
├── Players hoard gold for events
├── Mass purchases at event vendors
├── Resale after event ends
└── Risk: Creates artificial scarcity/windfall

Mitigation Required:
├── Event items should be account-bound or
├── Stagger event vendor stock (not all at once)
├── Recommended: Event cosmetics = account-bound
└── Status: NEEDS POLICY CLARITY

---

EXPLOIT #3: REPUTATION DISCOUNT STACKING EDGE CASE

Mechanism:
├── Exalted reputation: 20% discount
├── Regional specialty: 15-20% discount
├── Documentation states 30% cap
├── BUT: Corruption system ("expedited service") is additional
├── Potential total: 30% + corruption = undefined
└── Risk: Corruption pricing not defined

Mitigation Required:
├── Define corruption pricing explicitly
├── Corruption should ADD cost, not reduce
├── Recommended: Corruption = +10-50% for faster service
└── Status: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
```

## C. Minor Exploits (Nuisance Level)

```
EXPLOIT #4: DAILY RESET TIMING (MINOR)

Mechanism:
├── Hit daily cap, wait for reset
├── Immediately farm again
├── Over 2 days: 17,000g instead of 16,000g
├── Gain: ~1,000g/day for dedicated timing
└── Risk: Minor advantage, high effort

Recommendation:
├── Accept as "dedicated player reward"
├── Already gated by diminishing returns
└── Status: ACCEPTABLE

---

EXPLOIT #5: AH LISTING FEE AVOIDANCE (MINOR)

Mechanism:
├── List items at high price (5% fee paid)
├── Cancel before sale
├── Re-list at proper price
├── Issue: Multiple cancellations = fee farming
└── Risk: Actually costs the player, self-punishing

Recommendation:
├── Already self-punishing (loses 5% each time)
├── Add: 3 cancellations = 24-hour listing cooldown
└── Status: MONITOR ONLY
```

# III. BALANCE ISSUES

## A. Sink Rate Insufficiency (Mid-Game)

```
ISSUE: MID-GAME SINK RATE TOO LOW

Data:
├── Target sink rate: 65-70%
├── Actual mid-game sink: 51%
├── Gap: 14-19 percentage points

Root Cause:
├── Optional sinks not compelling
├── Faction donations lack incentive
├── Prestige items too expensive for mid-game
└── Mid-game players hoarding for T4

Impact:
├── Gold accumulates in mid-game
├── Feeds into late-game inflation
├── Players feel "nothing to spend on"
└── Severity: MODERATE

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Add mid-game prestige tier (15,000-40,000g)
├── Skill visual effects: Reduce from 40,000g to 15,000g
├── Mount speed upgrades: 25,000g
├── Personal stash expansion: 20,000g
└── Target: Increase mid-game sink to 60%
```

## B. T4 Gear Price Gap

```
ISSUE: T4 GEAR ACQUISITION GAP

Data:
├── T3 set: 8,000g (1.5 weeks casual)
├── T4 set: 40,000g (7 weeks casual)
├── Gap multiplier: 5x price, 4.7x time
├── Expected: Smooth progression curve

Problem:
├── Jump from T3 to T4 feels like hitting wall
├── Players plateau at T3 for extended period
├── May cause player frustration/churn
└── Severity: MODERATE

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Reduce T4 set target to 30,000g
├── Adjust vendor buy price: 4,000g → 3,000g
├── Adjust expected market: ~30,000g set
├── New timeline: 5 weeks casual (more reasonable)
└── Alternative: Add T3.5 "Elite T3" tier
```

## C. Hardcore Player Currency Cap Frustration

```
ISSUE: HARDCORE PLAYERS HIT CEILING

Data:
├── Soft cap: ~8,500g/day
├── Hardcore 40+ hours: Hit cap by hour 4-5
├── Remaining playtime: Feels unrewarded
└── Severity: MODERATE

Problem:
├── After cap, gold feels pointless
├── May push players to seek non-gold rewards
├── Could feel punitive
└── Design intent was anti-RMT, but affects legitimate players

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Shift high-end rewards to materials, not gold
├── Elite content: Reduce gold, increase rare material drops
├── Post-cap play should feel rewarding in OTHER ways
├── Consider: After cap, 5% gold converts to faction currency
└── Maintains anti-RMT while rewarding continued play
```

## D. Ork Economy Volatility

```
ISSUE: ORK ECONOMY TOO VOLATILE

Data:
├── Vendor prices: ±20% hourly fluctuation
├── 10% total spread + 20% random = 30% potential swing
├── Players can wait for optimal prices
└── Creates analysis paralysis

Problem:
├── Ork players may avoid vendors entirely
├── Or camp vendors waiting for good prices
├── Neither behavior is fun
└── Severity: MINOR (Ork-specific)

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Reduce fluctuation: ±10% (not ±20%)
├── Add "Ork Luck": Random bonus items instead
├── Volatility should be fun, not frustrating
└── Keep haggling minigame as main differentiator
```

---

# IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

## A. Critical Fixes (Before Launch)

```
FIX #1: TEEF CONVERSION RATES
├── Current: 1g = 0.9 Teef, 1 Teef = 1.2g (8% arbitrage)
├── Fixed: 1g = 0.85 Teef, 1 Teef = 1.0g (15% loss round-trip)
├── Rationale: Conversion should cost, not profit
└── Priority: HIGH

FIX #2: CORRUPTION SYSTEM PRICING
├── Current: Undefined
├── Fixed: Corruption = +10% to +50% ADDITIONAL cost
├── Purpose: Pay MORE for faster service (not discount)
└── Priority: HIGH

FIX #3: EVENT ITEM BINDING
├── Current: Cosmetic only (tradeable implied)
├── Fixed: Event exclusives = Account-bound for 30 days
├── Rationale: Prevents front-running and speculation
└── Priority: HIGH
```

## B. Balance Adjustments (Before Launch)

```
ADJUSTMENT #1: ADD MID-GAME PRESTIGE TIER

New Items:
├── Skill visual effects: 15,000g (reduced from 40,000g)
├── Personal stash tab: 20,000g
├── Mount speed upgrade: 25,000g
├── Armor dye packs (rare): 10,000g
├── Weapon trail effects: 18,000g
└── Purpose: 15,000-25,000g sink tier for mid-game

ADJUSTMENT #2: REDUCE T4 SET PRICING

Changes:
├── T4 vendor buy price: 4,000g → 3,000g
├── Expected market set price: 40,000g → 30,000g
├── Crafting fee maintained at 15%
└── Timeline: 7 weeks casual → 5 weeks casual

ADJUSTMENT #3: ORK VENDOR VOLATILITY

Changes:
├── Price fluctuation: ±20% → ±10%
├── Add random bonus drops (1-5% chance per purchase)
├── Keep haggling minigame unchanged
└── Purpose: Fun chaos, not frustrating chaos

ADJUSTMENT #4: POST-CAP CONVERSION

Add System:
├── After daily gold cap reached
├── 5% of "would-be" gold converts to faction currency
├── Weekly cap on faction currency still applies
├── Overflow: Converts to 1-hour XP boost
└── Purpose: Reward continued play without gold inflation
```

## C. Monitoring Thresholds

```
LAUNCH MONITORING (First 90 Days)

Daily Checks:
├── Average gold per active player
├── Median gold per active player
├── Top 1% gold holdings

# VI. FINAL VERDICT

## Summary Assessment

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| New Player Experience | ✅ HEALTHY | Clear progression, feels rewarding |
| Mid-Game Economy | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Sink rate low, T4 gap too large |
| Endgame Economy | ✅ HEALTHY | Strong sinks, meaningful goals |
| Inflation Control | ✅ HEALTHY | Diminishing returns effective |
| Exploit Prevention | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Teef arbitrage, corruption undefined |
| Long-Term Stability | ✅ HEALTHY | Monitoring system robust |

## Critical Items

1. **MUST FIX**: Teef conversion arbitrage (8% free money)
2. **MUST FIX**: Define corruption pricing (currently undefined)
3. **SHOULD FIX**: Add mid-game prestige tier (15k-25k range)
4. **SHOULD FIX**: Reduce T4 set pricing from 40k to 30k
5. **MINOR**: Reduce Ork vendor volatility

## Verdict

The economy design is fundamentally sound with Guild Wars 1-style player-driven markets, robust anti-RMT protections, and comprehensive sink systems. However, several balance issues and one exploit require attention before approval.

The Teef arbitrage loop creates an infinite money exploit that must be fixed. The mid-game sink gap and T4 pricing cliff will cause player frustration and contribute to long-term inflation.

With the recommended fixes applied, this economy should support a healthy, sustainable game for years.

---

**VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING**

Required changes:
- Fix Teef conversion rates to eliminate arbitrage
- Define corruption system pricing explicitly
- Add mid-game prestige sink tier
- Reduce T4 set pricing gap

Once these four items are addressed, the economy can be approved for implementation.
