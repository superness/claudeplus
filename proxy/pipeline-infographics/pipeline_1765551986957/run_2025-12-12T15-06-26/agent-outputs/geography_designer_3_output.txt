# VII. GEOGRAPHY-LORE INTEGRATION

## Ancient Battlefields as Geographic Features

### The Bone Fields (Mourning Fields)
- M34 Ork invasion created mass graves
- Soil enriched by billions of dead
- Occasional Ork weapons surface during farming
- Ghost stories fuel religious content

### The Titan Graves (Forge Damocles)
- Fallen war machines form mountain ranges
- Each grave site a dungeon
- Plasma cores still leak, creating hot zones
- Mechanicus pilgrimages to "honor the fallen"

### No Man's World
- 200 years of continuous warfare
- Original geography completely erased
- Trenches deeper than original mountains were tall
- No natural features remain

## Sacred Mountains and Their Stories

### Mount Avalos (Avalos Prime)
- Where Saint Avalos made her final stand
- Perpetually wreathed in flame (volcanic vents)
- Pilgrimage summit every Imperial holiday
- End-game Faith questline culminates here

### The Ethereal Peaks (T'ros Prime)
- Tau renamed human mountain range
- Original colony's escape route (lore discovery)
- Secret human resistance cells in caves
- Cross-faction story content

### Da Big 'Un (Gutrippa's Rok)
- Largest asteroid in the space hulk
- Warboss Gutrippa's personal territory
- Size indicates status in Ork culture
- Succession fights occur here

## How Geography Shapes Warfare

### Imperial Doctrine
- Fortress worlds with layered defenses
- Population concentrated behind walls
- Industry in hostile environments (defense through difficulty)
- Sacred sites as strategic objectives (will fight to death)

### Tau Doctrine
- Mobile bases, no permanent fortifications
- Control terrain with range and technology
- Weather manipulation as warfare
- Retreat is acceptable (live to fight better)

### Ork Doctrine
- Wherever they are becomes Ork territory
- Terrain changes to suit them (fungal spread)
- Fight anywhere, any conditions
- Destroy geography they don't like

## Key Geographic Principles

1. **Triangular Conflict:** Three factions occupy distinct corners of the sector, creating natural fronts
2. **Resource Scarcity:** No faction is self-sufficient, driving conflict over resources
3. **Chokepoints:** Limited travel routes create strategic objectives
4. **Environmental Storytelling:** Every location's geography tells its history
5. **Gameplay Variety:** Each biome offers distinct gameplay experiences
6. **Faction Identity:** Geography reflects faction philosophy (Imperial fortress, Tau clean, Ork chaotic)
