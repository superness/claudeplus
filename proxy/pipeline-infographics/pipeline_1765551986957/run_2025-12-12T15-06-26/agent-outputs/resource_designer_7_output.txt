# I. RESOURCE PHILOSOPHY

This game draws from Guild Wars 1's resource philosophy: **meaningful scarcity without tedious grinding**. Resources should create interesting decisions, not time gates. Every resource has multiple uses, multiple acquisition paths, and clear value propositions.

**Core Principles:**
- No resource exists solely to be hoarded
- Every resource flows through multiple systems
- Faction identity extends to resource types
- Resources tell stories about the world

# VI. RESOURCE FLOW BETWEEN SYSTEMS

## A. Economy System Integration

```
RESOURCE → ECONOMY FLOW

Combat Drops → Vendor Sales → Currency → Market Purchases
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓
Crafting Mats → Crafted Goods → Trade → Player Economy
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓
Salvage ← ← ← ← Equipment ← ← ← Currency ← ← Gold Sinks
```

### Key Economic Loops
1. **Combat Loop:** Kill enemies → Get drops → Sell or craft → Get better gear → Kill harder enemies
2. **Crafting Loop:** Gather materials → Craft items → Sell to players → Buy rare materials
3. **Trading Loop:** Acquire surplus → Trade for needs → Complete builds → Generate new surplus

## B. Combat System Integration

```
RESOURCE → COMBAT FLOW

Consumables → Combat Buffs → Victory → Better Drops
     ↓            ↓           ↓            ↓
Crafting ← ← Materials ← ← Loot ← ← ← Enemies
     ↓            ↓           ↓            ↓
Equipment → Better Stats → Harder Content → Rare Resources
```

### Combat Resource Dependencies
- **Consumables:** Required for competitive play, farmable for casual
- **Ammunition:** Infinite (no ammo resource - keeps combat flowing)
- **Repair Costs:** Scale with gear tier (gold sink)
- **Resurrection:** Limited uses per mission (consumable or cooldown)

## C. Progression System Integration

```
RESOURCE → PROGRESSION FLOW

Experience → Skill Points → Skill Unlocks → Build Diversity
     ↓            ↓              ↓               ↓
Reputation → Faction Rank → Exclusive Content → Unique Resources
     ↓            ↓              ↓               ↓
Materials → Crafted Gear → Power Increase → Content Access
```

### Progression Resource Gates
- **Story Progress:** Gated by quest completion, not resources
- **Skill Access:** Gated by skill points and reputation
- **Equipment Tiers:** Soft-gated by material availability
- **Elite Content:** Gated by gear quality and player skill

# XI. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**For Economy Designer:**
- Currency generation rates balanced against sink targets
- Player trading requires auction house fee structure
- Faction currencies create micro-economies within macro-economy

**For Combat Designer:**
- Consumable power levels must not trivialize content
- Drop rates should feel rewarding without flooding markets
- Elite content must justify material investment

**For Progression Designer:**
- Skill point acquisition should feel steady, not grindy
- Reputation gates should guide, not block
- Material requirements should encourage content variety
