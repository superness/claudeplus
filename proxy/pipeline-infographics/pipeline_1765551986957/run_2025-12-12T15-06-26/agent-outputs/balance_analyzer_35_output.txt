## Combat Balance Analysis Complete

### 1. BALANCE ANALYSIS

Created comprehensive DPS calculations across all game phases:
- **Early Game (1-10):** Acceptable balance, DPS range 35-52 sustained
- **Mid Game (11-30):** Berserker and Psyker begin dominating (95-110 DPS vs 55-88 average)
- **End Game (30+):** Severe imbalance with Berserker at 180 DPS sustained, 380 burst

### 2. DOMINANT STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED

| Build | Severity | Issue |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Berserker Blood Rage | HIGH | 2.7x damage multiplier stack reaches 607 DPS |
| Psyker + Tech-Priest | CRITICAL | Infinite energy loop = unlimited casting |
| Necron Reanimation | MEDIUM | Self-heal exceeds incoming damage = immortality |
| Space Marine Terminator | MEDIUM | 180 armor + Feel No Pain = 4,800 effective HP |

### 3. WEAK OPTIONS

- **Imperial Guard "Fix Bayonets!"** - 44% damage deficit, useless
- **Cultist Class** - No viable endgame role, outclassed in all areas
- **Eldar Spirit Stone** - 4s cast = always interrupted
- **Tau Melee Skills** - Trap options with 12 base damage vs 25 average
- **Ork "Dakka" Build** - Energy starved (25 pool, 35 skill cost)

### 4. EXPLOITS FOUND (5 Critical)

1. **"For the Emperor!" Infinite Duration** - Permanent +50% party damage
2. **Death Mark One-Shot** - Guaranteed kill at 50% HP
3. **Daemon Summoning Stack** - 680 free DPS from 8 summons
4. **Tyranid Synapse Chain** - 11.2 players worth of power from 8
5. **Necron Resurrection Loop** - Infinite self-revives

### 5. RECOMMENDATIONS

**Immediate Nerfs:**
- Berserker Blood Rage: +5% → +3% per point
- Skulls for Khorne: +50% → +20% damage
- Warp Siphon energy return: 10 → 5
- New armor cap at 150

**Immediate Buffs:**
- Ork energy pool: 25 → 35
- Cultist HP: 420 → 480
- Imperial Guard Bayonets: 25 → 55 damage

**New Systems Required:**
- Diminishing returns on buff stacking
- Boss immunity thresholds
- Summon limits per party

### 6. VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING

The core GW1-style combat framework is sound, but 5 critical exploits and significant class imbalance require tuning before approval. Berserker dominance will centralize meta, Psyker+Tech-Priest infinite loop will trivialize PvE, and Cultist has no endgame viability.
