# Economy Systems Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Following Guild Wars 1's economic principles: **Trading should be accessible, fair, and support player agency without enabling exploitation.** The economy exists to facilitate player goals, not gatekeep them.

**Core Principles:**
- Player-to-player trading is the heart of the economy
- NPC vendors provide floor/ceiling price anchors
- Multiple currency sinks prevent runaway inflation
- Faction identity creates economic niches, not barriers
- No feature should enable real-money trading (RMT)

**For Combat Designer:**
- Drop rates calibrated for 65% sink efficiency
- Boss rewards are significant but not economy-breaking
- PvP rewards modest (prevents farming alts)

**For Progression Designer:**
- Skill costs create meaningful choices, not barriers
- Reputation gates have economic components
- Equipment tiers have clear cost escalation

**For Resource Designer:**
- Material sinks integrated with crafting fees
- Conversion rates support market balance
- Faction materials create trading opportunities
