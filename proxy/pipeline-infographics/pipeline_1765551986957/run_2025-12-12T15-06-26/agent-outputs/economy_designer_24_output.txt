# Economy Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's economic design: **trading should be meaningful but not mandatory**. A solo player can progress entirely through NPC vendors and personal crafting. A social player gains efficiency through trading, not necessity. The economy rewards engagement without punishing isolation.

**Core Principles:**
- NPC vendors provide baseline pricing anchor
- Player trading offers better deals but requires effort
- Money sinks scale with wealth, not just activity
- Regional price differences encourage exploration
- Faction economies create cross-faction interaction opportunities

# II. MARKET SYSTEM MECHANICS

## A. NPC Vendor System

### Vendor Types

```
VENDOR TAXONOMY

GENERAL MERCHANTS (Every Hub)
├── Sell: Basic consumables, T1-T2 materials, ammunition
├── Buy: All vendorable items at fixed prices
├── Refresh: Unlimited stock
└── Prices: Fixed, universal

SPECIALIST VENDORS (Major Hubs Only)
├── Sell: Faction-specific items, T2-T3 equipment
├── Buy: Related items at 25% premium over general
├── Refresh: Limited stock, 6-hour refresh
└── Prices: Fixed, may vary by location (±10%)

FACTION QUARTERMASTERS (Faction Strongholds)
├── Sell: Elite equipment, faction exclusives
├── Buy: Faction materials only
├── Requires: Faction reputation
└── Prices: Requisition Tokens + Currency hybrid

TRAVELING MERCHANTS (Random Spawns)
├── Sell: Rare materials, unique items, cross-faction goods
├── Buy: Specialty items at premium prices
├── Spawn: 2-4 hour windows, announced server-wide
└── Prices: Dynamic based on server supply

NEUTRAL TRADERS (Cross-Faction Zones)
├── Sell: Cross-faction material conversion
├── Buy: Materials from any faction
├── Access: Requires neutral reputation
└── Prices: Premium (150% standard)
```

### Vendor Pricing Model

**Fixed Price Anchors (NPC Buy Prices)**
```
BASE VENDOR BUY PRICES

Materials:
├── T1: 1 Throne
├── T2: 5 Thrones
├── T3: 25 Thrones
├── T4: 150 Thrones
└── T5: Cannot vendor (tradeable only)

Equipment (Sell only - NPCs don't sell equipment T3+):
├── T1: 10 Thrones
├── T2: 50 Thrones
├── T3: 200 Thrones
├── T4: 800 Thrones
└── T5+: Cannot vendor

Consumables:
├── T1: 2 Thrones
├── T2: 10 Thrones
├── T3: 50 Thrones
└── T4: 200 Thrones
```

**NPC Sell Prices (Always higher than buy)**
```
NPC SELL MARKUP

Standard markup: 5x buy price
├── T1 Material: 5 Thrones
├── T2 Material: 25 Thrones
├── T3 Material: 150 Thrones
└── T4 Material: 1000 Thrones

This creates player trading opportunity:
Player trade range = 1.5x to 4x vendor buy price
(Beats vendor buy, undercuts vendor sell)
```
