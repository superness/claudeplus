# Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Combat System Design Document
## Guild Wars 1-Style Combat for the 41st Millennium

---

# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's legendary combat design, this system prioritizes **build diversity over vertical power**. Combat should reward tactical thinking, team composition, and skill timing rather than gear score or level advantages.

**Core Principles:**
- **8-Skill Bar:** Limited but meaningful choices
- **Energy Management:** Skills cost resources, creating decision points
- **Build Synergy:** Skills interact, creating emergent strategies
- **Horizontal Progression:** A level 20 with a bad build loses to level 15 with a good build
- **No Holy Trinity Lock:** Support, control, and damage can blend

# II. CORE COMBAT MECHANICS

## A. Combat Flow (Real-Time with Tactical Pause)

```
COMBAT TIMING STRUCTURE

Action Speed:
├── Attack Speed: 1.0-2.0 attacks/second (base)
├── Skill Activation: 0.25s - 3.0s cast times
├── Aftercast Delay: 0.5s - 1.0s recovery
├── Global Cooldown: 0.75s (prevents spam)
└── Movement: Full mobility during most casts

Combat States:
├── In Combat: Full mechanics, regeneration disabled
├── Out of Combat: Rapid regeneration, build swapping
├── Downed: Reduced skills, can be revived
└── Dead: Requires resurrection or respawn
```

## B. Targeting System

```
TARGETING MODES

├── Cycles through enemies by distance
├── Priority: Aggro target > Nearest > Random
└── Maintains target through line-of-sight breaks

Ground Target: AoE skill placement
├── Max range indicated by circle
├── Skills fire at cursor position
└── Can be pre-cast for timing

Auto-Target: Some skills acquire targets
├── Nearest enemy for offensive
├── Lowest HP ally for healing
└── Can be overridden with manual target

Friendly Target: Support skills
├── Click to target ally
├── Self-target with key modifier

# III. ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM

## A. Primary Attributes

Each class has 4 attribute lines. Points are distributed from a pool of 200 (max 16 per attribute at level 20).

```
ATTRIBUTE SCALING

Points  | Bonus per Point | Cumulative at 16
--------|-----------------|------------------
0-8     | +5% per point   | +40% at rank 8
9-12    | +3% per point   | +52% at rank 12
13-16   | +2% per point   | +60% at rank 16

This creates diminishing returns, encouraging diverse builds.
```

## B. Universal Attributes

```
HEALTH: Base 480 + (20 × Level) + (Vitality × 20)
├── Level 20 base: 880 HP
├── Max with investment: 1,200 HP
└── Tank builds: 1,400-1,600 HP

ENERGY: Base 20 + (Primary Attribute × 1)
├── Standard pool: 30-40
├── High investment: 45-55
└── Caster builds: 50-60

ENERGY REGENERATION: 3 pips base (0.33 energy/second per pip)
├── 3 pips = 1 energy/second
├── 4 pips (with investment) = 1.33 energy/second
├── Skills can grant temporary bonus pips
└── Some builds trade regen for burst

ARMOR: Base 60 + (Level × 3) + Equipment
├── Level 20 base: 120
├── Heavy armor: 180-220
├── Light armor: 100-140
└── Damage Reduction = Armor / (Armor + 300)
```

---

# IV. DAMAGE CALCULATION

## A. Base Damage Formula

```
DAMAGE CALCULATION PIPELINE

Step 1: Base Damage
├── Weapon Damage: Listed on weapon (e.g., 15-28)
├── Skill Multiplier: % of weapon damage or flat
└── Attribute Scaling: +1% per attribute point in relevant line

Step 2: Offensive Modifiers (Multiplicative)
├── Critical Hit: 1.5x damage (base 4% chance)
├── Might/Damage Buffs: 1.25x per stack
├── Target Vulnerability: 1.25x per stack
└── Conditional Bonuses: Varies

Step 3: Defensive Mitigation (Sequential)
├── Armor Reduction: Damage × (300 / (300 + Armor))
├── Resistance Reduction: Damage × (100 / (100 + Resistance))
├── Protection/Damage Reduction: Damage × 0.75 per stack
└── Shields/Barriers: Absorb before HP

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
Skill Base: 50 damage
Attribute (12 ranks): 50 × 1.36 = 68
Might Buff: 68 × 1.25 = 85
Critical Hit: 85 × 1.5 = 127.5
Target Armor (150): 127.5 × (300/450) = 85
Target Protection: 85 × 0.75 = 63.75 final damage
```

## B. Attack Speed and DPS

```
DPS FORMULA

DPS = (Average Damage × Attack Speed × Hit Rate) + DoT DPS + Skill DPS

Attack Speed Modifiers:
├── Base: 1.0 attacks/second
├── Weapon Type: 0.75 - 1.5 modifier
├── Swiftness: +33% attack speed
├── Frenzy skills: +25-50% attack speed
└── Cap: 2.5 attacks/second (40% IAS max effective)

HIT RATE:
├── Base: 90% chance to hit
├── Blind: -90% accuracy (9% hit rate)
├── Cover: -20% to -50% accuracy
├── Evasion: Target dodge chance (5-25%)
└── Minimum: 5% hit rate (always some chance)
```

## C. Damage Type Interactions

```
ARMOR TYPE EFFECTIVENESS

              vs Kinetic | vs Energy | vs Exotic
--------------|-----------|-----------|----------
Power Armor   | +50%      | +25%      | +0%
Carapace      | +30%      | +15%      | +10%
Mesh/Light    | +10%      | +30%      | +25%
Energy Shield | +0%       | +40%      | -25%

├── Waypoint costs for repositioning
└── Ammunition is infinite (no resource)

CONSUMABLE BALANCE:
├── T1 Consumables: +15% combat effectiveness
├── T2 Consumables: +25% combat effectiveness
├── T3 Consumables: +35% combat effectiveness
├── T4 Consumables: +50% combat effectiveness
└── Designed to help, not be required for normal content
```

## B. Progression System Integration

```
COMBAT → PROGRESSION

Experience Gain:
├── Enemy kills grant XP based on tier

# XI. BALANCE NOTES AND KNOWN TUNING POINTS

## A. Priority Balance Issues (from Balance Analyzer)

```
P0 - CRITICAL (Must fix before launch):

1. Berserker Scaling
   Issue: Kill bonus damage uncapped, reaches +300% in sustained fights
   Fix: Cap at 30% max (+2.5% per point instead of +5%)
   
2. Infinite Smite Combo (Psyker)
   Issue: Warp Siphon + Power Conduit = unlimited energy
   Fix: 
   ├── Warp Siphon: 3 energy (was 10)
   ├── Power Conduit: 6 energy (was 15)
   └── Add 5s internal cooldown on Warp Siphon

3. Summon Stacking
   Issue: Multiple summoners = overwhelming numbers
   Fix: Party-wide summon cap of 6 entities
```

## B. Secondary Balance Issues

```
P1 - HIGH (Week 1 patch):

1. Necron Reanimation
   Issue: 120s cooldown too short for 100% HP restore
   Fix: 180s cooldown

2. Armor Cap Too High
   Issue: 150 armor = 50% DR, too effective
   Fix: Cap at 140 (47% max DR from armor alone)

3. Tyranid Synapse Stacking
   Issue: +15% per nearby Tyranid uncapped
   Fix: Cap at 2 stacks (+30% max)
```

## C. Underperforming Options

```
P2 - TUNING (Ongoing):

1. Cultist Class
   Issue: Low HP, low damage, no niche
   Fix: +20% HP, unique "Expendable" mechanic (bonus on death)

2. Imperial Guard Bayonet Skills
   Issue: Melee on ranged class with no support
   Fix: Rework to "Last Stand" defensive buff tree

3. Ork Ranged Builds
   Issue: High energy costs, low regen
   Fix: Ork energy pool 35 (was 25), add WAAAGH! Charge mechanic

4. Tau Melee Skills
   Issue: Trap options with no support
   Fix: Replace with Drone Command support skills
```

# XII. COMBAT SUMMARY

This combat system delivers the Guild Wars 1 promise:
- **Build Diversity:** 8-skill bars with meaningful choices
- **Energy Management:** Every skill matters, no spam
- **Horizontal Progression:** Skill > Gear level
- **Team Composition:** Party synergy without hard requirements
- **Faction Identity:** Each faction plays differently

The identified balance issues are **numerical, not structural**—the core design is sound and ready for implementation with the noted tuning adjustments.

---

*"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only WAR... and carefully balanced combat mechanics."*
