# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's combat system: **Build diversity over gear dependency, skill over stats, and tactical decisions over rotations.** Combat should reward preparation, positioning, and adaptation.

**Core Principles:**
- 8-skill bar creates meaningful pre-combat decisions
- No dedicated healer requirement (but healing builds viable)
- Every profession can contribute to every role
- Enemy mechanics require observation and response
- PvP and PvE use the same skills (balanced separately where needed)

# III. DAMAGE SYSTEM

## A. Damage Types

```
DAMAGE TYPE TAXONOMY

PHYSICAL DAMAGE
├── Kinetic: Standard ballistic weapons (bolters, lasguns)
│   └── Resisted by: Armor
├── Explosive: Grenades, missiles, plasma splash
│   └── Resisted by: Armor (reduced), affects area
├── Rending: Chainweapons, power weapons, claws
│   └── Armor Penetration: Ignores 25-75% armor
└── Impact: Hammers, vehicle collisions, crushing
    └── Knockdown chance, ignores 50% armor

ENERGY DAMAGE
├── Thermal: Flamers, meltas, plasma
│   └── Causes Burning condition, high damage
├── Electrical: Arc weapons, tesla, haywire
│   └── Causes Disruption (tech debuff), chains to nearby
├── Radiation: Rad weapons, exotic Tau systems
│   └── Causes Irradiated (stacking damage over time)
└── Warp: Psychic powers, daemon weapons
    └── Bypasses armor, resisted by Willpower

SPECIAL DAMAGE
├── Poison: Toxic ammunition, creature venoms
│   └── Damage over time, stacking intensity
├── Holy: Blessed weapons, faith powers
│   └── Bonus damage vs Chaos/Daemons
└── True Damage: Execution attacks, certain elites
    └── Ignores all resistances
```

## B. Damage Calculation Formula

```
DAMAGE FORMULA

Base Damage = Skill Base + (Attribute × Skill Coefficient)

Modified Damage = Base Damage 
                  × Weapon Modifier (0.8 - 1.2)
                  × Critical Modifier (if crit)
                  × Condition Modifiers

Final Damage = Modified Damage × (1 - Damage Reduction)

Where:
├── Damage Reduction = Armor / (Armor + 50) for physical
├── Damage Reduction = Willpower × 2% for Warp damage
└── Damage Reduction = Specific resistance for elemental

CRITICAL HITS:
├── Base crit chance: 5%
├── Critical multiplier: 1.5x (varies by weapon)
├── Some skills cannot crit
└── Some skills always crit under conditions
```

### Example Calculations

```
EXAMPLE 1: Lasgun Shot (T1 Imperial Weapon)

Skill Base: 15
Ballistic Skill: 10 (Attribute)
Coefficient: 0.8

Base Damage = 15 + (10 × 0.8) = 23
Weapon Modifier = 1.0 (standard)
No crit

Target Armor: 60
Damage Reduction = 60 / (60 + 50) = 54.5%

Final Damage = 23 × (1 - 0.545) = 10.5 → 10 damage

---

EXAMPLE 2: Power Sword Strike (T3 Melee Weapon)

Skill Base: 45
Weapon Skill: 14 (Attribute)
Coefficient: 1.2
Armor Penetration: 50%

Base Damage = 45 + (14 × 1.2) = 61.8
Critical Hit! × 1.5 = 92.7

Target Armor: 80
Effective Armor after Penetration: 40
Damage Reduction = 40 / (40 + 50) = 44.4%

Final Damage = 92.7 × (1 - 0.444) = 51.5 → 51 damage
```
