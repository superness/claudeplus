# 6. VERDICT

## Summary Assessment

| Category | Status | Issues Found |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Early Game (1-10) | ✓ BALANCED | Minor ranged TTK slow |
| Mid Game (11-20) | ✓ BALANCED | Smooth progression |
| End Game (20+) | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Exploit potential, class disparity |
| PvE Balance | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | 2 broken loops, 3 weak classes |
| PvP Balance | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Earth Caste unviable |
| Difficulty Scaling | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Hard/Legend damage too high |
| Faction Balance | ✓ BALANCED | Minor Ork healing gap |

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action:
1. **Crusader Zeal Self-Damage Loop** - GAME BREAKING
2. **Mont'ka Execution Chain Reset** - GAME BREAKING
3. **Ethereal Solo Viability** - UNPLAYABLE
4. **Earth Caste PvP** - NON-COMPETITIVE

## Overall System Health:
- **Core Combat Mechanics**: Excellent (Guild Wars 1 DNA intact)
- **Profession Diversity**: Good (13/15 viable, 2 need work)
- **Build Variety**: Good (skill bar system works well)
- **Faction Identity**: Excellent (unique mechanics preserved)
- **Time-to-Kill Targets**: Met within tolerance

# FINAL VERDICT: **NEEDS_TUNING**

The combat system foundation is solid and achieves the Guild Wars 1 feel. However, **4 critical issues** must be addressed before release:

1. Two infinite loops (Zeal + Mont'ka) that trivialize content
2. Two professions (Ethereal, Earth Caste) with unacceptable viability gaps
3. Difficulty mode damage scaling creates unfair death spirals
4. WAAAGH! stacking enables burst that bypasses intended TTK

With the recommended number changes implemented, this system would rate **BALANCED**. The design team should implement Critical and High priority fixes, then conduct targeted playtesting before final sign-off.
