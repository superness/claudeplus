### Summary Scorecard

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| New Player Experience | ✅ 9/10 | Smooth, rewarding, no gates |
| Mid-Game Balance | ⚠️ 7/10 | Savings rate slightly high |
| Endgame Sustainability | ⚠️ 6/10 | Needs more sinks, inflation risk |
| Exploit Prevention | ✅ 8/10 | Well-designed, minor gaps |
| Cross-System Integration | ✅ 8/10 | Combat/economy well-linked |
| Currency Diversity | ✅ 9/10 | Faction currencies add depth |

### Critical Issues Count
- **Blocking Issues:** 0
- **Major Issues:** 2 (savings rate, endgame sinks)
- **Minor Issues:** 4 (alt farming, vendor arbitrage clarity, Teef decay, travel scaling)

### Verdict Rationale
The economy is fundamentally sound and follows Guild Wars 1 principles well. The 72% sink target is intelligent, and the multi-currency system creates meaningful faction engagement. However, the endgame sink calculation doesn't account for wealth accumulation properly - players will accumulate faster than designed, leading to inflation within 6-12 months of launch.

**With the recommended high-priority fixes applied, this economy will be healthy.**

**VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING**

The economy design is strong but requires adjustments to endgame gold sinks (repair cap, progressive AH fees, account-wide daily caps) to prevent long-term inflation. No blocking exploits found.
