```

## B. Mid-Game Player Simulation (50-100 Hours)

```
WEEKLY ECONOMIC CYCLE (10h/week player at hour 75)

Starting Position:
├── Current gold: ~35,000g
├── Gear: Full T3, 2× T4 pieces
├── Reputation: Honored with 2 factions
└── AH activity: Regular buyer/seller

Weekly Income:
├── Quests (story + side): ~3,500g
├── Daily bounties (×7 days): ~1,200g
├── Weekly challenges: ~800g
├── Enemy drops: ~2,000g
├── AH sales (materials): ~1,500g
├── AH sales (T2 drops): ~800g
└── Total weekly income: ~9,800g

Weekly Expenses:
├── Travel: ~700g (frequent zone changes)
├── Repairs: ~1,200g (T3 gear, some deaths)
├── Consumables: ~800g (raiding preparation)
├── AH fees: ~300g (on 2,300g in sales)
├── Crafting fees: ~600g (working on T4)
├── Faction donations: ~400g (weekly cap)
├── First prestige purchase: 15,000g (skill effect) [ONE TIME]
└── Total weekly expenses: ~4,000g (recurring) + 15,000g (one-time)

Net Weekly Position:
├── Recurring net: +5,800g/week
├── After prestige purchase: -9,200g (one week)
├── Recovery time: ~1.5 weeks to break even
├── On track for: Full T4 by week 12-14
└── Status: HEALTHY - Steady progression

VERDICT: Mid-game feels rewarding. Players can afford one 
major prestige item every 2-3 weeks while still progressing 
on gear. The 15,000g entry point for prestige is achievable.
```

## C. Endgame Player Simulation (200+ Hours)

```
WEEKLY ECONOMIC CYCLE (Veteran at hour 250)

Starting Position:
├── Current gold: ~180,000g
├── Gear: Full T4, 3× T5 pieces, 1× Legendary
├── Reputation: Exalted with all factions
├── AH activity: Major market participant
└── Guild: Officer in active guild

Weekly Income:
├── Elite content: ~4,500g
├── Daily bounties (×7): ~1,200g
├── Weekly challenges (all): ~1,600g
├── Enemy drops: ~1,200g (hitting soft cap often)
├── AH sales (T4-T5 materials): ~5,000g
├── AH arbitrage (regional price differences): ~2,000g
└── Total weekly income: ~15,500g

Weekly Expenses:
├── Travel: ~1,000g (extensive zone hopping)
├── Repairs: ~2,500g (T4-T5 gear, challenging content)
├── Consumables: ~1,800g (elite raid preparation)
├── AH fees: ~700g (on 7,000g in sales)
├── Crafting fees: ~1,500g (T5 projects)
├── Faction donations: ~800g (maxed weekly)
├── Guild contribution: ~2,000g
├── Prestige purchases: ~5,000g/week average
└── Total weekly expenses: ~15,300g

Net Weekly Position:
├── Net gain: +200g/week (near equilibrium)
├── Big purchases: Saving for legendary (~40,000g)
├── Time to legendary: ~3-4 months of dedicated saving
└── Status: SLIGHT CONCERN - May feel "stuck"

ANALYSIS:
At endgame, the sink rate is achieving the target 75-80% 
range. However, the near-equilibrium state may feel 
unsatisfying. The path to legendary gear (40,000g average) 
requires 200+ weeks at current rates without reducing 
prestige spending.
```

# II. EXPLOITS FOUND

## A. Identified Exploits

```
EXPLOIT #1: REGIONAL ARBITRAGE LOOP
Status: MINOR CONCERN

Mechanism:
├── Industrial zones: Metals -15%
├── Agricultural zones: Organics -20%
├── Cross-region fee: +15%
├── Net profit potential: 5% on organics, 0% on metals
└── With reputation discount (20%): Up to 10% profit margin

Analysis:
├── 10% margin seems reasonable for effort
├── Travel time creates natural throttle
├── Volume limits (T3-T5) prevent mass exploitation
└── VERDICT: Working as intended (regional trade encouraged)

---

EXPLOIT #2: DAILY RESET TIMING ABUSE
Status: FIXED BY DESIGN

Mechanism:
├── Daily reset at 00:00 server time
├── Players could farm to soft cap, wait, farm again
├── Getting ~17,000g in 2 hours spanning reset
└── This is expected behavior for dedicated players

Analysis:
├── Soft cap (not hard cap) limits effectiveness
├── 50% reduction after cap still discourages this
├── Post-cap conversion to faction currency helps
└── VERDICT: Acceptable - players who put in time earn more

---

EXPLOIT #3: CRAFT MATERIAL STOCKPILING
Status: POTENTIAL CONCERN

Mechanism:
├── T1-T2 materials have no daily trade limit
├── No decay on materials
├── Players could stockpile indefinitely
├── Corner the market during off-peak times
└── Sell at inflated prices during events

Analysis:
├── Storage limits (stash tabs cost gold) provide soft cap
├── Opportunity cost of gold tied up in materials
├── But large guilds could coordinate stockpiles
└── VERDICT: NEEDS MONITORING - Add storage decay for T1-T2?

RECOMMENDATION: Consider 2% weekly decay on T1-T2 materials 
in guild banks (personal storage exempt) to prevent guild-
level market manipulation.

---

EXPLOIT #4: ALT-ACCOUNT GOLD FUNNELING
Status: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

Current Protections:
├── Same-IP accounts share daily caps
├── New account restrictions (14 days)
├── Transaction monitoring

Remaining Vulnerability:
├── VPN users can bypass IP detection
├── After 14 days, alts have full access
├── Each alt generates ~8,500g/day potential
├── 5 alts = 42,500g/day theoretical maximum

Analysis:
├── Requires significant time investment per alt
├── Transaction patterns would flag suspicious activity
├── Not economically efficient vs. playing main
└── VERDICT: ACCEPTABLE RISK - monitoring catches abuse

---

EXPLOIT #5: EVENT ITEM FRONT-RUNNING
Status: FIXED

Original Issue:
├── Players could stockpile event items
├── Sell immediately at high prices to eager buyers
└── First movers gain massive advantage

Fix Applied:
├── 30-day account-bind on event items
├── Market stabilizes before items become tradeable
└── VERDICT: RESOLVED
```

## B. Potential Future Exploits

```
WATCH LIST

1. Guild Bank Cycling
├── Large guilds rotate items through bank
├── Circumvent personal trade limits
├── RECOMMENDATION: Per-account guild withdrawal caps

2. Cross-Faction Information Arbitrage
├── Players on both Imperial and Tau
├── See prices on both markets
├── Execute cross-faction trades via neutral hub
├── VERDICT: Working as intended (encourages spies/merchants)

3. Repair Cost Avoidance
├── Players unequip gear before death
├── Zero repair costs
├── RECOMMENDATION: Unequipping in combat = 50% durability loss

4. Crafting Critical Success Farming
├── 5% "lucky" crafts for Orks
├── Spam cheap items for superior outcomes
├── RECOMMENDATION: Lucky proc rate scales with item tier
   ├── T1: 1% lucky chance
   ├── T2: 2% lucky chance
   ├── T3: 3% lucky chance
   ├── T4-T5: 5% lucky chance
```

# III. BALANCE ISSUES

## A. Prices Too High

```
ISSUE #1: T5 SET AFFORDABILITY
Severity: MODERATE

Current State:
├── T5 set cost: 64,000-120,000g
├── Endgame weekly net: +200g (at equilibrium)
├── Time to T5 set: 320-600 weeks (6-12 YEARS)
└── This is clearly too long

Root Cause:
├── Endgame sinks too aggressive
├── Prestige spending competes with progression
├── No meaningful gold increase from T4→T5 content

RECOMMENDATION:
├── T5 content should provide +50% gold rewards
├── OR reduce T5 prices by 30% (45,000-84,000g range)
├── OR introduce T5 material trading (currently capped at 20/day)
└── Preferred: Increase T5 content rewards

---

ISSUE #2: LEGENDARY ACQUISITION TIME
Severity: HIGH

Current State:
├── Legendary cost: 25,000-60,000g (40,000g average)
├── Full legendary set (8 pieces): 200,000-480,000g
├── Time to full legendary: Essentially impossible
└── Only market flippers could achieve this

Analysis:
├── Legendaries should be rare but achievable
├── Current design makes them unattainable for most
├── Creates frustration, not aspiration

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Legendaries should be primarily CRAFTED, not bought
├── Crafting cost: 15,000g + rare materials (from raids)
├── Market prices will settle based on material availability
├── Goal: 1 legendary per month for dedicated endgame player
└── Full set achievable in 8-12 months (reasonable)
```

## B. Prices Too Low

```
ISSUE #1: T1-T2 VENDOR PRICES
Severity: MINOR

Current State:
├── T1 vendor buy: 50g, T1 market: 20-40g
├── T2 vendor buy: 200g, T2 market: 80-160g
├── Vendors are consistently 25-50% more expensive
└── Nobody buys T1-T2 from vendors

Analysis:
├── This is actually fine - drives AH engagement
├── Vendor prices serve as price ceiling
├── New players learn to use AH for better deals
└── VERDICT: WORKING AS INTENDED

---

ISSUE #2: CONSUMABLE PRICING
Severity: MODERATE

Current State:
├── T3 consumable vendor: 300g
├── T3 consumable market: 150-250g
├── Consumables too cheap relative to impact
└── Players can "over-buff" without meaningful cost

Analysis:
├── If T3 buff lasts 30 minutes and costs 200g
├── Player earns ~500g in 30 minutes of play
├── Buff cost = 40% of period income (reasonable)
├── But multiple buffs = 120-160% of income (unsustainable)

RECOMMENDATION:
├── Limit concurrent buffs to 3 (already common design)
├── OR increase consumable prices by 20%
├── T3 consumables: 180-300g market range
└── Creates meaningful choice in buff selection
```

## C. Rewards Too Generous/Stingy

```
REWARDS TOO GENEROUS:

1. Daily Bounties Early Game
├── 75-150g/day from bounties alone
├── Hour 1-10 player earns ~250g/hour
├── Bounties = 30-60 minutes equivalent
├── VERDICT: Slightly generous, but acceptable for retention

2. First-Time Completion Bonus (+50%)
├── Incentivizes exploration (good)
├── But creates feast/famine cycle
├── New zones = flush with gold
├── Farmed zones = gold-starved
├── RECOMMENDATION: Reduce to +25%, add repeatable bonuses

---

REWARDS TOO STINGY:

1. Endgame Enemy Drops
├── Bosses drop 100-200g
├── But require 30-60 minutes to reach
├── Effective rate: 3-7g/minute from boss
├── Basic enemies: 5-60g = 10-30g/minute average
├── BOSSES SHOULD DROP MORE THAN TRASH
├── RECOMMENDATION: Boss drops = 300-600g

2. Weekly Challenges at Endgame
├── 200-400g per weekly
├── ~1,600g/week from all weeklies
├── Trivial for endgame gear levels
├── RECOMMENDATION: Weekly challenges should scale with level
│   ├── Low level: 200-400g
│   ├── Mid level: 400-800g
│   └── Endgame: 800-1,600g
```

# VII. FINAL VERDICT

## Summary Assessment

| Category | Rating | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| New Player Experience | ✅ EXCELLENT | Well-paced, achievable milestones |
| Mid-Game Economy | ✅ GOOD | Engaging, meaningful choices |
| Endgame Economy | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | T5/Legendary acquisition too slow |
| Exploit Prevention | ✅ GOOD | Major exploits addressed |
| Sink Balance | ⚠️ NEEDS TUNING | Endgame sinks slightly too aggressive |
| Market Design | ✅ EXCELLENT | GW1-style works well |
| Faction Economies | ✅ EXCELLENT | Flavorful and functional |
| Inflation Control | ✅ GOOD | Systems in place, need monitoring |

## Required Changes Before Launch

1. **T5/Legendary Acquisition** - Current design makes them nearly impossible
2. **Boss Reward Scaling** - Bosses must be worth killing economically  
3. **Weekly Challenge Scaling** - Maintain relevance at all levels
4. **PvP Economic Integration** - Currently undefined
5. **Crafter Income Path** - Add crafting commission system

## Recommended (Not Critical)

1. Catch-up mechanics for returning players
2. T1-T2 material decay in guild banks
3. Combat unequip penalty
4. First-time bonus reduction (50% → 25%)
5. Endgame soft cap increase

---

## VERDICT: **NEEDS_TUNING**

The economy design is fundamentally sound and follows proven GW1 principles effectively. The faction-specific economies are creative and well-balanced. New and mid-game player experiences are excellent.

However, the endgame economy has significant issues:
- T5/Legendary gear is essentially unattainable through normal play
- Boss rewards don't scale with difficulty
- Endgame players hit near-zero net gain too quickly

These issues will cause endgame player frustration and retention problems within 3-6 months of launch. The fixes are straightforward (reward scaling, crafting-based legendaries) and don't require fundamental redesign.

**Recommendation**: Implement the 5 required changes, re-simulate endgame scenarios, then proceed to approval.

DECISION: needs_tuning
