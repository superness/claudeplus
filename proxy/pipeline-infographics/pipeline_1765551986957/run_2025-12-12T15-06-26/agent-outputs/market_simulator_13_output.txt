### **VERDICT: NEEDS_TUNING**

**Summary:**
The economy design is fundamentally sound with strong foundations following Guild Wars 1 philosophy. New player and mid-game experiences are well-paced. However, several issues prevent approval:

1. **Two exploits require immediate fixes** (Reserved AH for RMT, Price Floor manipulation)
2. **Endgame sink rate 18-22% over target** causing gold starvation
3. **Ork faction suffers 48-51% currency disadvantage** creating faction imbalance
4. **Multi-account arbitrage vulnerability** exists in mail system

**What Works Well:**
- No infinite loops detected
- New player onboarding (Hours 0-20) excellent
- AH fee structure creates appropriate friction
- Regional price variance adds strategic depth
- Consumable economy self-sustaining in Nightmare

**Required Before Approval:**
1. Close Reserved AH listing exploit
2. Fix Emergency Price Floor manipulation
3. Reduce endgame sink rate to 65-70% range
4. Improve Ork cross-faction currency parity
5. Add new account mail restrictions

**Estimated Tuning Effort:** 8-12 specific number adjustments + 2 feature changes
