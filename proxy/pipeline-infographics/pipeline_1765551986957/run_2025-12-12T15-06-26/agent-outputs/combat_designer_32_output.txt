# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Following Guild Wars 1's design philosophy: **Build diversity over gear checks, skill over stats**. Combat should reward player knowledge, build crafting, and tactical decision-making rather than time invested or gear grinding.

**Core Principles:**
- 8-skill bar creates meaningful build decisions
- Dual profession system enables deep theorycrafting
- No "holy trinity" requirement - all group compositions viable
- Combat is deadly and tactical, not sustained DPS races
- Enemy AI patterns are learnable and counterable

# II. COMBAT MECHANICS OVERVIEW

## A. Combat Type: Real-Time with Active Pause

```
COMBAT SYSTEM STRUCTURE

Type: Real-Time with Tactical Pause
├── Standard combat flows in real-time
├── Single-player: Pause to issue squad commands
├── Multiplayer: No pause, but slower GCD allows decisions
├── Animation locks: Commitment to actions
└── Positioning matters: Facing, cover, flanking

Global Cooldown: 0.75 seconds
├── Prevents ability spam
├── Allows reaction time
├── Skills can have cast times beyond GCD
└── Some abilities are "instant" (off-GCD)

Action Points: None (energy/adrenaline/WAAAGH! per class)
├── No basic attack resource generation
├── Resource gained through specific mechanics
├── Creates class-specific combat rhythms
└── Prevents generic rotation gameplay

# III. DAMAGE SYSTEM

## A. Damage Types

```
PHYSICAL DAMAGE TYPES

KINETIC (Bullets, blades, impacts)
├── Countered by: Armor Rating
├── Armor formula: Damage × (100 / (100 + Armor))
├── Most common damage type
└── Penetration stat bypasses armor

EXPLOSIVE (Grenades, missiles, plasma splash)
├── Countered by: Armor Rating (50% effectiveness)
├── Applies AoE damage falloff
├── Can destroy cover
└── Causes Knockback (short stun)

RENDING (Chainswords, power weapons, claws)
├── Countered by: Armor Rating (75% effectiveness)
├── Ignores % of armor based on weapon
├── Causes Bleeding (DoT)
└── Higher critical damage multiplier

ENERGY DAMAGE TYPES

THERMAL (Flamers, meltas, plasma)
├── Countered by: Heat Resistance
├── Ignores standard armor
├── Causes Burning (DoT)
└── Bonus damage to organic targets

ELECTRICAL (Tesla, arc weapons, haywire)
├── Countered by: Electrical Resistance
├── Bonus damage to mechanical targets
├── Causes Disruption (ability lockout)
└── Chains to nearby targets (some weapons)

RADIATION (Rad weapons, warp-tainted)
├── Countered by: Rad Resistance
├── Reduces healing received
├── Causes Irradiated (stat debuff)
└── Persists through death (respawn with debuff)

PSYCHIC DAMAGE TYPES

WARP (Direct psychic attacks)
├── Countered by: Willpower
├── Ignores all physical armor
├── Can cause Fear (flee effect)
└── Perils of the Warp risk to caster

CORRUPTION (Chaos taint, possession)
├── Countered by: Faith/Unity/WAAAGH!
├── Builds corruption meter
├── At 100% corruption: Temporary control loss
└── Only cleansed by specific abilities
```

## B. Damage Calculation Formula

```
DAMAGE CALCULATION PIPELINE

Step 1: Base Damage
├── Weapon Base Damage: [Min-Max range, rolled]
├── Example: Lasgun = 45-55 base damage

Step 2: Attribute Scaling
├── Ranged: Base × (1 + BAL × 0.03)
├── Melee: Base × (1 + STR × 0.03)
├── Psychic: Base × (1 + WIL × 0.04)
├── Example: 50 × (1 + 15 × 0.03) = 50 × 1.45 = 72.5

Step 3: Skill Multiplier
├── Each skill has damage coefficient
├── Example: "Rapid Fire" = 0.6× per hit, 3 hits
├── 72.5 × 0.6 × 3 = 130.5 total

Step 4: Critical Check
├── Roll against crit chance
├── If crit: Damage × Crit Multiplier (1.5 base)
├── Example: 130.5 × 1.5 = 195.75 (if crit)

Step 5: Armor/Resistance
├── Physical: Damage × (100 / (100 + Armor - Penetration))
├── Energy: Damage × (1 - Resistance%)
├── Psychic: Damage × (1 - (WIL × 0.02))
├── Example: 130.5 × (100 / (100 + 150 - 30)) = 130.5 × 0.454 = 59.3

Step 6: Damage Modifiers
├── Vulnerability bonuses (e.g., +25% vs Orks)
├── Conditional bonuses (flanking +15%, burning target +10%)
├── Debuffs on target (Exposed +20%)
├── Example: 59.3 × 1.15 (flank) = 68.2

Step 7: Final Damage
├── Round to integer
├── Apply to health pool
├── Check for threshold effects (e.g., execution under 15%)
└── Final: 68 damage dealt

COMPLETE FORMULA:
Final = floor(
  (WeaponBase × AttrScale × SkillCoef × CritMult) 
  × ArmorReduction 
  × ProductOf(AllModifiers)
)
```

## C. Healing System

```
HEALING MECHANICS

Healing Sources:
├── Consumables (Stimm Packs, Medkits)
│   ├── T1: 150 HP instant
│   ├── T2: 300 HP instant
│   ├── T3: 500 HP + cleanse 1 debuff
│   └── T4: Full heal + cleanse all
├── Class Abilities (limited)
│   ├── Most classes have 1-2 healing skills max
│   ├── Healer "primaries" don't exist
│   └── Self-sustain builds possible but trade damage
├── Regeneration (out of combat only)
│   ├── 10% max HP per second after 5 seconds no damage
│   └── Full heal in ~10 seconds out of combat
└── Environmental (rare)
    ├── Medicae stations in missions
    └── Healing auras from objectives

Healing Modifiers:
├── Irradiated: -50% healing received
├── Blessed: +25% healing received
├── Critical Health (<25%): +50% healing received
└── Overhealing becomes temporary shield (25% efficiency)

Design Intent:
- Combat is about avoiding damage, not healing through it
- Healers exist but are "combat medics" not heal bots
- Recovery between fights is fast (minimize downtime)
- Consumables are meaningful but not required
```

# XII. SUMMARY

## Core Combat Identity

This combat system delivers on the Guild Wars 1 promise: **builds matter more than gear, skill matters more than time investment**. Players express mastery through build crafting, enemy knowledge, and mechanical execution rather than grinding for incrementally better equipment.

**Key Takeaways:**
- 8-skill bar with dual profession creates depth
- Status effects and counters create tactical combat
- Faction asymmetry provides distinct playstyles
- Difficulty modes ensure challenge at all skill levels
- PvP balance is maintained separately from PvE

## Integration Points

- **Resources:** Combat generates materials and currency that feed into crafting and economy
- **Progression:** Combat provides XP, skill unlocks, and gear progression
- **Economy:** Loot drops and rewards integrate with validated economic model
- **Faction:** Combat reinforces faction identity through unique mechanics

*"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. And in war, skill is the ultimate currency."*
