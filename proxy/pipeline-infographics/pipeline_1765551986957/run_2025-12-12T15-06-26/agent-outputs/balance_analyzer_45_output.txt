║   The combat system has solid foundations but contains:      ║
║   - 4 critical exploits requiring immediate fixes            ║
║   - Significant melee vs ranged imbalance                    ║
║   - Multiple trap options reducing build diversity           ║
║   - Energy economy exploits enabling infinite loops          ║

║   With recommended changes, system achieves balance.         ║
║   Core design is SOUND - issues are numerical, not           ║

### Economic Note

**Potential Conflict Identified:**
- Combat drops create primary income source (5-500 Thrones per kill)
- Overpowered builds farm 2-3x faster = 2-3x income
- If not fixed, economy inflates around broken builds
- Mekboy "Loot!" skill can be exploited for +25% materials

**Recommendation:** Fix combat balance BEFORE finalizing economy numbers, or economy will be balanced around broken builds.
