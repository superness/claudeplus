# Economic Simulation Analysis: Warhammer 40K MMO (Guild Wars 1 Style)

## Executive Summary

I've analyzed the proposed economy design through extensive simulation modeling. The system shows solid fundamentals but has several concerning issues that need addressing before launch.

---

## 1. SIMULATION RESULTS

### New Player (0-10 Hours, Levels 1-15)

```
INCOME SIMULATION: NEW PLAYER

Hour 1-2: Tutorial Zone
├── Quests completed: 8-10
├── Gold earned: ~200g (tutorial rewards)
├── Enemies killed: ~50 T1 trash
├── Enemy drops: ~400g (50 × 8g avg)
├── Materials gathered: 30 T1, 5 T2
├── TOTAL: ~600g

Hour 3-10: First Zone Progression
├── Quests completed: 25-30
├── Quest gold: ~1,500g (50g avg)
├── Enemies killed: ~400 T1-T2 mix
├── Enemy drops: ~4,800g
├── Vendored loot: ~800g
├── Materials: 200 T1, 40 T2
├── TOTAL: ~7,100g

EXPENSES (10 hours):
├── Skill unlocks: 5 × 100g = 500g
├── Repairs: ~200g (low death rate)
├── Consumables: ~300g
├── Travel: ~100g
├── T1 gear upgrades: ~800g
├── TOTAL: ~1,900g

NET POSITION @ 10hrs: ~5,800g
T1→T2 TRANSITION COST: 2,200g
STATUS: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Player has buffer
```

**Finding:** New player experience is smooth. They can transition to T2 with ~3,600g buffer for emergencies or early AH purchases.

### Mid-Game Player (50-100 Hours, Levels 35-55)

```
INCOME SIMULATION: MID-GAME PLAYER (WEEKLY)

Activity Breakdown:
├── Daily quests (7 days): ~7,000g
├── Zone quests: ~4,000g
├── Enemy farming (T2-T3): ~12,000g
├── Boss kills (3-4/week): ~8,000g
├── Weekly challenges: ~3,000g
├── AH material sales: ~5,000g
├── TOTAL INCOME: ~39,000g/week

EXPENSES (Weekly):
├── AH fees (12,480g sold): ~1,248g
├── Repairs: ~1,500g
├── Consumables: ~2,000g
├── Skill unlocks: ~1,000g
├── Travel: ~500g
├── Prestige (optional): ~2,000g
├── TOTAL EXPENSES: ~8,248g

NET WEEKLY: ~30,752g

TIME TO T3→T4 TRANSITION:
├── Cost: 46,000g
├── Weeks needed: 1.5 weeks
├── Hours in that window: ~15-20 hours gameplay
└── STATUS: ✅ REASONABLE PACING
```

**Finding:** Mid-game feels rewarding. Players accumulate meaningful wealth while still having goals.

### Endgame Player (200+ Hours, Level 75+)

```
INCOME SIMULATION: ENDGAME PLAYER (WEEKLY)

Activity Breakdown:
├── Daily quests (7 days): ~10,500g (scaling)

└── STATUS: ⚠️ CONCERN - See Analysis
```

## 2. EXPLOITS FOUND

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Material Tier Arbitrage Loop

```
EXPLOIT: CROSS-TIER MATERIAL CONVERSION

Current System:
├── T1 enemies drop T1 (60%) and T2 (15%) materials
├── T2 enemies drop T1 (50%) and T2 (25%) materials
├── If crafting allows: 5 T1 → 1 T2 conversion

EXPLOIT PATH:
1. Farm T1 trash (fastest kill rate)
2. Convert T1 materials to T2
3. If T2→T3 conversion exists, continue
4. Sell converted materials at higher tier prices

PROBLEM: T1 farming becomes most efficient
├── T1 kill rate: 30/minute possible
├── T1 drop rate: 60% = 18 T1 mats/min
├── If conversion ratio is 5:1 = 3.6 T2 mats/min
├── Direct T2 farming: ~15/min × 25% = 3.75 T2/min
└── Nearly equivalent, but T1 is FAR easier

SEVERITY: 🔴 HIGH
Trivializes T2-T3 content if ratios aren't controlled
```

**Fix Required:** Material conversion should be 8:1 or 10:1, not 5:1, or conversion should require rare catalyst items.

### 🟡 MODERATE: Boss Instance Reset Farming

```
EXPLOIT: RAPID BOSS RE-KILLING

If instances reset on re-entry:
├── Kill boss → Exit → Re-enter → Repeat
├── Boss average: 75g + guaranteed mats
├── If 10-minute boss kill cycle possible
├── 6 bosses/hour × 75g = 450g/hour PLUS mats

vs Normal farming: ~200g/hour at equivalent tier

SEVERITY: 🟡 MODERATE
Not game-breaking but creates "optimal" boring gameplay
```

**Fix Required:** Instance lockouts (daily/weekly) OR diminishing returns on repeated kills within 24h window.

### 🟡 MODERATE: AH Fee Manipulation

```
EXPLOIT: GUILD TRADING TO AVOID FEES

Current: 10% AH fees
Guild benefit: Reduced/waived fees?

If guild trades are fee-free:
├── Create "trading guilds"
├── Use guild bank as fee-free exchange
├── Dodge 10% on all transactions
├── Massive advantage over solo players

SEVERITY: 🟡 MODERATE (if guild trading is fee-free)
```

**Fix Required:** Guild trades should have 3-5% fee, or guild trading requires guild level investment.

### 🟢 MINOR: New Account Material Farming

```
EXPLOIT: MULE ARMY

If no account restrictions:
├── Create 10 free accounts
├── Complete tutorial on each (200g + mats)
├── Transfer to main account
├── Delete, repeat

BLOCKED BY: Document mentions "account restrictions"
Verify: Transfer cooldowns, new account trade limits
```

---

## 3. BALANCE ISSUES

### ⚠️ T5/Legendary Time Gate Too Harsh

```
ANALYSIS: ENDGAME PROGRESSION WALL

Current Design:
├── 335,000g required (achievable in 4.6 weeks)
├── PLUS time-gated materials: 4-6 weeks PER PIECE
├── 8 pieces × 5 weeks average = 40 WEEKS

Problem:
├── Gold accumulation outpaces time gates
├── Players sit on 500k+ gold with nothing to spend on
├── Creates "dead money" syndrome
├── Player frustration: "I have the gold, just let me buy it!"

Comparison to GW1:
├── FoW/UW armor was expensive but NOT time-gated
├── Elite skill captures were time-consuming but PARALLELIZABLE
└── Multiple goals could be pursued simultaneously
```

**Recommendation:** Reduce time gate to 2-3 weeks per piece OR allow gold to bypass time gates at premium rate (double material cost).

### ⚠️ Prestige Pricing Creates Dead Zone

```
ANALYSIS: PRESTIGE PURCHASE TIMING

Level 50-55 (T3→T4):
├── "Optional" prestige: 15,000g
├── Required gear: 25,000g
├── Total available at transition: ~46,000g
├── If player buys prestige: Delays gear 1+ weeks

Level 70-75 (T4→T5):
├── "Expected" prestige: 40,000g
├── Required gear: 80,000g
├── Player likely has: ~80,000g at transition
├── Cannot afford both without extra farming

PROBLEM: Prestige labeled "optional/expected" but economically punishing
```

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Label prestige honestly as "post-gear luxury"
2. OR reduce prestige costs by 40%
3. OR tie some prestige to achievements rather than gold

### ⚠️ Repair Costs Scale Too Aggressively

```
ANALYSIS: REPAIR COST PROGRESSION

Tier | Repair Cost (Full Death) | Kill Income Needed
-----|--------------------------|-------------------
T1   | ~50g                     | 5 kills
T2   | ~150g                    | 8 kills
T3   | ~400g                    | 12 kills
T4   | ~1,000g                  | 18 kills
T5   | ~2,500g                  | 28 kills

T5 PROBLEM:
├── Raid wipes can cost 10,000g+ in repairs
├── Learning new content becomes VERY expensive
├── Discourages experimentation
├── Punishes support roles who die helping team
```

**Recommendation:** Cap repair costs at 1,500g per full repair OR implement "learning mode" with reduced repair costs for first week of new content.

### ⚠️ Weekly Challenge Scaling Unclear

```
CONCERN: CHALLENGE REWARD SCALING

Document states "Weekly challenge scaling" as simulation fix
But no specific numbers provided.

If challenges don't scale with player level:
├── L75 player doing "kill 100 enemies" for 1,000g
├── That's 30 minutes of work for negligible reward
├── Players will ignore challenges entirely

If challenges DO scale:
├── Need specific numbers
├── Should represent 5-10% of weekly income at all tiers
```

**Recommendation:** Confirm challenge rewards:
- T1-2 players: 500-1,500g/week from challenges
- T3-4 players: 2,000-5,000g/week
- T5+ players: 8,000-15,000g/week

---

## 4. BALANCE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Specific Number Adjustments

```
RECOMMENDED CHANGES

1. MATERIAL CONVERSION RATES
   Current: Unknown (likely 5:1)
   Recommended: 10:1 base, 8:1 with crafting skill
   Reason: Prevents T1 farming dominance

2. BOSS LOCKOUTS
   Add: 4-hour lockout per boss (account-wide)
   Or: Diminishing returns (50% → 25% → 10% on repeats)
   Reason: Prevents reset farming

3. TIME GATE REDUCTION
   Current: 4-6 weeks per legendary piece
   Recommended: 2-3 weeks per piece
   Reason: Prevents gold pile-up frustration

4. PRESTIGE COST REDUCTION
   T3 prestige: 15,000g → 10,000g
   T4 prestige: 40,000g → 25,000g
   T5 prestige: 200,000g → Keep (true aspirational)
   Reason: Makes prestige achievable alongside gear

5. REPAIR COST CAP
   Add: Maximum 1,500g per full repair
   Add: "Practice mode" for new raids (50% repair cost)
   Reason: Encourages content engagement

6. GUILD TRADE FEE
   Current: Unknown
   Recommended: 3% guild trade fee
   Reason: Prevents AH fee avoidance

7. AH FEE ADJUSTMENT
   Current: 10% flat
   Recommended: 8% base, 5% for orders filled >24h
   Reason: Encourages patient trading, adds depth
```

### Inflation Monitoring Thresholds

```
ALERT THRESHOLDS (Automated Monitoring)

GREEN (Healthy):
├── Average player wealth growing 2-4% weekly
├── AH prices stable within 10% month-over-month
├── Sink rate 68-78% of generation

YELLOW (Investigate):
├── Average wealth growing 5-7% weekly
├── AH prices rising 15-25% month-over-month
├── Sink rate below 65% or above 82%

RED (Immediate Action):
├── Wealth growing 8%+ weekly
├── AH prices rising 30%+ month-over-month
├── Sink rate below 60%
├── Any material/gold dupe discovered
```

---

## 5. CROSS-SYSTEM IMPACT ANALYSIS

```
COMBAT → ECONOMY → PROGRESSION FLOW

VALIDATED LOOPS:
✅ Kill enemies → Get gold → Buy gear → Kill harder enemies
✅ Kill bosses → Get materials → Craft items → Sell on AH → Buy different items
✅ Complete quests → Unlock zones → Access new economies → More opportunities
✅ PvP wins → Faction currency → Specialty items → Competitive advantage

BROKEN LOOPS:
❌ Endgame gold → Time gates → Waiting → Gold piles up → Nothing to buy
❌ Prestige desire → Can't afford alongside gear → Skip prestige → Feels bad
❌ Raid learning → Deaths → Massive repair bills → Stop trying

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMBAT TEAM:
1. Boss rewards should include 15-20% "repair offset" gold
2. Raid completion bonus should cover group repair costs
3. Support roles should have reduced repair costs (keeping team alive = value)
```

---

## 6. LONG-TERM SIMULATION (6-Month Projection)

```
ECONOMY HEALTH PROJECTION

Month 1: Launch
├── Gold entering economy: Massive (new players)
├── Gold leaving economy: Low (nothing expensive yet)
├── Net inflation: 15-20% (expected, acceptable)
├── Concern: Watch for exploits

Month 2-3: Stabilization
├── Sinks come online (AH fees, repairs, mounts)
├── Player distribution normalizes
├── Expected inflation: 5-8% monthly
├── Concern: T3-T4 bottleneck possible

Month 4-5: Endgame Population
├── First wave hits legendary grind
├── Gold accumulation accelerates (time gates)
├── Risk: Dead money problem
├── Action needed: Add more gold sinks or reduce time gates

Month 6: Established Economy
├── If fixes implemented: Stable, healthy economy
├── If not fixed: 40-60% inflation, new players priced out
├── AH dominated by wealthy veterans
├── Recommendation: Plan expansion gold sinks
```

---

## 7. GW1 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CHECK

```
GUILD WARS 1 ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES

✅ Horizontal progression (different builds, not strictly "better")
   Status: PARTIALLY MET - Tier system is vertical
   Concern: Ensure T5 isn't mandatory for all content

✅ Skill > Gear mentality
   Status: UNVERIFIED - Combat team responsibility
   Economy should NOT make gear mandatory

✅ Reasonable grind for cosmetics
   Status: AT RISK - 40-week legendary grind too long
   GW1 FoW armor: 2-4 weeks for dedicated players

✅ No mandatory subscription
   Status: ECONOMY SUPPORTS THIS
   Gold generation/sink balanced for free players

✅ Trading viable but not mandatory
   Status: MET - Can progress without AH
   AH provides advantages but isn't required
```

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

The economy design demonstrates strong fundamentals—the 72% sink rate and tiered progression are well-thought-out. However, the endgame creates a problematic "rich but waiting" state that will frustrate dedicated players. The material conversion system needs explicit rules to prevent T1 farming dominance.

**Before approval, combat design team should confirm:**
1. Boss lockout/reset mechanics
2. Material conversion ratios
3. Repair cost implementation
4. Support role death cost considerations
