# Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Economy Design Document
## Damocles Gulf Sector MMO (Guild Wars 1 Style)

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's economic principles: **trading should be convenient but not mandatory, wealth should enable options rather than gate content, and the economy should serve gameplay rather than dominate it.**

**Core Principles:**
- No Pay-to-Win: Gold advantages are convenience, not power
- Multiple Paths: Every item acquirable through play, trade, OR crafting
- Regional Flavor: Faction economies feel distinct but interconnected
- Controlled Inflation: Robust sinks prevent runaway prices
- Player Agency: Trading is rewarding but never required

# IV. AUCTION HOUSE SYSTEM

## A. Core Mechanics

```
AUCTION HOUSE STRUCTURE

Access Points:
├── Major cities (dedicated AH building)
├── Outpost terminals (limited - browse only, no posting)
├── Personal interface (premium convenience item - NOT P2W, gold purchasable)

LISTING TYPES:

1. Buy Order (You want to buy):
├── Set price you're willing to pay
├── Set quantity desired
├── Duration: 24h / 72h / 7 days
├── Partial fills allowed
├── Auto-purchase when seller matches

2. Sell Order (You want to sell):
├── Set price you want
├── List item(s)
├── Duration: 24h / 72h / 7 days
├── Partial sales allowed (for stacks)
├── Item held in escrow during listing

3. Instant Buy/Sell:
├── Buy at lowest current sell price
├── Sell at highest current buy price
├── Immediate transaction
├── Higher effective fee (worse price)
```

## B. Fee Structure

```
AUCTION HOUSE FEES

LISTING FEE (Paid upfront, non-refundable):
├── 24-hour listing: 1% of asking price
├── 72-hour listing: 2% of asking price
├── 7-day listing: 3% of asking price
├── Minimum fee: 5T

TRANSACTION FEE (Paid on successful sale):
├── Standard rate: 8%
├── Patient seller bonus: 5% if order >24h old when filled
├── Guild discount: 6% for guild members (NOT fee-free)
├── Minimum fee: 10T

EXAMPLES:
Selling T3 material for 150T (72-hour listing):
├── Listing fee: 3T (2% of 150)
├── Transaction fee: 12T (8% of 150)
├── Total fees: 15T
├── Net received: 135T

If filled after 24+ hours:
├── Transaction fee: 7.5T (5% patient bonus)
├── Total fees: 10.5T
├── Net received: 139.5T → 139T (rounded)
```

## C. Trade Restrictions

```
ANTI-EXPLOIT MEASURES

ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS:
├── New accounts: 48-hour trade delay
├── First week: 5,000T daily AH limit
├── First month: 50,000T daily AH limit
├── Thereafter: 500,000T daily limit

GUILD TRADING:
├── Guild bank exists for item sharing
├── Guild trades still incur 6% fee (prevents AH bypass)
├── Guild bank has weekly deposit limits based on guild level
```

## D. Regional Market Variation

```
REGIONAL PRICING SYSTEM

Markets are SERVER-WIDE but items have REGIONAL PRICE DISPLAY:

How it works:
├── All listings visible everywhere
├── Regional "transport cost" added for distant purchases
├── Creates arbitrage opportunity without fragmenting market

TRANSPORT COSTS (Added to purchase price):
├── Same zone: 0%
├── Adjacent zone: 2%
├── Distant zone: 5%
├── Cross-faction zone: 10%

EXAMPLE:
Item listed in Tau space: 1,000T
├── Buying from Tau space: 1,000T
├── Buying from Imperial space: 1,050T (+5%)
├── Buying from Ork space: 1,100T (+10%)

This creates:
├── Regional price differences
├── Trader gameplay (buy low, sell high)
├── No market fragmentation (can always buy anything)
└── Thematic immersion (cross-faction trade is harder)
```

# VI. PRICING FORMULAS AND RANGES

## A. Base Value Calculations

```
ITEM VALUE FORMULA

Base_Value = Tier_Multiplier × Type_Multiplier × Quality_Modifier

TIER MULTIPLIERS:
├── T1: 10
├── T2: 50
├── T3: 200
├── T4: 800
├── T5: 3,200
├── Legendary: 15,000

TYPE MULTIPLIERS:
├── Material (raw): 1.0
├── Consumable: 1.5
├── Weapon: 5.0
├── Armor (per piece): 3.0
├── Accessory: 4.0
├── Cosmetic: 2.0

QUALITY MODIFIERS:
├── Common: 1.0
├── Uncommon: 1.5
├── Rare: 2.5
├── Epic: 5.0
├── Legendary: 10.0

EXAMPLES:
T3 Rare Weapon = 200 × 5.0 × 2.5 = 2,500T base
T4 Epic Armor = 800 × 3.0 × 5.0 = 12,000T base
T2 Common Material = 50 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 50T base
```

## B. Vendor Price Ranges

```
VENDOR BUY/SELL RATIOS

Category        | Sell to Vendor | Buy from Vendor | Ratio
----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------
Materials       | 20% of base    | 100% of base    | 1:5
Consumables     | 20% of base    | 100% of base    | 1:5
T1-2 Equipment  | 25% of base    | 100% of base    | 1:4
T3-4 Equipment  | 20% of base    | 100% of base    | 1:5
Salvage         | 15% of base    | N/A             | N/A

This ratio ensures:
├── Players always prefer AH over vendors
├── Vendors serve as price floor
├── Gold doesn't leak from economy through vendor manipulation
```

## C. Expected Market Prices

```
EXPECTED AH PRICE RANGES (Healthy Economy)

Materials (per unit):
├── T1: 2-8T (vendor floor: 2T)

├── T4: 400-1,000T
├── T5: 2,000-5,000T

├── T4: 3,000-15,000T
├── T5: 15,000-80,000T

# X. INFLATION PREVENTION

## A. Automated Systems

```
INFLATION MONITORING & RESPONSE

METRICS TRACKED:
├── Server gold supply (total in circulation)
├── Average player wealth (by level bracket)
├── AH price indices (material, equipment, consumable)
├── Gold velocity (transactions per day)
├── Sink rate (% of generated gold consumed)

ALERT THRESHOLDS:

GREEN (Healthy):
├── Wealth growth: 2-4% weekly
├── AH prices: ±10% monthly
├── Sink rate: 68-78%
├── Action: None

YELLOW (Monitor):
├── Wealth growth: 5-7% weekly
├── AH prices: ±15-25% monthly
├── Sink rate: 60-68% or 78-85%
├── Action: Increase sink opportunities, review drop rates

RED (Intervention):
├── Wealth growth: 8%+ weekly
├── AH prices: ±30%+ monthly
├── Sink rate: <60% or >85%
├── Action: Emergency measures

EMERGENCY MEASURES:
├── Temporary increased AH fees
├── Limited-time prestige sales (absorb gold)
├── Reduced drop rates on currency
├── Introduce new gold sinks (events, items)
```

## B. Structural Protections

```
BUILT-IN INFLATION CONTROLS

1. PROGRESSIVE TAXATION:
├── AH fees scale with transaction value
├── Higher value trades = higher % fee
├── Prevents wealth concentration

2. DECAY SYSTEMS:
├── Ork Teef: 1% weekly decay
├── Stale listings: Increased fees after 7 days
├── Unused guild funds: Maintenance costs

3. CONTENT GATING:
├── Gold alone cannot bypass progression
├── Time-gated materials require engagement
├── Prevents gold-rushing through content

4. SOFT CAPS:
├── Diminishing returns on farming
├── Daily quest limits
├── Weekly faction currency caps

5. GOLD SINKS SCALE WITH WEALTH:
├── Endgame repairs more expensive
├── Legendary crafting costs significant
├── Prestige items priced for wealth level
```

## C. Material Conversion Balancing

```
REVISED MATERIAL CONVERSION RATES

Previous (Exploitable):
├── 5 T1 → 1 T2 (100%)
├── 5 T2 → 1 T3 (100%)

REVISED SYSTEM:

Basic Conversion (NPC Vendor):
├── 10 T1 → 1 T2 (100% success)
├── 10 T2 → 1 T3 (100% success)
├── 8 T3 → 1 T4 (80% success)
├── 6 T4 → 1 T5 (60% success)

Skilled Conversion (Crafting Skill Required):
├── 8 T1 → 1 T2 (requires Crafting 25)
├── 8 T2 → 1 T3 (requires Crafting 50)
├── 6 T3 → 1 T4 (requires Crafting 75, 90% success)
├── 5 T4 → 1 T5 (requires Crafting 100, 75% success)

CATALYST REQUIREMENT (T4+):
├── T3→T4 conversion requires: Alchemical Catalyst (50T vendor)
├── T4→T5 conversion requires: Rare Catalyst (250T or boss drop)

This prevents:
├── T1 farming dominance
├── Infinite conversion chains
└── Trivializing higher content
```
