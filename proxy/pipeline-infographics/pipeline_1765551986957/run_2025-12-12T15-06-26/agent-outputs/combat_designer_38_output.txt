# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's legendary combat design, this system emphasizes **build diversity over gear dependency** and **player skill over time investment**. Combat should feel tactical, impactful, and distinctly Warhammer 40K.

**Core Principles:**
- Low time-to-kill creates tension and consequence
- Build synergy matters more than individual skill power
- Every profession brings unique, irreplaceable utility
- Faction identity extends to combat feel and rhythm
- Skill > Gear > Time invested

```

### Targeting System
- **Primary:** Tab-targeting for reliability (GW1 style)
- **Secondary:** Ground-targeted AoE for area denial
- **Tertiary:** Smart-targeting for healing/support (lowest HP ally)

### Action Economy
- **Skill Bar:** 8 active skills maximum (GW1's signature constraint)
- **Weapon Swap:** Instant, shares cooldown with weapon skills
- **Movement:** Full movement during most abilities
- **Interrupts:** 0.25 second window on cast-time abilities

# III. DAMAGE CALCULATION SYSTEM

## A. Core Damage Formula

```
DAMAGE CALCULATION PIPELINE

Step 1: Base Damage
├── Weapon Damage + Skill Coefficient
└── Modified by: Attribute bonuses

Step 2: Offensive Modifiers (capped at +50% total)
├── Might stacks (up to +50%)
├── Skill-specific bonuses
├── Faction resource bonuses (Zeal/Focus/WAAAGH!)
└── TOTAL CAP: +50% damage increase

Step 3: Critical Calculation
├── Crit Chance: Base 5% + modifiers (CAP: 35%)
├── Crit Damage: 2.0x (fixed)
└── Expected Value: 1 + (CritChance × 1.0)

Step 4: Defensive Reduction
├── Armor reduction (CAP: 23% at 150 armor)
├── Protection boon: -33% if active
└── Damage type resistance/vulnerability

Step 5: Final Damage
└── Apply to target health pool

COMPLETE FORMULA:
Final Damage = Base × min(1.50, OffensiveMod) × CritMod × (1 - ArmorRed) × TypeMod
```

## B. Armor and Resistance System

```
ARMOR FORMULA

Damage Reduction = Armor / (Armor + 500)

Armor Value | Reduction | Notes
------------|-----------|-------
0           | 0%        | Unarmored (Cultists)
50          | 9%        | Light armor (Robes)
100         | 17%       | Medium armor (Flak)
150         | 23%       | Heavy armor (Carapace) - SOFT CAP
200         | 29%       | Power armor equivalent
250         | 33%       | Terminator equivalent - HARD CAP

Note: Armor above 250 provides no additional benefit
```

### Resistance System
```
DAMAGE TYPE RESISTANCE

Each damage type can have:
├── Vulnerability: +25% damage taken
├── Neutral: Standard damage
├── Resistance: -25% damage taken
└── Immunity: 0 damage (rare, boss mechanic)

Resistances are binary, not stackable
Maximum resistance achievable: -25% per type
```

## C. Healing System

```
HEALING FORMULA

Base Healing = Skill Coefficient × Healing Power Attribute

HEALING EFFECTIVENESS DECAY (Anti-Heal-Tank Mechanic)
├── Combat Start: 100% healing effectiveness
├── Each second in combat: -2% effectiveness
├── Minimum effectiveness: 50% (reached at 25 seconds)
├── Reset: 5 seconds out of combat

HEALING CAP
├── Maximum healing per second: 10% of max HP
├── Burst healing cap: 40% of max HP per skill
└── Prevents: Infinite sustain builds

POISON INTERACTION
├── Poison condition: -33% healing received
├── Stacks with combat decay
└── Minimum healing: 33% effectiveness
```

---

├── Levels 11-20: Balanced
├── Levels 21-30: Enemy favored (requires skill/teamwork)
└── Level 30+: Group content required

ENEMY TIER MULTIPLIERS:
├── Fodder: 0.5x HP, 0.7x damage
├── Standard: 1.0x HP, 1.0x damage

ISSUE RESOLUTION

1. Faction Resources → Buff Cap: CONFIRMED

   2% effectiveness loss per second in combat,
   50% minimum, resets after 5 seconds OOC.

3. I-Frame Cap: IMPLEMENTED
   Maximum 30% uptime through dodge cooldowns
   and endurance costs.

4. Threat System: IMPLEMENTED
   3.0x multiplier for tank abilities,
   formula documented above.

5. CC Diminishing Returns: IMPLEMENTED
   100% → 50% → 25% → 12.5% → IMMUNE (10s)
   15 second reset timer.

6. Crit Cap Adjustment: ACCEPTED
   Reduced from 40% to 35% to prevent
   crit-stacking dominance.
