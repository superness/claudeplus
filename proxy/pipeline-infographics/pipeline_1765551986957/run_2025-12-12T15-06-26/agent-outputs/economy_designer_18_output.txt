# ECONOMY DESIGN DOCUMENT
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

---

# I. ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's successful economy model, this design prioritizes:

- **Player-driven markets** over vendor-centric economies
- **Meaningful trading** with robust anti-exploitation systems
- **Regional flavor** that reflects faction identities
- **Inflation prevention** through comprehensive sink systems
- **Accessible progression** without pay-to-win pathways

# VII. INFLATION PREVENTION SYSTEMS

## A. Diminishing Returns

```
DAILY EARNING CAPS

Gold Acquisition:
├── Soft cap: 8,500g/day from standard sources
├── Mechanism: After cap, gold drops reduced by 50%
├── Quest rewards: Uncapped (story must remain accessible)
├── AH profits: Uncapped (player-to-player, not generated)
└── Reset: Daily at 00:00 server time

Material Acquisition:
├── No hard caps on materials
├── Diminishing returns on gathering nodes
│   ├── First 20 nodes: Full yield
│   ├── Nodes 21-50: 75% yield
│   ├── Nodes 51+: 50% yield
│   └── Reset: Daily
└── Boss drops: Weekly lockouts on highest tier

Faction Currency:
├── Weekly caps per currency type
├── Prevents faction currency inflation
└── Encourages diverse activity

POST-CAP CONVERSION [NEW]:
├── After gold cap reached, continued play earns:
│   ├── 5% of gold → converted to faction currency
│   ├── Subject to weekly faction cap
│   └── Overflow → 1-hour XP boost
└── Purpose: Reward continued play without gold inflation
```

## B. Market Stabilization

```
ANTI-MANIPULATION SYSTEMS

Price Floor Protection:
├── Items cannot be listed below vendor sell price
├── Prevents race-to-bottom pricing
└── Maintains material value

Price Ceiling Alerts:
├── Items listed >300% of 7-day average: Warning displayed
├── Listing requires confirmation
└── Does not prevent listing (player choice)

Volume Monitoring:
├── Unusual transaction volumes flagged
├── Automated review for suspicious patterns
├── Manual review for confirmed anomalies
└── Consequences: Trade restrictions, investigation

Rare Item Controls:

├── Purpose: Prevents market flooding, maintains scarcity
└── Does not affect acquisition, only trading
```

## C. Currency Value Maintenance

```
GOLD VALUE PRESERVATION

Anchor Pricing:
├── Essential services (travel, repair) maintain fixed costs
├── Creates baseline gold value
└── Players always need gold for basics

Prestige Scaling:
├── High-end prestige items scale with server average wealth
├── Formula: Base Price × (1 + Server Wealth Index × 0.1)
├── Prevents early adopters from cornering prestige
└── Creates evergreen sinks

Emergency Levers (Reserved):
├── Temporary increased sink rates
├── Limited-time prestige offerings
├── Server-wide events with gold entry fees
└── Only activated if inflation >5%/month
