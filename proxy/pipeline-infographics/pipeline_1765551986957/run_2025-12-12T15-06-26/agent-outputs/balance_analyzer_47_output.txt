## 6. VERDICT

# **VERDICT: BROKEN** 🔴

### Summary of Critical Issues:

| Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Enemy HP scaling off by 10-15× | **CRITICAL** | Boss fights last 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes |
| WAAAGH! stack reaches +200% damage | **CRITICAL** | Ork-only parties trivialize all content |
| Markerlight stacks to +120% damage | **HIGH** | Tau-only parties trivialize all content |
| Supporting Fire chain exploit | **HIGH** | Single enemy attack triggers 8× counter |
| Permanent CC chains possible | **MEDIUM** | Removes enemy threat entirely |
| Plasma self-damage easily negated | **LOW** | Removes risk/reward from plasma weapons |
| 3 classes have no defined abilities | **CRITICAL** | Cannot evaluate 30% of content |

### Blocking Issues Before Combat System is Viable:

1. **Enemy HP must be increased 5-15× for Elite+ tiers**
2. **WAAAGH! mechanics need hard caps on stacking**
3. **Markerlight must be party-wide limited**
4. **CC immunity windows must be added**
5. **Sanctioned Psyker, Kroot, and Ethereal need full ability kits**

### What Works Well:

- Core damage formula is sound
- Skill slot system (GW1 style) is well-designed
- Energy economy is reasonable (no infinite loops that matter)
- Damage type effectiveness system adds strategic depth
- Class fantasy is strong and thematic

### Estimated Retuning Required:

- **30+ number changes** across enemy HP, ability multipliers, and buff caps
- **3 incomplete classes** need full ability design
- **4-5 new mechanics** (CC immunity, detection, death limits)

## BALANCE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

The combat *framework* is solid and captures Guild Wars 1's tactical depth well. However, the actual numbers create a fundamentally broken experience where:
- Early game is too slow (TTK 3× too long)
- Mid/late game is too fast (boss TTK 20× too short)
- Faction stacking (8 Orks or 8 Tau) dominates mixed parties by 100%+

**The system needs significant numerical retuning before it will deliver the intended experience.**
