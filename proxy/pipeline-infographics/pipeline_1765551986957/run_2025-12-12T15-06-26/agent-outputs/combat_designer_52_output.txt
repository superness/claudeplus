# Combat Systems Design Document
## Warhammer 40,000: Imperium Divided - Damocles Gulf Sector

# I. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY

Drawing from Guild Wars 1's design principles: **build diversity over gear dependency, skill synergy over stat stacking, and tactical depth over twitch reflexes**.

**Core Principles:**
- Combat is semi-real-time with pause-to-issue-orders (like GW1's active pause)
- Victory comes from build preparation and tactical adaptation, not reaction speed
- Every class has multiple viable roles based on skill selection
- Party composition matters but isn't rigidly enforced
- Death has meaning but isn't punishing

# II. COMBAT MECHANICS OVERVIEW

## A. Combat Model: Real-Time with Tactical Pause

```
COMBAT FLOW

Initiative Phase (Pre-Combat)
├── Detect enemies → Combat stance activated
├── Issue initial orders
└── Buffs/preparations can be cast

Active Combat (Real-Time)
├── Skills execute on cooldowns
├── Movement is free but affects accuracy
├── Pause available (solo/party leader only)
├── AI companions follow behavior presets
└── Energy regenerates continuously

Resolution Phase
├── Enemies defeated → Loot rolls
├── Party defeated → Respawn at checkpoint
└── Retreat available (costs morale)
```

## B. Core Combat Stats

# III. DAMAGE SYSTEM

## A. Damage Types

### Physical Damage Types

| Type | Source | Strong Against | Weak Against |
|------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Kinetic** | Bolters, autoguns | Unarmored, Vehicles | Heavy armor |
| **Energy** | Las-weapons, plasma | Armor, Shields | Vehicles |
| **Explosive** | Grenades, missiles | Groups, Cover | Single target |
| **Rending** | Chain weapons, claws | Armor, Organics | Machines |

### Special Damage Types

| Type | Source | Special Effect |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Warp** | Psyker powers | Ignores armor, causes Corruption |
| **Fire** | Flamers, incendiaries | DoT, spreads to nearby |
| **Toxic** | Poisons, chemicals | DoT, reduces healing |
| **Holy** | Faith powers | Bonus vs Chaos/Undead |
| **WAAAGH!** | Ork abilities | Scales with nearby Orks |

## B. Damage Calculation Formula

```
DAMAGE FORMULA

Base Damage = Weapon Damage × Skill Modifier

Modified Damage = Base Damage 
    × (1 + Attribute Bonus)
    × (1 + Buff Modifiers)          [ADDITIVE within category]
    × Critical Modifier (if crit)
    × Target Vulnerability

Final Damage = Modified Damage × (1 - Target DR) × (1 - Target Resistance)

BUFF STACKING RULES (per Balance Analyst):
├── Same buff type: Only highest value applies
├── Different buff types: Additive (capped at +100% total)
├── Multiplicative buffs: Maximum 2 can apply
└── Diminishing returns: 4th+ stack of any buff type = 50% effectiveness
```

### Damage Example

```
EXAMPLE: Bolter Shot

Weapon Damage: 45
Skill Modifier: 1.0 (basic shot)
Ballistics: 20 (+20% ranged damage)
Buffs: Blessed Ammunition (+15%), Target Lock (+10%)
Critical: No
Target: Ork Boy (0% vulnerability to kinetic)
Target Armor: 80 (28.6% DR)
Target Resistance: 0%

Calculation:
Base: 45 × 1.0 = 45
Modified: 45 × 1.20 × 1.25 = 67.5
Final: 67.5 × 0.714 = 48.2 damage
```

## C. Time-to-Kill Targets (Adjusted per Balance Analyst)

```
TTK TARGETS BY LEVEL BRACKET

Level 1-10 (Struggle Phase):
├── Standard Enemy: 6-8 seconds
├── Elite Enemy: 15-20 seconds
├── Boss: 90-150 seconds (party)
└── Player vs Player: 8-12 seconds

Level 11-20 (Competence Phase):
├── Standard Enemy: 4-6 seconds
├── Elite Enemy: 12-18 seconds
├── Boss: 60-120 seconds (party)
└── Player vs Player: 6-10 seconds

Level 21-30 (Mastery Phase):
├── Standard Enemy: 3-5 seconds
├── Elite Enemy: 10-15 seconds
├── Boss: 45-90 seconds (party)
└── Player vs Player: 5-8 seconds

Level 30+ (Power Fantasy):
├── Standard Enemy: 2-4 seconds

├── Blood Strike: Cleave attack, 200 damage, 180° arc
├── Skull Collector: Marks player, 10s later deals 500 damage if not cleansed
└── Mechanic: Players must cleanse marks using objective interacts

Phase 2 (70-40%):
├── Previous abilities continue
├── Blood Rain: AoE damage zones, must avoid
├── Rage of Khorne: +25% damage, +25% attack speed
└── Mechanic: Kill spawned Bloodletters to remove Rage stacks

Phase 3 (40-0%):
├── All previous abilities
├── Khorne's Favor: Heals 5% HP every 30s unless interrupted
├── Skull Throne: Pulls all players to center, massive AoE
└── Enrage: At 10 minutes, deals +200% damage

# XIII. BALANCE SUMMARY

## Current Status After Adjustments

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Damage Formulas | ✅ Balanced | Multiplicative caps implemented |
| Class Balance | ✅ Balanced | Mekboy/Fire Warrior buffed |
| Elite Skills | ✅ Balanced | Power levels appropriate |
| TTK Targets | ✅ Balanced | Progressive curve implemented |
| Exploits | ✅ Mitigated | All 5 critical exploits addressed |
| Perils System | ✅ Implemented | Psyker risk/reward balanced |
| Summon Cap | ✅ Implemented | 4 per party maximum |
| Armor Cap | ✅ Implemented | 150 (60% DR) hard cap |

## Known Design Tensions (Intended)

1. **Psyker Power vs Risk**: High damage balanced by Perils
2. **Ork Numbers vs Individual Power**: Party composition matters
3. **Tau Range vs Mobility**: Stance system creates tradeoffs
4. **Imperial Versatility vs Specialization**: Jack-of-all-trades design
