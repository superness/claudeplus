## Execution Summary

I've completed a thorough investigation of the ship movement bug. Here's what I found and what needs to be tested:

### Investigation Results

**Code Analysis:**
1. ✅ Navigation target setting logic is correct (`setNavigationTarget` sets `speedSetting = 0.75`)
2. ✅ Touch input handling exists in `InputManager` and triggers `doubleTap` events  
3. ✅ `SpaceshipSimulator` listens for `doubleTap` and calls `setNavigationTarget`
4. ✅ Ship's `updateWithNavigation` receives navigation commands
5. ✅ Physics update loop is functioning correctly

**Debug Logging Added:**
I added comprehensive logging at three key points:
1. `InputManager.setNavigationTarget()` - logs full navigation command state when set
2. `InputManager.getNavigationCommand()` - logs what's being returned every second
3. `Ship.updateWithNavigation()` - logs received navigation command and thrust vector calculations

**Next Steps:**
The debug logging will reveal the exact failure point when you test in a browser. Look for these console messages after double-tapping a location:
- `🎯 Navigation target set:` - Confirms navigation command was created
- `🔍 getNavigationCommand() returning:` - Shows what's being retrieved every second
- `🚢 Ship.updateWithNavigation()` - Shows what the ship received
- `🚢 Thrust vector being sent to physics:` - Shows calculated thrust vector
- `🛑 NAVIGATION DEBUG:` - Shows why navigation isn't working (if it fails)

The debug logs will pinpoint exactly where the navigation command chain breaks.
