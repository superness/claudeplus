## Evidence Analysis

After reviewing all available evidence files, I need to make a verification decision.

### Evidence Summary

**Evidence Files Analyzed:**
1. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json` - WebSocket connection refused
2. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332749906.json` - WebSocket connection refused
3. `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763333162727.json` - WebSocket timeout after connection
4. `ship_movement_bug_execution_report.json` - WebSocket server not running
5. `test-ship-movement-bug-gamerunner.js` - Test automation script (not executed)

### Runtime Evidence Assessment

**Critical Finding**: ❌ **No Runtime Evidence Captured**

All evidence files show **WebSocket connection failures** or **timeouts**:
- Evidence file 1: `"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765"`
- Evidence file 2: `"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765"`
- Evidence file 3: WebSocket connected briefly then closed, test timed out
- Execution report: `"rootCause": "WebSocket automation server not running"`

**State Snapshots**: None captured
- `stateSnapshots: []` in all files
- No `getShipState` responses
- No command/response logs from actual game execution

**Commands Executed**: None
- All evidence files show empty `commands: []` arrays
- No throttle setting, no navigation commands, no ship state queries
- Test infrastructure failed before any commands could be sent

### Verification Analysis

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "All reproduction attempts failed due to WebSocket automation infrastructure not being available. No runtime evidence was captured showing actual ship behavior, navigation commands, or physics updates.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "None - all connections refused or timed out",
    "stateInconsistency": "Cannot assess - no state snapshots captured",
    "matchesBugReport": "Cannot verify - bug requires runtime testing",
    "infrastructureIssues": [
      "WebSocket server not running on port 8765",
      "TestingBrowserBridge not connected",
      "No game state snapshots captured",
      "Automation framework incomplete"
    ]
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Alternative 1: Manual browser console testing using window.simulator",
    "Alternative 2: Start WebSocket server and retry automated testing",
    "Alternative 3: Direct code analysis with debug logging in browser DevTools",
    "Alternative 4: Use browser's inspect element to verify ship position changes"
  ],
  "rootCause": "Cannot confirm bug existence without runtime evidence. The automation infrastructure (WebSocket server, game connection, command API) did not function during reproduction attempts."
}
```

### Why This Is INCONCLUSIVE

According to the verification requirements:

**❌ ALWAYS RETURN "INCONCLUSIVE" IF:**
- ✅ No WebSocket automation logs provided (all connection failures)
- ✅ No evidence.json file from test execution (files exist but show errors, not test results)
- ✅ No game state snapshots captured (all files show empty snapshots)
- ✅ Only static code analysis (previous stage added debug logs but didn't run game)

**The evidence shows:**
- Test infrastructure failures, not bug confirmation
- No actual game commands executed
- No ship state before/after comparisons
- No navigation target setting attempts
- No throttle application tests

### Recommended Next Steps

Since WebSocket automation is unavailable, alternative approaches are needed:

1. **Manual Browser Testing**: Open `index.html` in Chrome, open DevTools console, and manually test:
   ```javascript
   // Get ship position before
   window.simulator.playerShip.position
   
   // Double-tap a location in space
   // Observe if position changes
   
   // Check navigation state
   window.simulator.inputManager.getNavigationCommand()
   ```

2. **Debug Log Review**: The previous stage added debug logging to `InputManager.js` and `Ship.js`. Load the game and check browser console for these logs when attempting to navigate.

3. **Direct Physics Testing**: Use browser console to force movement:
   ```javascript
   window.simulator.playerShip.throttle = 1.0
   // Wait a few seconds
   // Check if position changed
   ```

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence - WebSocket automation infrastructure failed, cannot confirm bug without actual game execution data)
