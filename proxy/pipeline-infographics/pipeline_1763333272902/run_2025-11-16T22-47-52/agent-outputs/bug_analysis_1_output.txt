Looking at this bug report, I need to analyze the ship movement issue systematically.

## Bug Analysis

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship is completely unresponsive to movement commands - does not move when navigation targets are set or locations are tapped",
  "expectedBehavior": "Ship should move to tapped locations in space and respond to navigation target commands using EVE-style physics (acceleration curves, velocity changes)",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary despite user input (taps/clicks to set navigation targets). No movement, acceleration, or velocity changes occur.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "ship_movement",
    "ship_physics",
    "navigation",
    "input_handling",
    "mobile_touch_controls"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in a web browser",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and ship to appear in space",
    "Step 3: Tap/click on a location in space to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe that ship does not move toward the target",
    "Step 5: Try setting navigation via other methods (object grid, HUD)",
    "Step 6: Observe ship remains completely stationary"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [

    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Likely causes: (1) Navigation target is being set but ship physics is not processing it - missing update loop call or physics integration broken, (2) Input handler is not properly setting navigation targets on the ship, (3) Ship's acceleration/velocity calculation is broken or disabled, (4) NavigationManager is not properly communicating target to ship physics system, (5) Integration between MobileInputManager double-tap and ship navigation is broken",
  "investigationPriority": [
    "1. Check if navigation targets are being set correctly (console logs in input handlers)",
    "2. Verify ship physics update loop is being called in main game loop",
    "3. Examine Ship.navigateTo() and related navigation methods",
    "4. Check ShipPhysics acceleration and velocity calculations",
    "5. Verify integration between InputManager/MobileInputManager and ship navigation",
    "6. Review recent git changes that may have broken movement (git status shows multiple modified files)"
  ],
  "contextClues": {
    "recentChanges": "Git status shows modified files including Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, StationManager.js - recent changes may have broken movement",
    "architecture": "EVE-style physics with exponential acceleration curves, 60Hz fixed timestep physics loop",
    "inputSystems": "Dual input: desktop (InputManager click) and mobile (MobileInputManager double-tap)",
    "evidenceFiles": "ship_movement_bug_evidence_*.json files exist - previous debugging attempts"
  }
}
```

## Key Investigation Areas

Based on the codebase architecture and bug symptoms:

1. **Physics Update Loop**: Verify `ShipPhysics.updateVelocity()` is being called every frame at 60Hz
2. **Navigation Target Setting**: Check if `Ship.navigateTo(target)` is being called when user taps
3. **Input Event Flow**: Trace from click/tap → InputManager/MobileInputManager → Ship navigation
4. **Velocity Calculation**: Verify EVE-style acceleration formula is calculating non-zero velocities
5. **Position Updates**: Confirm ship position is being updated based on velocity

## Reproduction Confidence

**HIGH** - This is a critical, always-occurring bug affecting core gameplay. Should be easily reproducible by simply loading the game and attempting to move.
