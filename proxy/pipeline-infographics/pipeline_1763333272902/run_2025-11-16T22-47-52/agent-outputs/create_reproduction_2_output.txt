Perfect! Now let me create the output summary for the reproduction script:

## Ship Movement Bug Reproduction Script Created

I've successfully created a comprehensive automated reproduction script for the ship movement bug.

### Script Details

**Script Path**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`

**Purpose**: Systematically test ship movement functionality to identify why the ship is not moving when throttle is applied or navigation targets are set.

### Test Flow

The script uses the game's WebSocket automation framework to execute the following sequence:

1. **Get Initial State** - Capture baseline ship position and velocity
2. **Apply 50% Throttle** - Set throttle and wait 2 seconds
3. **Check Velocity Change** - Verify if ship has accelerated
4. **Reset to Origin** - Teleport ship to (0,0,0) for controlled testing
5. **Reset Throttle** - Set throttle to 0%
6. **Verify Reset** - Confirm ship is at origin with zero velocity
7. **Apply 100% Throttle** - Set full throttle and wait 3 seconds
8. **Check Movement** - Compare position and velocity against baseline
9. **Reset Throttle** - Clean up test state

### Command Sequence

```javascript
[
  {command: 'getShipState', desc: 'Get initial ship state'},
  {command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 50}, desc: 'Set throttle to 50%'},
  {command: 'getShipState', desc: 'Check velocity after throttle applied'},
  {command: 'setPosition', params: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}, desc: 'Reset ship to origin'},
  {command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 0}, desc: 'Reset throttle to 0%'},
  {command: 'getShipState', desc: 'Verify ship at origin'},
  {command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 100}, desc: 'Set throttle to 100%'},
  {command: 'getShipState', desc: 'Check if ship moved after 3 seconds'},
  {command: 'setThrottle', params: {value: 0}, desc: 'Reset throttle'}
]
```

### Bug Detection Logic

The script detects the bug if:
- Position remains unchanged after 3 seconds at 100% throttle
- Velocity remains at zero (< 0.01 in all axes)

If both conditions are true, the script logs:
```
🐛 BUG CONFIRMED: Ship is not moving despite 100% throttle!
```

### Evidence Output

The script saves comprehensive evidence to:
```
ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json
```

Contains:
- All commands executed
- All responses received
- State snapshots (position/velocity) at key points
- Bug confirmation status
- Likely root causes if bug is confirmed

### WebSocket Architecture

The script implements the proper game automation architecture:

1. **Starts WebSocket server** on port 8765
2. **Launches game** with `?testMode=true` parameter
3. **Waits for game connection** (browser → server)
4. **Connects test client** to send commands
5. **Routes messages** between game and test client
6. **Executes test sequence** with verification
7. **Saves evidence** and exits with appropriate code

### Exit Codes

- **0**: Ship movement working correctly (bug not reproduced)
- **1**: Bug confirmed (ship not moving) OR test error

### Expected Outcome

Based on the bug report, this script will likely **confirm the bug** and save evidence showing:
- Ship position unchanged despite 100% throttle
- Ship velocity remaining at zero
- No acceleration or movement detected

This evidence will help identify the root cause in:
- Physics update loop (js/physics/ShipPhysics.js)
- Ship entity logic (js/entities/Ship.js)
- Navigation system (js/systems/NavigationManager.js)
- Input handling (js/core/InputManager.js, js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js)
