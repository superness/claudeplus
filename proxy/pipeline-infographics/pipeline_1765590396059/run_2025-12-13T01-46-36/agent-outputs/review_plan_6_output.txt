I've now reviewed all the relevant design documents. The player-experience document doesn't contain henchmen/hero specifications. Let me provide my final review.

---

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Verified Specifications (Correct from Docs)

The extractor correctly identified:
1. **Party max: 4 members** (`api-specification.md:1413-1414`)
2. **Summon limit: 2 active constructs** (`combat-design.md:336`)
3. **Water Caste Drone Relay stats: 60 DPS, 150 HP, 30 sec** (`combat-design.md:578-579`)
4. **Enemy types: COMMON, ELITE, BOSS, MINI_BOSS, WORLD_BOSS** (`data-model.md:1160`)
5. **Attribute system with soft/hard caps** (`combat-design.md:45-52`)
6. **Health formula: 200 + (Level × 20) + (Toughness × 5)** (`combat-design.md:56-61`)
7. **Solo/Group encounter templates** (`combat-design.md:1050-1094`)

### Critical Missing Information

**1. HENCHMEN/HEROES ARE NOT IN THE DESIGN DOCS**

This is the most critical gap. The extracted requirements correctly note this as "PROPOSED NEW DESIGN" but then proceed to invent specifics:
- Proposed henchman types (Guardsman Conscript, Hospitaller, etc.) - **INVENTED**
- Proposed stat ratios (70-80% for henchmen, 85-95% for heroes) - **INVENTED**
- Proposed hero customization - **INVENTED**

The user said: "Make sure to use henchmen/heroes" referencing **Guild Wars 1** specifically. GW1 henchmen/heroes have well-documented mechanics that should be researched, not invented.

**Missing GW1 henchmen/hero specifics:**
- GW1 party cap was 8 in most areas (not 4)
- Heroes had fully customizable skill bars (8 skills)
- Henchmen had fixed builds, could not be customized
- Heroes could be flagged/commanded on the battlefield
- Resurrection mechanics for fallen henchmen/heroes

**2. THREAT TIER SYSTEM (Darktide) NOT RESEARCHED**

The user explicitly referenced "minoris, majoris, extremis, terminus" from **Darktide**. The extracted requirements propose HP/damage multipliers but these are **INVENTED**, not from Darktide research.

**3. DESIGN DECISIONS REQUIRED BUT NOT HIGHLIGHTED PROPERLY**

The extractor lists "DECISION REQUIRED" questions but doesn't propose a clear resolution path. Key decisions:
- Replace existing enemy_type OR add parallel system?
- Can 4-player parties include henchmen?
- Do heroes gain XP or match player level?

### Docs Consulted (Confirmed Complete)
- `combat-design.md` ✓
- `data-model.md` ✓
- `api-specification.md` ✓
- `progression-design.md` ✓
- `player-experience.md` ✓

### Red Flags Found

1. **Invented mechanics for henchmen/heroes** - Not grounded in GW1 research
2. **Invented threat tier multipliers** - Not grounded in Darktide research
3. **Generic placeholders** like "70-80% player power" without GW1 reference

### What Needs to Happen

The requirements need to either:
1. **Research GW1 mechanics** for accurate henchmen/hero implementation
2. **Research Darktide** for accurate threat tier values
3. **Get user confirmation** on proposed invented values

OR

4. **Proceed with proposed values as NEW DESIGN** with explicit user acknowledgment that these are original designs, not GW1/Darktide faithful recreations

### Recommendation

Before proceeding to implementation, the extraction should clarify:
- Are the henchmen/hero proposed specs acceptable as NEW DESIGN (not GW1 faithful)?
- Are the threat tier multipliers acceptable as NEW DESIGN (not Darktide faithful)?
- What is the decision on enemy_type integration?
