I have gathered extensive information from the design documents. Now let me provide the complete requirements extraction for the Henchmen/Heroes system.

## Feature: Henchmen/Heroes System

### Specifications from Design Docs

#### Key Discovery: NO EXPLICIT HENCHMAN/HERO DOCUMENTATION EXISTS

After extensive search through all design documents, **there is NO explicit specification for a henchmen/heroes system** in the current design documentation. The user explicitly requested this feature ("Henchman fit in perfectly to the 40k system", "Make sure to use henchmen\heros"), but it has not been designed yet.

However, the design docs contain several RELATED systems and specifications that inform how this should be implemented:

---

### Existing Related Systems (From Design Docs)

#### 1. Summon/Pet System (Tech-Priest Reference Implementation)
From `combat-design.md`:
```
### 3. TECH-PRIEST (Pet/Support)
**Role:** Drone controller and equipment support
**Summon Limit:** 2 active constructs maximum

CYBERNETICA LINE (Summons)
├── Servo-Skull: Summon scout drone, 15 sec CD, 15 energy
│   └── Reveals enemies, 60 HP, 60 sec duration
├── Gun Servitor: Summon combat drone, 30 sec CD, 25 energy
│   └── 80 DPS, 200 HP, 45 sec duration
├── Kataphron Breacher: Summon heavy, 45 sec CD, 35 energy
│   └── 120 DPS, 400 HP, 30 sec duration, 2-summon limit enforced
└── Knight Crusader: Summon walker, 120 sec CD, 50 energy
    └── 200 DPS, 800 HP, 30 sec duration, replaces other summons
```

#### 2. Other Faction Summons
From `combat-design.md`:
- **Tau - Pathfinder**: `Deploy Drone: Summon recon drone, 20 sec CD, 15 energy - Marks enemies, 100 HP, 30 sec duration (counts toward 2-summon limit)`
- **Tau - Crisis Suit**: `Drone Swarm: Summon 3 gun drones, 25 sec CD, 30 energy - 40 DPS each, 80 HP each, 20 sec duration (counts as 1 toward limit)`
- **Tau - Water Caste**: `Drone Relay: Summon combat drone, 20 sec CD, 20 energy - 60 DPS, 150 HP, 30 sec duration, drone attacks marked targets`
- **Ork - Kommando**: `Distraction Grot: Summon decoy, 20 sec CD, 18 energy - Enemies attack decoy for 5 seconds`

#### 3. Summon Balance Rules
From `emergence-analysis.md`:
```
- Clarify: 2 combat summons + 1 utility summon PER PLAYER (global)
- Drone Swarm (3 drones) counts as 1 combat summon
- Maximum 8 combat summons per 4-player party
```

From `data-model.md`:
```sql
-- Summon limits (for Tech-Priest, etc.)
max_combat_summons  INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
max_utility_summons INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
```

#### 4. Party System (Already Defined)
From `api-specification.md`:
```
POST /api/v1/parties - Creates a new party
├── "party_type": "OPEN", "FRIENDS", "PRIVATE"
├── max_size: 4
POST /api/v1/parties/{party_id}/invite - Invites a player to party
```

From `data-model.md`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE parties (
    party_id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    party_type          VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'OPEN',  -- OPEN, FRIENDS, PRIVATE
    party_status        VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'FORMING',  -- FORMING, IN_CONTENT, DISBANDED
);
CREATE TABLE party_members (...);
```

#### 5. Combat Flow & Ally Mechanics
From `combat-design.md`:
```
Skills referencing allies:
├── Blessed Refrain: Party +20% armor, 20 sec CD, 20 energy
├── Passion of the Saint: Redirect 50% ally damage, 25 sec CD, 30 energy
├── Resurrection: Revive ally 50% HP, 90 sec CD, 40 energy
├── Emperor's Mercy: Party heal 200, 30 sec CD, 35 energy
├── Righteous Blow: 120 damage, +50% if target attacking ally
├── Shield Projection: 200 HP barrier on ally, 15 sec CD, 20 energy
├── Heroic Intervention: Jump to ally + shield them, 25 sec CD, 25 energy
├── Words of Courage: +20% damage to ally, 10 sec CD, 12 energy
├── Coordinated Strike: 80 damage, +50% if ally attacked target recently
```

#### 6. Content Design - Solo vs Group
From `combat-design.md`:
```
SOLO CONTENT DESIGN
Solo Encounter Template:
├── 3-5 common enemies OR 1 elite
├── Mini-Boss: 3-5 minutes
├── Boss: 5-10 minutes

GROUP CONTENT DESIGN (4-player)
├── Trash Pack: 6-10 common enemies with 1-2 elites
├── Recommended: Full party (4)
├── Party wipe = mission failure (Nightmare)
```

#### 7. Enemy Classifications (User Mentioned: minoris/majoris/extremis/terminus)
From `data-model.md` (Classification fields exist but values not specified):
```sql
-- Classification columns exist in multiple tables
```
**NOTE: The user's specific minoris/majoris/extremis/terminus (white/blue/yellow/purple) classification is NOT in the design docs** - this appears to be a new feature request.
