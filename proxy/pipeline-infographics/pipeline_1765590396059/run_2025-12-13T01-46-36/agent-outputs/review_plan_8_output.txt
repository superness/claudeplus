Now I have thoroughly reviewed the design documents. Let me compile my review of the extracted requirements.

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### What's Correct in the Extracted Requirements

The extracted requirements accurately capture:
- GW1 Henchmen mechanics (fixed skills, no customization)
- GW1 Heroes mechanics (full skill/attribute customization, flag system, stances)
- 104% movement speed for companions (authentic GW1 detail)
- Correct attribution of threat tier system to Space Marine 2 (not Darktide)
- Minoris/Majoris/Extremis/Terminus classification with color coding (white/blue/yellow/purple)

### Missing Information

**1. Critical: Level Cap Discrepancy**
- Extracted requirements state "Level cap: 30"
- But from `progression-design.md` line 27-28:
  - "Level Cap: 30 (Guild Wars 1 style - achievable, not endless)"
- However, the requirements reference "level 10, level 15" bonuses for Heroes that mirror GW1's level 20 cap system, not level 30
- **Need clarification:** Should hero attribute bonuses occur at levels 10 and 15, or at levels 15 and 20 (scaled from GW1's 20 cap)?

**2. Party Size Specifications**
- From `api-specification.md` lines 1406-1430 and `systems-integration.md` line 183-193:
  - Standard party size: 4 players
  - Raid content: 8 players
  - The extracted requirements mention "4, 6, 8, or 12" but docs show primarily 4 and 8
- **Need verification:** Are 6 and 12 player configurations supported, or just 4 and 8?

**3. Summon Limit Clarification**
- From `combat-design.md` line 336: "Summon Limit: 2 active constructs maximum" (Tech-Priest specific)
- The requirements correctly state Heroes/Henchmen are NOT summons
- But should clarify: Does adding a Hero that is a Tech-Priest with summons affect the player's summon limit?

**4. Henchman/Hero Archetypes Missing Details**
- The requirements created archetypes (Guardsman, Medicae, Ogryn, Psyker Adept, etc.) but these are **NOT in the design documents**
- These appear to be reasonable extrapolations but are **invented requirements**
- Design docs don't specify which henchmen/heroes should exist
- **Red Flag:** This is inventing content not in the source docs

**5. Faction Lock Implementation**
- Requirements state "Imperial heroes only available to Imperial players"
- But from `progression-design.md` line 1517-1524, the secondary profession system allows cross-class access
- **Need clarification:** Can a player have a Hero from a different faction if they have cross-faction progression?

**6. Death Penalty Not Specified**
- Requirements list this as "Open Design Decision"
- But from `combat-design.md` lines 1016-1043, death penalty is defined by difficulty mode:
  - Normal: respawn at waypoint, minor durability loss
  - Hard: respawn at checkpoint, moderate durability loss
  - Veteran: 3 respawns per mission
  - Nightmare: party wipe = failure
- Heroes/Henchmen should inherit these rules but specific behavior not defined

**7. Missing: WebSocket Combat Tick Integration**
- Requirements mention "Integrate companion AI into combat tick"
- But `api-specification.md` line 1214 shows server tick rate: 20 ticks/second
- Should specify how companion AI integrates with this tick rate

### Docs to Check

1. **Re-read combat-design.md** for:
   - Existing party composition examples
   - Death penalty specifics by difficulty
   - How summons from Tech-Priest/Crisis Suit interact with party limits

2. **Check for any henchmen/heroes references** that may have been missed:
   - Search for "henchmen", "companion", "follower" in all docs
   - The requirements created archetypes that don't exist in source docs

3. **Verify party sizes** from systems-integration.md and api-specification.md

### Red Flags Found

1. **Invented Henchman/Hero archetypes** - The 12 henchmen and 12 hero templates listed are reasonable extrapolations from the class system but are NOT specified in the design documents. This creates risk of implementing something the designers didn't intend.

2. **Generic database schema** - The SQL tables look reasonable but weren't validated against the existing `data-model.md` which has detailed schemas. Should align with existing table patterns.

3. **Hero attribute bonus timing** - "+15 bonus at level 10, +15 at level 15" appears to be adapted from GW1's level 20 cap without validation against this game's level 30 cap.
