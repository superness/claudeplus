Now I have reviewed the design documents. Let me provide my review assessment.

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Verified Specifications (What Was Correct)

The extraction correctly identified:
1. **Summon mechanics from Tech-Priest**: 2 combat summons + 1 utility summon limit per player (verified in `combat-design.md:336`)
2. **Party size**: 4 players max (verified in `api-specification.md` and `data-model.md`)
3. **Skill bar structure**: 8 regular slots + 1 elite slot (verified in `combat-design.md:28`)
4. **Existing ally/support skills**: Correctly quoted from `combat-design.md`
5. **Tau Drone mechanics**: Pathfinder's drone counts toward summon limit (verified at `combat-design.md:474`)
6. **Secondary profession trial**: Level 5-8 trial period with 50% effectiveness (verified in `progression-design.md`)

### Missing Information

**1. NO HENCHMEN/HEROES SYSTEM EXISTS IN DESIGN DOCS**
The extraction correctly notes this is a NEW FEATURE REQUEST, not a documented system. The requirements derived are reasonable extrapolations based on:
- Existing summon mechanics
- GW1 reference patterns
- 40K lore

HOWEVER, the derived specifications are INVENTED, not extracted from docs. This is acceptable as a "requirements proposal" but should be clearly marked as such.

**2. Enemy Threat Tier System (minoris/majoris/extremis/terminus)**
The user explicitly requested: "white, blue, yellow, purple enemies" with "minoris, majoris, extremis, terminus classifications"

From `data-model.md:1160`:
```
enemy_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- COMMON, ELITE, BOSS, MINI_BOSS, WORLD_BOSS
```

**This is NOT the same as the user's requested Darktide-style threat tiers.** The existing design uses:
- COMMON, ELITE, BOSS, MINI_BOSS, WORLD_BOSS

The user wants a different system inspired by Darktide:
- MINORIS (white) - fodder enemies
- MAJORIS (blue) - standard enemies  
- EXTREMIS (yellow) - elite/special enemies
- TERMINUS (purple) - boss-tier enemies

This is a NEW DESIGN REQUEST that should be explicitly called out as an addition, not extracted.

**3. Henchman/Hero Stat Values Are Guesses**
The extraction proposes:
- "~80% of player equivalents" for henchmen
- "90-100% player equivalent stats" for heroes

These numbers are NOT from the design docs - they are reasonable derivations but should be marked as "PROPOSED" not "EXTRACTED."

### Docs to Check
- No additional docs needed - the system doesn't exist

### Critical Note on Classification

The requirements extraction should be split into:

1. **EXTRACTED REQUIREMENTS** (from docs):
   - Summon limit mechanics
   - Party size constraints
   - Existing ally skill interactions

2. **PROPOSED NEW FEATURES** (not in docs, must be designed):
   - Henchmen system (entire feature)
   - Heroes system (entire feature)
   - Threat tier classification (minoris/majoris/extremis/terminus)
   - Color coding for enemies
   - Henchman AI behaviors
   - Hero customization systems

### Recommendation

The requirements document should:
1. Clearly label what is EXTRACTED vs PROPOSED
2. Note that the henchmen/heroes system requires design decisions from the user
3. Confirm whether the user wants to REPLACE the existing enemy_type system (COMMON/ELITE/BOSS) with the Darktide-style threat tiers, or ADD it as a parallel classification
4. Get user input on key design decisions:
   - Should henchmen have fixed or customizable builds?
   - How many heroes per faction?
   - How do threat tiers map to existing enemy types?
