### Why This Feature
The user explicitly mentioned "Henchman fit in perfectly to the 40k system" and "Make sure to use henchmen/heroes" - this is a core GW1 mechanic that's NOT yet implemented. The search for "hench|hero|companion|ally" in the client folder returned only library files (no game code).

The client has:
- All basic gameplay features complete
- Full skill/class system
- Enemy templates with faction support
- Party frame UI (exists but only shows placeholder data)

What's missing for the GW1 experience:
1. **Henchmen/Heroes** - NPCs that join your party and fight alongside you (critical for small tactical missions)
2. **Threat Classification** - minoris/majoris/extremis/terminus (white/blue/yellow/purple) enemy indicators as mentioned by user
3. **Combat server validation** - mentioned as needing work

Given the user's emphasis on henchmen being "perfect for 40K", this should be the next feature.
