## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - A comprehensive Three.js-based 3D game client exists in `/client/`
- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation exists:
  - `combat-design.md` - Full combat system with 12 classes, damage types, status effects
  - `systems-integration.md` - Complete integration design with balance grades
  - `progression-design.md` - Level progression systems
  - `balance-analysis.md` / `balance-audit.md` - Balance documentation
  - `api-specification.md` - API specs
  - `data-model.md` - Data structures
  - Plus additional analysis docs
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express backend with:
  - Auth system (JWT + refresh tokens)
  - Character models (3 factions, 12 classes)
  - Combat service with damage calculations
  - WebSocket combat handler
  - PostgreSQL database layer with migrations
  - Skill definitions and validation
- **Can run**: Yes - Both backend (`npm run dev`) and client (`cd client && npm run dev`) have scripts

### Client Implementation Status:
The client has a substantial foundation:
- Three.js 3D renderer with grim dark atmosphere
- Player character with movement and collision
- Third-person camera (Guild Wars 1 style)
- Entity manager with demo enemies from all factions
- Combat system with damage types, armor penetration, status effects
- Skill bar UI (8+1 elite slot)
- Full skill system with cooldowns and effects
- Input management (WASD, targeting, skills 1-8/0)

### What's Working:
- 3D world with gothic buildings, atmospheric particles
- Player movement with collision detection
- Enemy spawning (Imperial, Tau, Ork, Tyranid, Chaos)
- Target selection (Tab/Click)
- Skill bar with visual feedback
- Basic combat damage calculations

## Recommendation

The game client **already exists** and has a solid Guild Wars 1-style foundation. The user mentioned "combat needs more validation" - the backend combat service exists but needs the client-side combat to be fully connected and validated against server state. The client also needs:

1. **Combat validation** - Skill usage should validate against server
2. **Henchmen/Heroes system** - Not yet implemented (perfect for 40K)
3. **Enemy threat classification** - Minoris/Majoris/Extremis/Terminus (white/blue/yellow/purple) visual indicators
4. **Skill diversity** - More skills implementing the design doc specifications
