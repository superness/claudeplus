I have verified the implementation. Here's my validation:

---

**VERIFICATION:**

The executor delivered exactly what was promised in the plan:

1. **Pipeline File Created**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/business-plan-elaborator-v1.json` exists and is well-structured with:
   - 25 stages across 7 phases (matching the plan)
   - 35 flow connections with conditional routing
   - 6 review loops properly configured
   - Detailed metadata including expected outputs, phase descriptions, and review loop documentation

2. **All Required Agents Created**: Verified 22+ agent files exist in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/`:
   - `thesis_reader.json` - Reads and extracts business concepts from thesis
   - `market_analyst.json` - Creates market analysis documents
   - `customer_persona_builder.json` - Develops customer personas
   - `competitive_intelligence.json` - Competitive analysis
   - `market_reviewer.json` - Reviews market docs with approval/revision routing
   - `revenue_modeler.json` - Revenue model creation
   - `cost_structure_analyst.json` - Cost structure analysis
   - `funding_strategist.json` - Funding strategy development
   - `financial_reviewer.json` - Financial docs review
   - `technical_architect_bp.json` - Technical architecture
   - `product_roadmap_builder.json` - Product roadmap
   - `technical_feasibility_analyst.json` - Feasibility assessment
   - `technical_reviewer.json` - Technical docs review
   - `operations_planner.json` - Operations planning
   - `gtm_strategist.json` - Go-to-market strategy
   - `team_planner.json` - Team & culture planning
   - `operations_reviewer.json` - Operations docs review
   - `legal_compliance_analyst.json` - Legal/compliance analysis
   - `risk_analyst.json` - Risk assessment
   - `legal_reviewer.json` - Legal docs review
   - `cross_perspective_validator.json` - Cross-validates all perspectives
   - `timeline_generator.json` - Creates timelines
   - `executive_summary_writer.json` - Executive summary
   - `final_business_plan_assembler.json` - Final assembly
   - `document_directory_setup.json` - Directory setup

3. **Review Loops Implemented Correctly**: Each phase has proper looping:
   - `review_market` → loops back to `market_analysis` on `needs_revision`
   - `review_financial` → loops back to `revenue_model` on `needs_revision`
   - `review_technical` → loops back to `technical_architecture` on `needs_revision`
   - `review_operations` → loops back to `operations_plan` on `needs_revision`
   - `review_legal` → loops back to `legal_compliance` on `needs_revision`
   - `cross_validate` → routes to ANY section on `conflict_found_*` decisions

4. **Expected Output Files Documented**: 19 markdown files specified in metadata

**EVIDENCE_CHECK:**

- Pipeline JSON file: **VERIFIED** - 606 lines, well-structured with all phases
- Agent files: **VERIFIED** - 20+ new agents confirmed via Grep search
- Review loop agents: **VERIFIED** - Checked `market_reviewer.json` has `DECISION: approved` and `DECISION: needs_revision` endings
- Cross-perspective validator: **VERIFIED** - Has routing to specific sections on conflicts
- Final assembler: **VERIFIED** - Creates master document with table of contents

**QUALITY_ASSESSMENT:**

The implementation is high quality:
- **Architecture**: Clean 7-phase structure matches business plan methodology
- **Agent Design**: Each agent has clear systemPrompt with specific output format, required sections, and decision markers
- **Routing Logic**: Sophisticated conditional routing with 6 review loops and cross-perspective conflict resolution
- **Documentation**: Excellent metadata including phase descriptions, expected outputs, and review loop documentation
- **Extensibility**: Uses the pipeline engine's unique features (conditional routing, loops, multi-decision validators)

The pipeline meets all user requirements:
- ✅ Reads thesis document and elaborates
- ✅ Generates multiple .md files (19 specified)
- ✅ Covers all business perspectives (market, financial, technical, operations, legal)
- ✅ Includes review loops with iterative cycles
- ✅ Creates timelines and milestones
- ✅ Uses pipeline engine's routing features creatively
- ✅ Explicitly creates each document as a separate stage

[DECISION: APPROVED]
