Now I have a comprehensive understanding of everything needed. Let me create a plan for this comprehensive Business Plan Elaboration Pipeline.

---

**UNDERSTANDING:** 
The user wants a pipeline that takes the MineBox thesis refinement document and expands it into a complete business plan with documentation from all business perspectives. The pipeline should:
1. Generate multiple markdown files (not execute anything)
2. Include review loops between agents
3. Create timelines and milestones
4. Cover all business perspectives (market, finance, technical, operations, legal, etc.)
5. Use the pipeline engine's unique features (routing decisions, conditional flows, loops)
6. Explicitly create each document as a pipeline stage

**APPROACH:**
Create a comprehensive "Business Plan Elaboration Pipeline" with 30+ stages organized into:
1. **Input & Analysis Phase** - Read and parse the thesis document
2. **Market Perspective Loop** - Market research, competitor analysis, customer personas (with review cycle)
3. **Financial Perspective Loop** - Revenue models, projections, funding strategy (with review cycle)
4. **Technical Perspective Loop** - Architecture, implementation roadmap, technical feasibility (with review cycle)
5. **Operations Perspective Loop** - Launch plan, supply chain, customer support (with review cycle)
6. **Legal/Compliance Perspective Loop** - Terms of service, privacy, regulatory (with review cycle)
7. **Executive Summary Phase** - Synthesize all perspectives
8. **Timeline Generation Phase** - Create milestones, roadmaps, Gantt-style documents
9. **Final Integration & Review** - Cross-perspective validation

Each perspective loop has: Draft → Review → Revise → Approve pattern

**STEPS:**

1. **Create new agents** for business plan elaboration:
   - `thesis_analyzer` - Parses the input thesis document
   - `market_analyst` - Deep market research & sizing
   - `competitor_mapper` - Competitive landscape analysis
   - `persona_builder` - Customer persona creation
   - `market_reviewer` - Reviews market perspective docs
   - `revenue_modeler` - Revenue stream design
   - `financial_projector` - Financial projections & forecasts
   - `funding_strategist` - Funding requirements & strategy
   - `finance_reviewer` - Reviews financial docs
   - `technical_architect_bp` - Technical architecture docs
   - `implementation_planner_bp` - Implementation roadmap
   - `feasibility_assessor` - Technical feasibility analysis
   - `technical_reviewer_bp` - Reviews technical docs
   - `operations_designer` - Operations plan
   - `launch_planner` - Go-to-market launch plan
   - `support_designer` - Customer support strategy
   - `operations_reviewer` - Reviews operations docs
   - `legal_analyst` - Legal/regulatory analysis
   - `compliance_mapper` - Compliance requirements
   - `risk_assessor` - Risk assessment & mitigation
   - `legal_reviewer` - Reviews legal docs
   - `executive_synthesizer` - Creates executive summary
   - `timeline_generator` - Creates project timelines
   - `milestone_planner` - Defines milestones
   - `cross_perspective_validator` - Cross-checks all docs
   - `final_integrator_bp` - Final document package

2. **Design the pipeline JSON structure**:
   - Input stage reads the thesis file
   - 5 parallel perspective tracks (market, finance, tech, ops, legal)
   - Each track has 3-4 stages with review loops
   - Review stages can route back for revision or forward for approval
   - Executive summary synthesizes all approved outputs
   - Timeline generation creates chronological documents
   - Final integration validates the complete package

3. **Define routing decisions** for each review agent:
   - `approved` → proceed to next stage
   - `needs_revision` → loop back to drafting stage
   - `major_issues` → loop back with specific feedback
   - `perspective_conflict` → route to cross-perspective validator

4. **Specify explicit document outputs** for each stage:
   - `01-executive-summary.md`
   - `02-market-analysis/market-sizing.md`
   - `02-market-analysis/competitor-landscape.md`
   - `02-market-analysis/customer-personas.md`
   - `03-financial-plan/revenue-model.md`
   - `03-financial-plan/5-year-projections.md`
   - `03-financial-plan/funding-strategy.md`
   - `04-technical-plan/architecture-overview.md`
   - `04-technical-plan/implementation-roadmap.md`
   - `04-technical-plan/technical-feasibility.md`
   - `05-operations-plan/launch-strategy.md`
   - `05-operations-plan/customer-support-plan.md`
   - `05-operations-plan/supply-chain.md`
   - `06-legal-compliance/regulatory-analysis.md`
   - `06-legal-compliance/risk-assessment.md`
   - `06-legal-compliance/compliance-requirements.md`
   - `07-timeline/project-milestones.md`
   - `07-timeline/gantt-chart.md`
   - `07-timeline/quarterly-roadmap.md`

**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Each review loop should be tested by having the reviewer agent actually reject drafts to verify the loop functions
- The cross-perspective validator should catch conflicts (e.g., financial projections not matching technical timeline)
- Edge cases: thesis missing key information should trigger requests for clarification
- Large document handling: ensure agents can handle verbose outputs without truncation

**EVIDENCE:**
- Pipeline JSON file created at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/business-plan-elaborator-v1.json`
- 26+ new agent JSON files created in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/`
- Test run of pipeline generates all expected markdown files
- Review loops demonstrate actual revision cycles in execution logs

**CONFIDENCE:** High - The existing pipeline infrastructure (living-game-world-v1, meta-pipeline-builder-v1) demonstrates proven patterns for complex multi-stage pipelines with review loops. The thesis document provides clear structure for the business plan content.

## Detailed Pipeline Design

```
[thesis_analyzer] → Reads minebox-thesis-refinement.md
                  → Extracts key theses, arguments, evidence needs
                  → Creates foundation document
```

### Phase 2: Market Perspective (with loop)
