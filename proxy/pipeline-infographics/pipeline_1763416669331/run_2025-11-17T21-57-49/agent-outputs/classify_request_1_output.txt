  "reasoning": "While this involves modifying existing radial HUD behavior, it requires implementing NEW functionality: a hover timer system, visual progress indicator, and threshold-based interaction logic. This is not a simple parameter change (QUICK_CHANGE would be just changing a delay value), nor is it fixing broken functionality (BUG_FIX). The request involves adding a new interaction pattern with multiple components (timer logic + visual feedback), which constitutes a feature enhancement to the existing UI system.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The user reports that the radial HUD menu is opening too easily when they move their cursor over the ship. They want to change it to require a hover-and-hold interaction instead - specifically, the user should need to hover over the ship for 0.5 seconds before the radial HUD menu opens, with a visual progress indicator showing the hover progress. Review the current radial HUD opening logic, implement a hover timer system with a 0.5 second threshold, add a visual progress indicator (like a circular fill or bar), and ensure the menu only opens after the full hover duration is met.",

**Analysis:**

This request involves **enhancing the RadialHUD interaction system** with new functionality:

1. **New Timer System**: Implementing hover duration tracking with a 0.5s threshold
2. **New Visual Component**: Adding a progress indicator (circular fill or progress bar)
3. **Modified Interaction Logic**: Changing from immediate-open to delayed-open with state tracking
4. **State Management**: Tracking hover start/end, progress, and cancellation

While it modifies existing code, it's not a simple parameter change—it requires implementing multiple new systems working together, making it a **feature enhancement** rather than a quick change.

**Affected Files (Likely):**
- `js/ui/RadialHUD.js` - Core HUD logic
- `css/radial-hud.css` - Visual indicator styling
- Possibly `js/core/InputManager.js` - Mouse hover event handling
