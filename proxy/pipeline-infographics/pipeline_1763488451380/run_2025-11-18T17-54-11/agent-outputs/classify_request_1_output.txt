  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user has explicitly labeled it 'BUG FIX' and provided detailed error information including: specific error message ('Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)'), exact file location (StationUI.js:1605), function name (autoFitItem), and the call chain (line 1450 double-click handler → autoFitItem). The issue prevents core functionality (fitting items to ships) from working, and the user describes it as 'critical'. This has all the hallmarks of a bug fix: something that should work is broken, there's an error being thrown, and it needs to be fixed.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "BUG FIX: When the user double-clicks an item in their inventory via the ship fitting UI at a station, they get this error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' at StationUI.js:1605 in the autoFitItem function, called from line 1450. The error indicates that when autoFitItem is called from the double-click handler, the ship object is undefined when trying to access ship.hull. This is a critical bug preventing players from fitting items to their ships. Find the root cause of why the ship object is undefined in this context, fix it so double-clicking items properly fits them to the ship, and create a test that verifies the fix works.",
