Now I have a complete picture. Let me provide the assessment.

## Current State

**Client exists:** YES - A 3D game client exists at `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/` using Three.js (not Phaser) with Vite build system.

**Design docs:** The following design documents exist:
- `design-docs/combat-design.md` - Comprehensive combat system design
- `design-docs/henchmen-heroes-design.md` - Complete Guild Wars 1-style companion system
- `design-docs/balance-analysis.md` / `balance-audit.md` - Balance documentation
- `design-docs/progression-design.md` - Character progression
- `design-docs/data-model.md` / `api-specification.md` - Backend specs
- `design-docs/systems-integration.md` / `emergence-analysis.md` - Systems design
- `design-docs/player-experience.md` / `engagement-analysis.md` - UX design

**Backend code:** Substantial backend exists:
- Express/TypeScript API server with PostgreSQL
- WebSocket combat handler
- Services for auth, characters, combat, economy, companions, missions, world
- Full test suite

**Game client code:** Substantial client exists:
- 3D Three.js renderer with third-person camera
- Player, Enemy, Companion entities
- Combat system with damage calculation, skills, validation
- Loot system with visualization
- Party manager for henchmen/heroes with AI decision tree
- UI system (skill bar, health bars, target frame, etc.)
- Input management (WASD, mouse, targeting)

**Can run:** YES - `npm run dev` in client directory starts Vite dev server

## Key Issue Identified

**Companions "just stand there"** because:
1. The AI makes decisions via `CompanionAI.update()` which returns `AIDecision` objects
2. `PartyManager.update()` calls `companion.updateAI()` and gets decisions
3. Decisions with `action === 'SKILL'` are forwarded to `onCompanionDecision` callback
4. **BUT** this callback is never connected to anything that actually executes skills!

The `PartyManager` has `onCompanionDecisionCallback()` for registering a handler, but `Game.ts` never registers one. Companions make AI decisions but nothing executes them.

Additionally missing for "combat working":
- No skill visual effects/animations
- No damage numbers floating up
- Enemy AI doesn't fight back (they have no AI system)
- No companion skill execution
- No companions following/positioning (they have AI but no movement execution)
- No sound effects
- Skill cooldown visuals exist but need enhancement
- Death animations are basic (just rotate)

## Recommendation

The client EXISTS and has a good foundation. The immediate blocker is that **companion AI decisions are not executed** - the wiring is incomplete. This is a feature implementation task, not a setup task.
