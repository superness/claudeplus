Now I have a clear picture. The assessment from the previous stage was correct - companions "just stand there" because the AI decision callback is never wired up to actually execute skills.

## Next Feature: Companion AI Skill Execution

### Already Implemented

- Companion system (henchmen/heroes spawn and appear) ✓
- Companion AI decision-making (makes decisions, generates AIDecision objects) ✓
- PartyManager with `onCompanionDecisionCallback` for receiving decisions ✓

### Why This Feature
The companion AI is sophisticated - it runs a 5-priority decision tree every 0.5 seconds, selects skills based on role (tank/healer/DPS/support/control), evaluates threats, and produces `AIDecision` objects with `action: 'SKILL'`. 

**However, in `Game.ts` lines 184-191**, the party manager is initialized and wired up with player/entity references, but **nobody registers a callback via `partyManager.onCompanionDecisionCallback()`**. The decisions are generated but go nowhere - the wiring to `CombatManager` to actually execute companion skills is missing.

This is exactly what the user described: "henchmen/heroes need help they just stand there."
