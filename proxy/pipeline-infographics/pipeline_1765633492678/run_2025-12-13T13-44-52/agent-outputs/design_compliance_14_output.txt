Based on my comprehensive review of the implementation files and the integration test results from the previous stage, I can now provide the design compliance verdict.

## Design Compliance Check Summary

### ✅ VERIFIED WORKING SYSTEMS

| System | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Enemy AI Fighting Back** | ✅ Connected | EnemyAI.ts with 5 behaviors, EntityManager wires `executeEnemyAIDecision()`, test shows "Player health: 624 → 0" |
| **Companion AI** | ✅ Connected | CompanionAI.ts with 5-priority decision tree, test shows "12 decisions (9 SKILL, 3 MOVE)" |
| **Damage Numbers** | ✅ Working | DamageNumber.ts creates floating text, test shows "Enemy health: 120 → 3 (117 damage dealt!)" |
| **Combat System** | ✅ Connected | CombatSystem.ts with 8 damage types, armor penetration, status effects |
| **Skill Visual Effects** | ✅ Working | SkillVisualEffects.ts creates particle effects, test shows "8 visual effects created" |
| **Health Bars** | ✅ Present | Enemy.ts creates health bar container at line 185-230 |
| **Enemy Threat Tiers** | ✅ Implemented | EnemyTemplates.ts has Minoris/Majoris/Extremis/Terminus/Apex mapping |
| **Faction-based Models** | ✅ Implemented | Enemy.ts has procedural models for IMPERIAL, TAU, ORK, TYRANID, CHAOS |

### Combat Chain Verification

```
Player.useSkill() → CombatManager.handleSkillUse() → CombatSystem.dealDamage() → Enemy.takeDamage()
     ↓                                                                              ↓
Enemy AI update → EntityManager.executeEnemyAIDecision() → onEnemyAttack callback → Player.takeDamage()
     ↓
Companion AI → CompanionAI.makeDecision() → SKILL action → enemy.takeDamage()
```

The integration test results confirm all connections:
- Companions dealt 117 damage to enemies
- Enemy AI killed the player (624 → 0 health)
- 8 visual effects created during combat
- All 7 integration tests passed

### Minor Gaps (Non-blocking)

1. **Sound Effects**: SoundManager referenced but audio files not loaded
2. **Death Animations**: Basic fade-out exists, no skeletal animation
3. **Loot Drops**: LootSystem.ts exists but visual drops not rendered

## DECISION: **matches_design**

The implementation matches the Guild Wars 1-inspired design requirements. All critical combat systems are connected and functional:

- ✅ Enemy AI actively fights back and can kill the player
- ✅ Companion AI makes tactical decisions (9 skill uses, 3 movement actions in test)
- ✅ Damage numbers display during combat
- ✅ Skill visual effects render (8 effects created)
- ✅ Combat chain is fully wired: skills → damage calculation → health reduction
- ✅ Threat tier system (Minoris through Apex) implemented
- ✅ 8 damage types with armor penetration mechanics
- ✅ Status effect system with 18 effect types

The fix_issues stage successfully connected all the previously disconnected systems. The henchmen/heroes no longer "just stand there" - they actively make combat decisions using the 5-priority AI system.
