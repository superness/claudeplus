I have now read both design documents. Let me verify the extracted requirements against the original sources.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

**AI Decision Framework (Lines 607-642) - VERIFIED**
- AI decision interval: 0.5 seconds ✓
- Full 5-step decision tree: Survival → Support → Control → Damage → Positioning ✓
- All health thresholds match: <25% emergency, <50% defensive, <40% heal ally ✓

**Role-Specific AI Behaviors (Lines 646-728) - VERIFIED**
- Tank AI priority (threat maintenance, defensive timing, positioning) ✓
- Healer AI priority (heal order 1-5, condition management, mana management, positioning) ✓
- DPS AI priority (target selection 1-5, burst timing, positioning, safety) ✓
- All specific thresholds extracted correctly ✓

**Behavior Configuration Options (Lines 730-763) - VERIFIED**
- Combat stances: Aggressive (+15%/-15%), Balanced, Defensive (-15%/+15%), Passive ✓
- Target priority dropdown options ✓
- Heal priority options (healers only) ✓
- Position preferences with specific values (Follow Player = 200 range) ✓

**Effectiveness Formula (Lines 900-932) - VERIFIED**
- Henchmen: 70% DPS/healing, 80% survivability, ~90% AI efficiency, ~60% net party value ✓
- Heroes: 90% DPS/healing/survivability, ~95% AI efficiency, ~85% net party value ✓

**Combat Flow from combat-design.md (Lines 22-39) - VERIFIED**
- No auto-attack, 8-skill hotbar, activation times 0.25-3 sec ✓
- Skill queue with 1 action buffer ✓
- No global cooldown (individual skill cooldowns) ✓

**Character-Specific AI Examples - VERIFIED**

- Shas'la Kais: Max range, Markerlight on priority, focus marked, retreats from melee ✓
- Gutsmasha: Always charges melee, prioritizes wounded, survival <40%, never retreats ✓

**Positioning Values - VERIFIED**
- Ranged optimal range: 600-1000 units ✓
- Healer backline: 1000+ from enemies ✓
- Follow player: 200 range ✓

### Minor Notes
- The extraction referenced line numbers that differ slightly from the actual document (the extractor likely had an older version or added/removed lines), but all content is present and accurate
- All key values are correctly captured in the summary table
- The implementation checklist is appropriate for the feature scope

### Ready for Implementation
The requirements capture the design intent faithfully. All specific numeric values, AI decision trees, role behaviors, and effectiveness multipliers match the original design documents. No generic placeholders were substituted for documented specifics.
