  "classification": "FEATURE_REQUEST",
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "reasoning": "This is a request to implement persistent ship fitting functionality. While it mentions a 'previous attempt', the core request is to ADD persistence functionality that saves/restores ship fitting state across page reloads. The user is specifying implementation details (save-on-action vs auto-save intervals), but the fundamental ask is implementing a new feature: state persistence for ship fittings. This is not a bug fix (nothing is broken), not a quick change (requires new logic, storage handling, and restoration logic), and not a refactor (adding new behavior, not improving existing code structure).",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Continue implementing persistent ship fitting between webpage reloads. The previous attempt was stuck trying to use auto-save intervals. Instead, implement a simpler approach: save the ship fitting state immediately whenever the player fits or removes an item from their ship. This means adding save calls directly to the fit/remove action handlers. The save should store which items are fitted to the ship and their positions/slots, and restore this state when the page reloads. Focus on the immediate save-on-action approach rather than periodic auto-saving.",
