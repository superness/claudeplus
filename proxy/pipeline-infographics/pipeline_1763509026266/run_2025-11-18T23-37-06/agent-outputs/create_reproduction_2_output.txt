Perfect! I've created the reproduction script, but I've identified a critical limitation: **the required testing commands don't exist yet in GameTestingInterface.js**.

## Summary

I've created `test_afterburner_mission_bug.js` which attempts to reproduce the afterburner mission bug, but discovered that **we need to implement new commands first**:

### Missing Commands Required:
1. **`startCraftingJob(blueprintId)`** - Start a crafting job
2. **`getCraftingJobs()`** - Check crafting job status
3. **`completeCraftingJob(jobId)`** - Force-complete a job for testing
4. **`getMissionState(missionId)`** - Get mission objective completion status
5. **`getPlayerProgression()`** - Get PlayerProgressionManager statistics (modules_crafted counter)

### Current Script Status:
The script currently only tests the **ship fitting part** by:
1. Docking at a station
2. Cheating an afterburner into inventory (skipping crafting)
3. Fitting the afterburner
4. Verifying it's fitted

**This is incomplete** because the bug is in the **crafting workflow**, specifically the event chain:
```
CraftingManager.completeJob() 
  → fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event 
  → (BROKEN) no listener calls PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted()
  → modules_crafted counter never increments
  → mission objective never completes
```

**DECISION: need_command_implementation**
