Now I have a complete understanding of the bug! Let me create the structured analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "First mission tutorial objective 'Craft and equip your first ship module' (afterburner) does not complete when player crafts and equips the afterburner, blocking new player progression",
  "expectedBehavior": "When the player successfully crafts an afterburner using the CraftingManager and then equips it to their ship using the ShipFittingManager, the PlayerProgressionManager should detect this completion and mark the 'first_crafting' objective (ID: first_crafting) as completed, advancing the tutorial to the next step",
  "actualBehavior": "The crafting and fitting systems work correctly (afterburner is crafted and equipped), but the PlayerProgressionManager's statistics.modules_crafted counter never increments. The objective remains stuck in 'not completed' state because the event chain is broken - CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event but nothing is listening for it to call PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted()",
  "affectedSystems": ["PlayerProgressionManager", "CraftingManager", "ShipFittingManager", "QuantumUniverseIntegration", "SpaceshipSimulator", "Tutorial/Mission system"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Start game and create new player character (capsuleer_cadet phase)",
    "Step 2: Mine resources (tritanium, pyerite, mexallon) required for basic afterburner blueprint",
    "Step 3: Open station UI and use CraftingManager to craft a basic afterburner (blueprint: basic_afterburner_bp)",
    "Step 4: Wait for crafting job to complete (CraftingManager.completeJob fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event)",
    "Step 5: Open ship fitting UI and equip the crafted afterburner to a low slot using ShipFittingManager.fitItem",
    "Step 6: Check PlayerProgressionManager.statistics.modules_crafted - it remains 0 instead of incrementing to 1",
    "Step 7: Check first_crafting objective completion status - remains false, blocking tutorial progression"
  ],

  ],
  "hypothesis": "ROOT CAUSE: Event listener mismatch and missing integration. CraftingManager.completeJob() fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event (line 176) but QuantumUniverseIntegration is listening for 'moduleCrafted' event (line 202). The SpaceshipSimulator (base simulator) doesn't instantiate PlayerProgressionManager or QuantumUniverseIntegration - these are quantum universe systems that aren't properly integrated with the base crafting flow. The tutorial objective tracking system expects PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted() to be called when crafting completes, but this never happens because: 1) Wrong event name ('craftingJobCompleted' vs 'moduleCrafted'), 2) No event listener bridge between CraftingManager and PlayerProgressionManager in the base simulator, 3) QuantumUniverseIntegration exists but isn't instantiated/connected in SpaceshipSimulator. FIX: Either change CraftingManager to fire 'moduleCrafted' event OR add event listener for 'craftingJobCompleted' that calls PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted(), AND ensure PlayerProgressionManager is properly instantiated and connected in SpaceshipSimulator"
}
