UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a `pool_server_manager` agent that manages CoiniumServ mining pool server operations from WSL to Windows. The agent needs to handle launching, monitoring, and shutting down the pool server, plus configuration generation and log parsing. The final deliverable is a complete agent JSON file at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json` based on section 2.1 of `MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.

APPROACH: 
1. First, locate and read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.1 requirements
2. Examine the CoiniumServ codebase structure to locate executables, config files, and understand the directory layout
3. Identify the Windows executable path that needs to be launched from WSL
4. Review existing pool configuration examples to understand config.json structure
5. Design the agent JSON structure with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)
6. Define agent prompts, behaviors, and decision points (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error)
7. Create comprehensive agent specification including error handling and health monitoring logic
8. Write the complete agent JSON file to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use `Glob` to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file: `pattern: "**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md"`
2) Use `Read` to examine section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md for specific requirements
3) Use `Glob` to locate CoiniumServ executable: `pattern: "**/CoiniumServ.exe"` or `pattern: "**/bin/**/*.exe"`
4) Use `Read` to examine existing pool config examples: `build/bin/Debug/config/config.json` and `build/bin/Debug/config/config-example.json`
5) Use `Grep` to search for pool configuration structure: `pattern: "pool"` in config directory
6) Use `Read` to examine existing pool configurations in `build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json`
7) Use `Bash` to test WSL→Windows path conversion: `wslpath -w` command to understand path format
8) Design agent JSON structure with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Available tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
   - System prompt covering all requirements
   - Decision points: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error
   - Instructions for launching via cmd.exe or PowerShell from WSL
   - Log parsing patterns and health check logic
9) Use `Write` to create the complete agent JSON at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json`

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Handle cases where CoiniumServ executable is not found (error decision)
- Handle invalid or missing configuration files (pool_error decision)
- Handle process launch failures from WSL→Windows boundary (pool_error decision)
- Handle pool crashes during monitoring (pool_error decision)
- Validate pool configuration JSON before launching
- Test log parsing with various pool output formats
- Handle graceful shutdown vs force termination scenarios
- Verify process health checks work across WSL/Windows boundary
- Test path conversion between WSL (/mnt/c/...) and Windows (C:\...) formats
- Handle missing log files during monitoring phase

EVIDENCE:
- Raw content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- List of CoiniumServ executable locations found via Glob
- Sample pool configuration JSON structure from existing configs
- Example WSL→Windows command execution pattern
- Complete agent JSON specification showing all required components:
  * Tool permissions array
  * System prompt with all 7 requirements
  * Decision point definitions
  * Error handling logic
  * Configuration generation template
  * Log parsing patterns
  * Health monitoring approach
- Verification that file was written to correct path

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High
- High confidence in understanding requirements (7 clear bullet points provided)
- High confidence in file system exploration (existing CoiniumServ codebase visible in git status)
- Medium confidence in WSL→Windows execution patterns (may need to verify exact command syntax)
- High confidence in JSON agent structure (standard format with tools, prompts, decisions)
- Medium confidence without seeing actual MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 yet (will increase after reading)
- Potential complexity in cross-platform process monitoring might require iteration

DECISION: design_complete
