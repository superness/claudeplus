UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a task plan for building a pool_server_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to manage CoiniumServ pool server operations from WSL to Windows, including launching, monitoring, configuration generation, log parsing, and shutdown capabilities. The final output should be a complete agent JSON file written to a specific path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Locate the CoiniumServ executable in the current repository structure
3. Examine existing pool configuration files to understand the config.json structure
4. Analyze the agent JSON schema/format by looking for existing agent examples in the repository
5. Design the agent with appropriate tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and decision points (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error)
6. Create comprehensive agent instructions covering all required functionalities
7. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1. Use Read tool to read /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract section 2.1 requirements
2. Use Glob tool with pattern "**/CoiniumServ.exe" or "**/CoiniumServ" to locate the executable
3. Use Glob tool with pattern "**/config*.json" in build/bin directories to find existing configuration examples
4. Use Read tool to examine existing config files (build/bin/Debug/config/config.json and build/bin/Debug/config/config-example.json)
5. Use Glob tool to search for existing agent JSON files (pattern "**/*agent*.json" or similar) to understand the agent schema
6. If no agent examples exist, search for agent documentation or schema files
7. Design the agent JSON structure with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Tool permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
   - Decision endpoints: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error
   - Detailed instructions covering:
     * Locating CoiniumServ.exe in Windows path format
     * Generating/validating pool config.json
     * WSL to Windows execution commands (e.g., cmd.exe /c or powershell.exe)
     * Process health monitoring strategies
     * Log file parsing and monitoring
     * Graceful shutdown procedures
8. Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json with the complete agent definition
9. Use Read tool to verify the written file is valid JSON and complete

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Test with CoiniumServ executable located in different directories (Debug/Release builds)
- Handle missing executable scenarios (error decision)
- Validate config.json generation with required pool parameters
- Test WSL→Windows execution with different command formats (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, .exe direct)
- Monitor process health with missing/inaccessible log files
- Test log parsing with various log formats and error messages
- Handle shutdown scenarios: graceful termination, force kill, already stopped
- Verify error handling for permission issues crossing WSL/Windows boundary
- Test with pool server already running (detect and handle)
- Validate configuration file write permissions in Windows directories from WSL

EVIDENCE:
- Show the content of section 2.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Display the located CoiniumServ executable path
- Show example config.json structure from existing files
- Provide the complete agent JSON structure with all required fields
- Display the final written agent file content
- Show validation that the JSON is properly formatted
- Include specific bash commands for WSL→Windows execution (e.g., "/mnt/c/path/to/CoiniumServ.exe" or "cmd.exe /c 'C:\path\to\CoiniumServ.exe'")
- Document the log file paths and parsing patterns
- Show process monitoring commands (e.g., ps, tasklist.exe via WSL)

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High
- High confidence in reading documentation and creating JSON structure
- Medium-high confidence in WSL→Windows execution patterns (may need to verify exact command syntax)
- High confidence in file manipulation and configuration generation
- Medium confidence in agent schema (depends on finding existing examples or documentation)
- The main uncertainty is the exact agent JSON schema format used by the claudeplus system, but can infer from common patterns

[DECISION: design_complete]
