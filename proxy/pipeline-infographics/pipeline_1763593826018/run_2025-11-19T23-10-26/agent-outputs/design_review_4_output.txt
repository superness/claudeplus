ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates good comprehension of the task - creating a pool_server_manager agent JSON file that manages CoiniumServ from WSL→Windows
2. **Logical Sequence**: The approach follows a sensible order: read specs → locate files → examine configs → design agent → write JSON → verify
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses all stated requirements (locate, configure, launch, monitor, parse logs, shutdown)
4. **Good Test Considerations**: Shows thoughtful error handling scenarios (executable not found, already running, timeout handling)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Missing Critical Evidence**: The plan doesn't specify WHAT EXACTLY will be shown to prove the agent JSON is correct and complete. "Will provide the complete agent JSON file content" is vague - what validates correctness?
2. **No Validation Strategy**: How will the agent JSON be validated against the actual agent schema/format? No mention of checking against existing agent examples or schema files
3. **Insufficient Spec Reading**: The plan will read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md but doesn't commit to showing how the implementation maps to section 2.1 requirements point-by-point
4. **WSL→Windows Execution Uncertainty**: The "medium confidence" on WSL→Windows specifics is concerning - this is a core requirement. The plan should include finding examples or documentation
5. **No Agent Schema Discovery**: Doesn't mention finding/examining existing agent JSON files to understand the required structure/format
6. **Vague "Complete Agent JSON"**: What makes the agent JSON "complete"? Need specific criteria

**Critical Gaps:**
- No step to examine existing agent JSON files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` to understand the required schema
- No verification against section 2.1's specific requirements as a checklist
- No concrete success criteria for what "complete and correct" means
- Missing proof that all decisions (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error) are properly defined in the JSON
- No validation that the JSON is syntactically correct and follows the agent framework schema

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence lacks specificity:
- "Will show example pool configuration structure" - but how does this prove the agent JSON is correct?
- "Will provide the complete agent JSON file content" - this is the deliverable, not evidence of correctness
- "Will verify JSON file was written successfully" - writing ≠ correctness
- Missing: Specific validation against agent schema, point-by-point mapping to section 2.1 requirements, comparison with existing working agents

**What's Missing for Strong Evidence:**
1. Example of existing agent JSON for format reference
2. Line-by-line mapping showing section 2.1 requirements → agent JSON implementation
3. Schema validation or comparison against agent framework requirements
4. Demonstration that all 4 decisions are properly triggered by appropriate conditions
5. Proof that WSL→Windows execution commands are correctly formatted

DECISION: REJECTED (Design needs revision - must include agent schema discovery, explicit validation criteria, and concrete proof of completeness against section 2.1 requirements)
