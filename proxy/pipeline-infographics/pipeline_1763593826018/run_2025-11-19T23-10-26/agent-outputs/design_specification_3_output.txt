UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool_server_manager agent that can manage CoiniumServ (a cryptocurrency mining pool server) from WSL to Windows. The agent needs to handle launching, monitoring, and managing the pool server based on specifications in section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The final deliverable is a complete agent JSON file at the specified path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Locate the CoiniumServ executable in the repository structure
3. Examine existing pool configuration files to understand the config structure
4. Design the agent JSON with appropriate prompts, tools, and decision points
5. Create steps for each requirement: locating executable, generating config, launching via WSL→Windows, monitoring health, parsing logs, and shutdown
6. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and understand section 2.1 requirements
2) Use Glob tool to find CoiniumServ executable with pattern "**/CoiniumServ*.exe"
3) Use Read tool to examine existing pool configuration files in build/bin/Debug/config/ and build/bin/Release/config/ directories
4) Use Glob tool to find example pool configurations with pattern "**/config/pools/*.json"
5) Use Read tool to examine example pool configurations to understand required structure
6) Design agent JSON structure with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - System prompt detailing WSL→Windows execution requirements
   - Tool permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
   - Decision definitions: pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error
   - Task instructions for each requirement (locate, configure, launch, monitor, parse logs, shutdown)
   - Example commands for WSL→Windows execution (e.g., `/mnt/c/path/to/CoiniumServ.exe`)
   - Health monitoring strategy (process checks, log parsing)
   - Error handling procedures
7) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/pool_server_manager.json with the complete agent specification
8) Use Read tool to verify the written JSON is valid and complete

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will design agent to handle case where CoiniumServ executable is not found (error decision)
- Will include validation for config.json generation (check required fields exist)
- Will design WSL→Windows path translation handling (/mnt/c/ prefix)
- Will include process verification after launch (check if process is running)
- Will design log parsing to detect common error patterns (connection failures, configuration errors)
- Will include graceful shutdown with timeout handling
- Will handle cases where pool is already running or already stopped
- Will validate that all required configuration parameters are present before launch

EVIDENCE:
- Will collect the actual section 2.1 content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will provide the located CoiniumServ executable path(s)
- Will show example pool configuration structure from existing files
- Will provide the complete agent JSON file content
- Will verify JSON file was written successfully to the specified path
- Will document the WSL→Windows execution command format discovered
- Will list all decision points and their trigger conditions

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High 
- High confidence in creating agent JSON structure based on standard agent format
- High confidence in locating CoiniumServ files given the git status shows extensive config files
- Medium confidence on WSL→Windows execution specifics without seeing the actual documentation
- Need to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand exact requirements for section 2.1
- The repository structure is clear from git status, showing both Debug and Release builds

DECISION: design_complete
