ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear understanding demonstrated**: The plan shows comprehension of the task - building a pool_server_manager agent that handles CoiniumServ operations across WSL/Windows boundary
2. **Logical step progression**: The approach follows a sensible sequence: read requirements → explore codebase → locate executables → examine configs → design agent → write JSON
3. **Comprehensive scope coverage**: All 7 requirements are explicitly acknowledged (launch, locate executable, generate config, WSL→Windows exec, monitor health, parse logs, shutdown)
4. **Thorough test considerations**: Excellent anticipation of failure modes (missing executable, invalid configs, launch failures, crashes, path conversion issues)
5. **Tool usage matches permissions**: Only uses allowed tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)
6. **Decision points properly mapped**: All 4 required decisions identified (pool_started, pool_stopped, pool_error, error)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague evidence specification for agent JSON**: The plan says it will show "all required components" but doesn't specify what concrete structure will be verified. What exact JSON schema? What specific fields?
2. **Missing verification step**: No step to validate the written JSON is parseable/well-formed
3. **Circular dependency**: Step 8 says "Design agent JSON structure" but this is mental planning, not verifiable evidence gathering
4. **WSL→Windows execution testing is speculative**: Step 7 mentions testing `wslpath -w` but doesn't commit to capturing actual command output as evidence
5. **Log parsing patterns undefined**: The plan mentions this will be included but provides no indication of what patterns will be used or how they'll be derived
6. **No validation of section 2.1 alignment**: After reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, there's no step to confirm the design matches those requirements before writing JSON

**Critical Gaps:**
- **EVIDENCE GAP**: The final deliverable is a JSON file, but there's no step saying "Read back the written JSON to verify completeness" or "Show the JSON contains X, Y, Z required fields"
- **SPECIFICATION GAP**: What exactly makes an agent JSON "complete"? The plan doesn't reference any schema or template
- **PROOF GAP**: How will we know the agent JSON actually implements all 7 requirements? Just saying it has "system prompt with all 7 requirements" is not concrete evidence

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The evidence list includes:
- ✅ Raw content from plan document (concrete)
- ✅ Executable locations (concrete)
- ✅ Sample config structure (concrete)
- ⚠️ "Example WSL→Windows command execution pattern" (vague - what pattern exactly?)
- ❌ "Complete agent JSON specification showing all required components" (this is the deliverable, not evidence of correctness)
- ❌ "Verification that file was written to correct path" (just proves file existence, not correctness)

**Missing concrete evidence:**
- No sample of the actual system prompt text to verify it covers all requirements
- No specification of health check implementation details
- No log parsing regex or search patterns
- No example of a test launch command
- No validation that the JSON is syntactically correct
- No comparison checklist: "Requirement 1: Launch CoiniumServ ✓ - implemented in JSON line X"

DECISION: **REJECTED**

**Specific reasoning:**
While the plan demonstrates good understanding of the task and has a logical approach, it **fails the evidence standard** for a complex deliverable like this. The plan treats "writing the JSON" as the final step, but provides no concrete mechanism to verify that the written JSON actually fulfills all requirements. 

The evidence section essentially says "I will write a complete JSON and verify it was written" - but **existence ≠ correctness**. For approval, the plan needs:

1. **Concrete JSON schema**: Define what fields/structure the agent JSON must have
2. **Requirement mapping**: Explicit checklist showing how each of 7 requirements maps to specific JSON elements
3. **Validation step**: Read back and verify the JSON against requirements
4. **Sample outputs**: Show actual command patterns, log parsing regexes, config templates that will be embedded
5. **Proof mechanism**: How will you demonstrate the agent can actually launch CoiniumServ from WSL? Just writing JSON isn't proof it works.

The medium-high confidence is unjustified given these evidence gaps. The plan needs revision to include concrete verification steps and clearer success criteria.

DECISION: REJECTED (Design rejected, needs revision)
