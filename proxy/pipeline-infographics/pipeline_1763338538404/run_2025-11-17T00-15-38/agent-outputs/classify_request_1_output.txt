  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'critical bug that needs to be debugged and fixed'. The ship movement system is not working as expected - the ship is not responding to navigation targets or tap/click commands. This is broken core functionality that requires investigation and repair.",

    "originalRequest": "The player ship is not moving at all, even after setting navigation targets and tapping places to fly to in space. This is a critical bug that needs to be debugged and fixed. Investigate the ship movement system, navigation target handling, and input processing to identify why the ship isn't responding to movement commands. Find the root cause and implement a fix to restore ship movement functionality.",
