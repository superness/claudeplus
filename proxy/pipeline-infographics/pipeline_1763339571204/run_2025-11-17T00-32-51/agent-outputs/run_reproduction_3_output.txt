I found the issue! Looking at lines 174-178, the automation server forwards ALL messages from the game client to the test client without any filtering. This means when the game sends a message with `type: 'response'`, the test client receives the entire wrapper object `{type: 'response', response: {...}}` instead of just the response content.

The test client's `handleGameResponse` function expects just the response object with `success`, `data`, `error` fields, but it's getting the wrapper.

This is a FRAMEWORK_ERROR - the WebSocket message routing in the automation server is not correctly unwrapping response messages. The fix would be to modify the server to extract the `response` field when forwarding messages of type 'response'.

However, since I'm executing as a Game Runner and should only report facts, let me document this execution result:

## Execution Report

**Status**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR detected

**Observable Facts**:
1. ✓ Dev server running on http://localhost:8080
2. ✓ WebSocket server started successfully on port 8765
3. ✓ Game connected to automation server
4. ✓ Test client connected successfully
5. ✗ Command execution failed with "Unknown error"

**Evidence Captured**:
- File: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763340086344.json`
- Command sent: `getShipState` with id "1"
- Response received: `{type: "command", command: {id: "1", command: "getShipState", params: {}}}`
- Status: COMMAND_FAILED

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The automation server (lines 174-178 in `reproduce_ship_movement_bug_fixed.js`) forwards raw messages between game and test clients without unwrapping response wrappers. When the game sends `{type: 'response', response: {...}}`, the test client receives this entire structure instead of just the response content. The test client's handler then fails because it expects fields like `success`, `data`, `error` at the top level, not wrapped in a `response` field.

**Infrastructure Issue**:
The WebSocket message routing logic in the automation server does not properly handle the message format mismatch between:
- Browser→Server: `{type: 'response', response: {id, success, data, error, ...}}`
- Expected by test client: `{id, success, data, error, ...}`

**Ship Movement Fix Status**:
Cannot verify - test infrastructure prevented execution of movement verification logic.

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
