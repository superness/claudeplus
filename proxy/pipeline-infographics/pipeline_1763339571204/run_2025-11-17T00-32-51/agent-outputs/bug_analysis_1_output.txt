I'll analyze this ship movement bug systematically.

## Bug Analysis

Based on the user report and codebase context, here's my structured analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship completely unresponsive to navigation commands and tap/click inputs - no movement occurs despite setting navigation targets",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player sets navigation target (via UI, tapping/clicking in space, or double-tap gesture), ship should accelerate toward target using EVE-style physics, with visible velocity changes and position updates",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary at current position. Navigation targets may be set internally but produce no physics response or movement. No acceleration, no velocity change, no position updates visible",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "ship movement",
    "physics engine",
    "input handling",
    "navigation system",
    "touch/mobile input",
    "game loop integration"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in a web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and player ship to spawn",
    "Step 3: Attempt to set navigation target via double-tap/double-click on empty space",
    "Step 4: Alternatively, select a target object (asteroid, station) and use 'Navigate To' command",
    "Step 5: Observe ship behavior - ship should accelerate but remains stationary",
    "Step 6: Open browser DevTools console and check for errors or physics-related logs",
    "Step 7: Check ship velocity in debug overlay (F1) - likely shows zero velocity despite target being set"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/NavigationManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/EVEPhysics.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Multiple potential root causes: (1) Physics update loop not being called or physics timestep issue in game loop, (2) Ship navigation target not being properly set from input handlers, (3) ShipPhysics.updateVelocity() not applying acceleration calculations, (4) Ship entity not connected to physics engine, (5) Input event handlers not triggering navigation commands, (6) Recent modifications to Ship.js/ShipPhysics.js/InputManager.js may have broken integration points. Git status shows these files are modified - likely a recent change introduced the regression.",
  "additionalContext": {
    "evidenceFiles": [
      "ship_movement_bug_evidence_*.json files suggest previous debugging attempts",
      "SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md may contain prior investigation notes"
    ],
    "modifiedFiles": [
      "Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js all show 'M' status in git",
      "Recent commits include WebSocket automation, ship fitting fixes",
      "Possible integration issue from recent changes"
    ],
    "debuggingApproach": [
      "Read SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md for prior investigation results",
      "Examine recent changes in Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js",
      "Check if physics update is being called in game loop",
      "Verify navigation target is being set correctly from input",
      "Test if manual ship.setNavigationTarget() works in console",
      "Add console logging to trace execution path from input → navigation → physics → movement"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next Investigation Steps

1. **Read existing bug documentation** - Check `SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` and recent evidence JSON files
2. **Examine git diff** - Review recent changes to Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js that may have introduced regression
3. **Test physics integration** - Verify game loop is calling physics update at 60Hz
4. **Trace execution path** - Add logging from input → setNavigationTarget() → updateVelocity() → position update
5. **Browser console testing** - Manually call movement functions to isolate which layer is broken
