## Next Feature: Better UX for Selection and Move Feedback

### Already Implemented
- Click-to-select piece selection (InputSystem lines 427-465)
- Yellow highlight on selected piece tile (RenderingSystem lines 519-529)
- Green highlights on valid move destinations (RenderingSystem lines 532-542)
- Basic turn indicator showing whose turn it is
- Status messages for "You must capture!" and "Multi-jump!"

### From Design Docs
The design doc (Input System, section 8) specifies:
- Click to select piece (must be current player's piece)
- Click destination to move (if valid)
- Highlight valid moves for selected piece
- Enforce mandatory captures (only show jumps if available)

The Rendering System (section 9) specifies:
- `selectedColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)'` for selected piece
- `highlightColor: 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4)'` for valid moves
- "Display current player indicator and captured piece counts"

### Why This Feature Next

The user explicitly reported UX confusion as a pain point:
1. "I have to click a unit but there is no indication it is selected" - The yellow highlight exists but is subtle (just the tile, not the piece itself)
2. "Then I have to click a square to move to instead of like dragging it" - Click-to-move is functional but unintuitive
3. "Green highlights appear that I don't understand" - No explanation or visual context for valid moves

**This is more urgent than AI opponent** because:
- Players can't even effectively play the game if they don't understand how to interact with it
- Core mechanic clarity comes before adding opponents
- UX improvements affect every single move; AI only matters for single-player mode

The AI opponent can wait - if human players can't understand how to make moves, they'll never get to play against an AI anyway.
