Now I have all the code. Let me trace the integration paths for both features:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - The JavaScript code is syntactically correct with no obvious errors. All classes are properly closed, all functions have matching braces.

### Integration Path Verification

#### Feature 1: AI Opponent

**Entry point:** `GameController.executeMove()` line 1168 → calls `scheduleAIMove()` line 1226

**Path traced:**
1. ✅ `AISystem` class defined at line 844
2. ✅ `AISystem` instantiated in `GameController.initSystems()` at line 1119: `this.aiSystem = new AISystem(this.pieceSystem, this.movementSystem, this.captureSystem, this.board);`
3. ✅ `isAIEnabled` flag set to `true` at line 1104: `this.isAIEnabled = true;`
4. ✅ After player move, `executeMove()` checks at line 1211: `if (this.isAIEnabled && this.turnSystem.currentPlayer === 'black')`
5. ✅ Calls `this.scheduleAIMove()` which sets a 500ms timeout then calls `executeAIMove()`
6. ✅ `executeAIMove()` at line 1237 calls `this.aiSystem.chooseBestMove()` 
7. ✅ `chooseBestMove()` at line 1050 returns a move object
8. ✅ Move is executed with `this.board.movePiece()` and captured pieces removed
9. ✅ Multi-jump logic handled at lines 1258-1265, recursively calls `executeAIMove()`
10. ✅ AI turn ends by calling `this.turnSystem.endTurn()` at line 1285

**CONNECTED: YES** - Full AI integration path is complete and functional.

#### Feature 2: Drag-and-Drop UX

**Entry point:** `InputSystem.handleMouseDown()` line 459

**Path traced:**
1. ✅ `InputSystem` class has drag state variables at lines 424-430: `isDragging`, `dragPiece`, `dragOffsetX/Y`, `dragX/Y`
2. ✅ Event listeners bound in constructor lines 433-441: `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `mouseleave`, plus touch events
3. ✅ `handleMouseDown()` starts drag at line 476: `this.isDragging = true; this.dragPiece = clickedPiece;`
4. ✅ `handleMouseMove()` updates drag position at lines 495-502 and calls `this.onDragUpdate()`
5. ✅ `onDragUpdate` callback set in `GameController.initSystems()` at lines 1135-1137 to trigger re-render
6. ✅ `handleMouseUp()` at line 520 checks for valid drop target and calls `this.onMoveCallback(targetMove)`
7. ✅ `RenderingSystem.drawDraggingPiece()` at line 714 renders dragging piece at cursor position
8. ✅ `RenderingSystem.drawPieces()` at line 703 skips rendering piece at original position while dragging
9. ✅ Selected piece shows yellow pulsing glow (lines 762-780) with animation
10. ✅ Valid move targets highlighted in green (lines 691-700) using `CONFIG.highlightColor`

**CONNECTED: YES** - Full drag-and-drop path is connected and functional.

#### Feature 3: UX Instructions Update

**Path traced:**
1. ✅ Instructions in `index.html` updated at lines 42-53
2. ✅ "Drag your pieces to move them" (line 44) - reflects drag-drop interaction
3. ✅ "Green squares = valid drop targets" (line 48) - explains green highlights  
4. ✅ "You play Red, AI plays Black" (line 52) - explains AI opponent
5. ✅ CSS for `.ai-icon` added at lines 176-180 in style.css

**CONNECTED: YES** - Instructions match the implemented behavior.

### Disconnected Systems Found
None. All systems are properly instantiated and connected:
- `AISystem` → instantiated in `GameController.initSystems()` 
- `InputSystem` drag handlers → connected to canvas events
- `RenderingSystem` → receives drag state updates via callback

### Placeholder Code Found
None. No TODO, FIXME, or stub code found in the game logic.

### Issues Found
None. All integration paths are fully connected and working.

**Summary:**
1. **AI System**: Fully integrated. `AISystem` is instantiated, connected to game systems, and called on black's turn. Uses minimax algorithm with difficulty settings.
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Fully integrated. Mouse/touch events → drag state → move execution → rendering all connected.
3. **Visual Feedback**: Selected piece shows pulsing yellow glow. Valid moves show green highlights. Dragging piece follows cursor with drop shadow.
4. **Instructions**: Updated to explain all UX elements correctly.
