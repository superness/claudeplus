## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - `client/index.html`, `client/game.js`, `client/style.css`
- **Design docs**: `design-docs/game-design.md` - comprehensive American Checkers design document with 9 systems fully documented
- **Backend code**: None needed - this is a pure client-side browser game using HTML5 Canvas
- **Can run**: Yes - `npm start` runs on port 3000 via serve

### Current Game Implementation
The game has a fully working implementation with:
- 8x8 board rendering (BoardSystem)
- Piece management with red/black pieces (PieceSystem) 
- Movement validation (MovementSystem)
- Capture/jump logic with mandatory captures (CaptureSystem)
- Turn management with multi-jump support (TurnSystem)
- King promotion (KingPromotionSystem)
- Win condition detection (WinConditionSystem)
- Click-to-select input handling (InputSystem)
- Canvas-based rendering (RenderingSystem)

### UX Issues Identified (from user feedback):
1. **No selection indicator**: Clicking a unit provides no visual feedback that it's selected
2. **Click-to-move is confusing**: Users expect drag-and-drop instead of click-select-then-click-destination
3. **Green highlights are confusing**: Valid move squares show green highlights but there's no explanation of what they mean

## Recommendation

The game client is complete and functional. We can proceed to implement the requested features:
1. **AI opponent** - Add computer player that can play as black
2. **Better UX for playing**:
   - Visual selection indicator (glow, outline, animation)
   - Consider drag-and-drop as alternative to click-to-move
   - Add tutorial/hints explaining the green highlights = valid moves
   - Better cursor feedback
