## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Outdated instructions - "Click a piece to select it"
- File: `client/index.html`
- Fix: Changed instruction text from "Click a piece to select it" to "Drag your pieces to move them" to reflect the new drag-and-drop interaction model

### Issue 2: Confusing green highlights explanation
- File: `client/index.html`
- Fix: Changed "Green = valid moves (click to move)" to "Green squares = valid drop targets" to clarify that users should drag to these squares

### Issue 3: No indication user plays against AI
- File: `client/index.html`
- Fix: Added a third instruction row: "You play Red, AI plays Black" to make it clear the user controls Red pieces and the AI controls Black

### Issue 4: Missing CSS for AI icon
- File: `client/style.css`
- Fix: Added `.instruction-icon.ai-icon` style with a black circular icon to represent the AI opponent
