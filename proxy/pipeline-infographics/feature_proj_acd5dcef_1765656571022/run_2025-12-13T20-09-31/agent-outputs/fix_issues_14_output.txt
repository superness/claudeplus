## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Tests used click-click interaction instead of drag-and-drop
- File: `/client/tests/checkers.spec.js`
- Fix: Added a `dragMove` helper function that simulates mouse drag gestures using `page.mouse.move()`, `page.mouse.down()`, `page.mouse.move()`, and `page.mouse.up()`. Updated all test cases that previously used double-click to select and move pieces.

### Issue 2: Tests expected manual Black moves but AI now controls Black
- File: `/client/tests/checkers.spec.js`
- Fix: Updated all tests to wait for AI moves (1000ms timeout) after each Red player move. Changed assertions to expect "Red's Turn" after AI completes its move instead of expecting to control Black pieces manually. Renamed "Game plays multiple turns" test to "Game plays multiple turns with AI".

### Issue 3: Visual validation tests also used click-click interaction
- File: `/client/tests/visual-validation.spec.js`
- Fix: Added the same `dragMove` helper function and updated all visual tests to use drag-and-drop. Updated checklists to reflect AI opponent behavior (Black moves automatically).

### Issue 4: Test 04 tried to select Black pieces (now controlled by AI)
- File: `/client/tests/visual-validation.spec.js`
- Fix: Replaced "04-black-piece-selection" test with "04-multiple-turns-with-ai" that verifies multiple Red moves and AI responses work correctly.
