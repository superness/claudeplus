Now I have a complete picture. Let me review the implementation and provide the validation.

## Feature Complete: AI Opponent + Improved UX (Drag-and-Drop & Visual Feedback)

### What Was Built

Based on the compliance check from the previous stage:

1. **AI Opponent System** (`game.js:844-1098`)
   - Complete `AISystem` class with minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning
   - `chooseBestMove()` - main entry point for AI decisions
   - `getAllMoves()`, `evaluateBoard()`, `evaluateMove()` - strategic evaluation
   - AI plays Black pieces automatically after human (Red) moves
   - Handles multi-jump sequences

2. **Drag-and-Drop UX** (`game.js:415-624`)
   - Full `InputSystem` with mouse handlers: `handleMouseDown()`, `handleMouseMove()`, `handleMouseUp()`
   - Touch support: `handleTouchStart/Move/End()` for mobile devices
   - Visual drag feedback: enlarged piece (1.1x), drop shadow, gold border during drag

3. **Visual Feedback System**
   - Selected piece: pulsing yellow glow animation (`RenderingSystem.drawPiece()` lines 759-780)
   - Valid move indicators: green highlighted squares (`RenderingSystem.drawHighlights()` line 676)
   - Instructions panel in HTML explaining controls and what colors mean

### Files Created/Modified
- `client/game.js` - Main game logic with AI, Input, and Rendering systems
- `client/index.html` - Game canvas and instructions panel
- `client/style.css` - Styling

### Verified Working
The design compliance check confirmed:
- All systems connected and functional
- Color palette matches design doc exactly (light: #FFCE9E, dark: #D18B47, etc.)
- AI integration path verified through GameController → scheduleAIMove → executeAIMove → AISystem
- Drag-and-drop working with visual feedback
- Instructions panel explains the UI

### Next Steps

Comparing against the USER'S ORIGINAL REQUEST and design documents:

**User's Original Game Idea**: American Checkers (8x8 board game)

**Design Document Requirements Met:**
- ✅ 8x8 board with proper layout
- ✅ 12 pieces per player, correct starting positions
- ✅ Mandatory capture rule
- ✅ Multi-jump continuation
- ✅ King promotion system
- ✅ Win condition detection
- ✅ Turn system
- ✅ Rendering with proper colors

**User's Feature Requests (addressed in this implementation):**
- ✅ AI opponent (plays Black automatically)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop UX (no more confusing click-to-select then click-to-move)
- ✅ Clear visual feedback (yellow pulsing for selection, green for valid moves)
- ✅ Instructions panel explaining the UI

**Is the game complete?**
This is a fully playable American Checkers game with:
- All core mechanics from the design document implemented
- Single-player mode against AI
- Intuitive drag-and-drop controls
- Clear visual indicators

The game fulfills the user's vision of American Checkers and addresses all three concerns raised in their latest feedback. It is playable and complete for its genre as a classic board game.
