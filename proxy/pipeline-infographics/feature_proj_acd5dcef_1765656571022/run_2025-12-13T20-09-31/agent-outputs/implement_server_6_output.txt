There is no backend server for this game project - it's a purely client-side checkers game. The AI opponent mentioned by the user can be implemented entirely in the client-side JavaScript without needing any server code.

The previous stage incorrectly marked this as `needs_backend`, but an AI opponent for checkers doesn't require server code - it's a simple evaluation algorithm that can run entirely in the browser.

## Server Changes

None required - this is a client-only feature.

The AI opponent for a checkers game can be implemented entirely in client-side JavaScript. Checkers AI uses:
1. Move evaluation (counting material, position, kings)
2. Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (optional for stronger AI)
3. Simple random/greedy selection for basic AI

All of this logic can run in the browser without any server communication. The game already has:
- `TurnSystem.getValidMoves()` - returns all valid moves for current player
- `CaptureSystem.getAllJumpsForPlayer()` - returns all jump moves
- `MovementSystem.getValidMoves()` - returns all regular moves
- `PieceSystem.getPiecesForPlayer()` - returns pieces by player

An AI opponent would simply:
1. Wait for black's turn (or the AI-controlled player)
2. Get all valid moves using existing systems
3. Evaluate each move using a scoring function
4. Execute the best move

This is purely client-side game logic, not a server feature.
