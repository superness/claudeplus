## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - The game.js file uses valid JavaScript syntax with proper IIFE structure, class definitions, and method implementations.

### Integration Path Verification

#### Feature 1: AI Opponent
- Entry point: **DOES NOT EXIST**
- There is NO AISystem, AIOpponent, or any AI-related class in the codebase
- No code searches for AI, aiMove, or opponent logic
- **CONNECTED: NO**

**CRITICAL**: The AI opponent feature was NOT implemented. The previous stage (`implement_server`) correctly noted that AI could be implemented client-side but stated "implementation_complete" without actually implementing it.

#### Feature 2: Better UX - Selection Indicators
- Entry point: `InputSystem.selectPiece()` → sets `selectedPiece` and `highlightedMoves`
- Calls: `RenderingSystem.drawPiece()` checks `isSelected` and draws:
  - Pulsing yellow glow effect (lines 573-591)
  - Thicker yellow border (lines 606-608)
- Reaches target: **YES** - Selected pieces get visual feedback
- **CONNECTED: YES** ✓

The selection indicator IS implemented and working. Yellow glow + border appears on selected piece.

#### Feature 3: Better UX - Drag and Drop
- Entry point: **DOES NOT EXIST**
- No `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mousemove`, or `drag` event handlers
- Only `click` events are handled
- **CONNECTED: NO**

**CRITICAL**: No drag-and-drop was implemented. The user explicitly requested "dragging" instead of click-click, but no drag functionality exists.

#### Feature 4: Better UX - Highlight Explanations  
- Entry point: Instructions in `index.html` lines 41-50
- Visual: Legend shows yellow = selected, green = valid moves
- CSS: `#instructions` styled with `.instruction-icon.selected-icon` (yellow) and `.instruction-icon.move-icon` (green)
- **CONNECTED: YES** ✓

The highlight explanations ARE implemented. An instruction panel explains what yellow and green highlights mean.

### Disconnected Systems Found
1. **AI System** - Completely missing. No class exists, nothing to be disconnected.
2. **Drag/Drop System** - Completely missing. No drag event handlers exist.

### Placeholder Code Found
None detected - but that's because the features were simply never created.

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**

1. **AI Opponent NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Zero AI code exists. No AISystem class, no move evaluation, no minimax, no random selection - absolutely nothing. The previous stage claimed "implementation_complete" but only explained *how* AI could be implemented without actually doing it.

2. **Drag-and-Drop NOT IMPLEMENTED** - No drag functionality exists. Users still must click piece, then click destination. The user's explicit complaint about "clicking a unit but there is no indication it is selected then I have to click a square to move to instead of like dragging it" was only half-addressed (selection is now visible, but no dragging).

**WORKING FEATURES:**

1. ✓ Selection Indicators - Pulsing yellow glow with thick border shows selected piece
2. ✓ Highlight Explanations - Instructions panel explains green = valid moves, yellow = selected
