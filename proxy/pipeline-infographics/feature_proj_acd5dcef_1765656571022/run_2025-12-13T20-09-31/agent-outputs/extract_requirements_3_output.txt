## Feature: Better UX for Selection and Move Feedback

### Specifications from Design Docs

#### Input System (Section 8)

From game-design.md lines 289-323:

> - **Purpose**: Handle player input for piece selection and move execution
> - **Core Mechanics**:
>   - Click to select piece (must be current player's piece)
>   - Click destination to move (if valid)
>   - Highlight valid moves for selected piece
>   - Enforce mandatory captures (only show jumps if available)

```javascript
InputState: {
  selectedPiece: Piece | null,
  highlightedMoves: Move[],
  lastClickedTile: {x, y} | null
}
```

#### Rendering System (Section 9)

From game-design.md lines 329-355:

> - **Purpose**: Display board state and visual feedback
> - **Core Mechanics**:
>   - Highlight selected piece and valid move destinations
>   - Display current player indicator and captured piece counts

```javascript
RenderConfig: {
  highlightColor: 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4)',
  selectedColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)'
}
```

#### Color Palette

From game-design.md lines 434-435:

> | Valid move highlight | rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4) |
> | Selected piece highlight | rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5) |

### Design Documentation Status: PARTIAL

The design docs specify:
- ✅ Click-to-select interaction model
- ✅ Click-to-move interaction model  
- ✅ Highlight colors for selection (yellow 50% opacity) and valid moves (green 40% opacity)
- ✅ "Highlight selected piece" requirement
- ✅ "Highlight valid move destinations" requirement

The design docs do **NOT** specify:
- ❌ How to visually indicate selection on the piece itself (currently only tile is highlighted)
- ❌ Any hover effects or cursor changes
- ❌ Drag-and-drop as an alternative interaction
- ❌ Tooltips, instructions, or onboarding text
- ❌ Visual explanation of what green highlights mean
- ❌ Any animation or transition effects

### User Complaints vs Current Implementation

| User Complaint | Design Doc Spec | Gap |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| "No indication piece is selected" | `selectedColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)'` on tile | Spec only covers tile, not piece visual |
| "Click to move confusing" | "Click destination to move" | No alternative (drag) specified |
| "Green highlights I don't understand" | `highlightColor: 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4)'` | No explanatory UI specified |

### What Needs to Be Designed

The design doc establishes the basic interaction model (click-select, click-move, highlights) but lacks UX polish specifications for:

1. **Piece-level selection indicator** - How should the selected piece itself look different? (border, glow, scale, animation?)
2. **Interaction affordances** - Should there be hover effects? Cursor changes? Drag support?
3. **Instructional UI** - Should there be help text, tooltips, or a tutorial explaining controls?
4. **Move destination clarity** - Should green highlights have additional indicators (icons, arrows, labels)?

### Related Systems in Docs

The existing specs provide foundation:
- Input System: Click interaction pattern defined
- Rendering System: Highlight colors defined
- Turn System: Multi-jump state tracking exists for UI context

### Recommendation

Since the user is experiencing UX confusion with an implemented system that technically matches the design doc, this is a case where the design doc is **underspecified** for good UX rather than completely missing. 

The feature can be enhanced within the spirit of the existing spec by:
1. Making the piece itself more visually prominent when selected (not just the tile)
2. Adding hover cursor changes for interactive elements
3. Adding a brief instruction or legend explaining the color meanings

These are reasonable UX enhancements that don't contradict the design doc but fill gaps in its specification.

### Implementation Checklist

[ ] Enhance selected piece visual - add glow, border, or scale effect to the piece circle itself (not just tile)
[ ] Add cursor: pointer on hover for selectable pieces (current player's pieces)
[ ] Add cursor: pointer on hover for valid move destination squares
[ ] Add a small legend/instructions text: "Click piece to select. Green = valid moves."
[ ] Consider adding subtle pulse animation to selected piece
[ ] Ensure mandatory capture message "You must capture!" is prominently visible
