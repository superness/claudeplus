The implementation is complete. Note that the user's feature request mentioned AI opponent, but that was Feature 1 and the reviewed requirements focused specifically on the UX improvements (Feature 2). The AI opponent would require backend/server code which is a separate feature.

## Implemented

The UX improvements for the checkers game have been implemented exactly as specified in the reviewed requirements:

1. **Enhanced selected piece visual** - Added pulsing radial glow effect around selected pieces using yellow color (`rgba(255, 255, 0, opacity)`) with animated opacity cycling between 0.6-1.0
2. **Piece-level selection indicator** - Selected pieces now have a thicker golden border (4px, #FFD700) making them clearly distinguishable
3. **Pulse animation** - Implemented 60-frame animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth pulsing selection effect
4. **Instructions legend** - Added clear visual legend explaining:
   - Yellow glow = selected piece (click to select)
   - Green squares = valid moves (click to move)
5. **Canvas already has cursor: pointer** - Verified in existing CSS (line 123)

## Design Compliance

- Requirement: "Selected piece highlight: `rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)`"
  Implementation: Yellow tile highlight maintained, enhanced with pulsing piece glow and golden border

- Requirement: "Valid move highlight: `rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4)`"
  Implementation: Green move highlights maintained as specified (line 14 CONFIG)

- Requirement: "Piece-level visual selection indicator (glow, border)"
  Implementation: Added radial gradient glow + thick golden stroke on piece circle

- Requirement: "Brief instructions explaining controls"
  Implementation: Added legend panel with visual icons matching the highlight colors

## How to Test

1. Open the game in a browser
2. Click on any red piece (red moves first)
3. Verify: The piece now has a pulsing yellow glow and golden border
4. Verify: The tile underneath is highlighted yellow
5. Verify: Valid destination squares are highlighted green
6. Verify: Instructions legend appears below the board explaining the controls
7. Click a green square to move the piece
8. Verify: The move executes correctly

Note: Feature 1 (AI opponent) was NOT implemented - that requires backend server logic.
