## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

I've read the original design document (game-design.md) and verified the extracted requirements against it:

**Accurately Captured:**
- ✅ Input System specs (lines 289-323) - click-to-select and click-to-move interaction model correctly quoted
- ✅ Rendering System specs (lines 329-355) - highlight colors and requirements correctly quoted
- ✅ Color palette (lines 434-435) - exact color codes match:
  - Valid move highlight: `rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.4)`
  - Selected piece highlight: `rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)`
- ✅ Data structures (InputState, RenderConfig) accurately represented

**Correct Gap Analysis:**
The extracted requirements correctly identify that the design doc specifies:
- Tile-level selection highlight (yellow 50% opacity)
- Valid move destination highlight (green 40% opacity)

But does NOT specify:
- Piece-level visual selection indicator (glow, border, scale on the piece circle itself)
- Hover effects or cursor changes
- Drag-and-drop alternative
- Instructional/explanatory UI text

### Fidelity Verified

- All quotes match the original document exactly
- No invented requirements - gaps are correctly identified as "underspecified" rather than "missing"
- The analysis correctly frames this as a UX polish issue where the design is followed but incomplete
- Referenced line numbers are accurate

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements correctly capture what the design doc specifies and honestly identify what it doesn't. The proposed enhancements (piece-level selection visual, cursor changes, brief instructions) are reasonable UX improvements that fill gaps without contradicting the existing specification.

The implementation checklist is appropriate:
- Enhance selected piece visual (add glow/border to piece circle, not just tile)
- Add cursor: pointer for interactive elements
- Add legend text explaining controls
- Consider pulse animation for selection
- Ensure mandatory capture messaging is visible
