Perfect! Now I understand the schema patterns. Let me create a comprehensive plan:

## UNDERSTANDING
The user wants me to create a complete meta-pipeline system for automating cryptocurrency mining cycle testing. This involves creating 18 specialized agents (each managing different aspects of Bitcoin daemon, pool server, mining client, validation, and support), 8 pipeline templates (covering infrastructure setup, integration testing, development workflows), and comprehensive documentation. The agents will follow the existing JSON schema pattern with id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, and validationCriteria. The pipelines will follow the stages/flow/metadata structure with conditional decision paths.

## APPROACH
I will create a structured plan to build all components systematically:
1. Read the plan document to understand requirements (done)
2. Examine existing agent/pipeline schemas to understand patterns (done)
3. Plan creation of 18 agents following the established schema
4. Plan creation of 8 pipeline templates with proper stage flows
5. Plan creation of 3 documentation files

## STEPS
1. **Create 18 Agent JSON Files** in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/`:
   - Infrastructure agents (6): bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager, wallet_manager, stratum_monitor, network_monitor
   - Integration agents (4): daemon_pool_connector, miner_pool_connector, rpc_tester, config_generator
   - Validation agents (5): job_validator, share_validator, block_validator, cycle_integration_tester, performance_analyzer
   - Support agents (3): log_analyzer, error_recovery_agent, config_generator (already counted)
   
2. **Create 8 Pipeline Template JSON Files** in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/`:
   - Infrastructure pipelines: mining-infrastructure-setup, daemon-pool-integration, miner-integration
   - Testing pipelines: share-submission-test, block-discovery-test, full-mining-cycle
   - Development pipelines: pool-feature-development, pool-bug-fix

3. **Create 3 Documentation Files** in `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/docs/`:
   - AGENT_REFERENCE.md: Comprehensive list of all 18 agents with capabilities
   - PIPELINE_GUIDE.md: How to use each of the 8 pipelines
   - QUICK_START.md: Step-by-step guide for getting started

4. **Each agent will be structured with**:
   - Unique id (snake_case)
   - Descriptive name
   - Clear role statement
   - Expertise array (3-7 items)
   - Detailed systemPrompt covering responsibilities, workflows, tools, best practices
   - outputFormat (typically "markdown")
   - validationCriteria array (3-5 items)

5. **Each pipeline will be structured with**:
   - Unique id and version
   - Description and category
   - Stages array with: id, name, type, agent, description, inputs, decisions
   - Flow object with conditional connections between stages
   - Metadata with tags, author, requirements

6. **Validation approach**:
   - Verify all agent IDs match those referenced in pipeline stages
   - Ensure decision paths in pipelines create valid flow graphs
   - Confirm all file paths are correct for Windows/WSL environment
   - Validate that expertise and systemPrompts align with plan requirements

## TEST_CONSIDERATIONS
1. **Agent Completeness**: Ensure all 18 agents from the plan are created with appropriate expertise for their domain (daemon lifecycle, pool server control, mining client management, validation, etc.)

2. **Pipeline Flow Logic**: Validate that each pipeline has:
   - Proper entry and exit points
   - Valid conditional branching (DECISION paths)
   - Error recovery paths
   - Loops for iterative refinement where appropriate

3. **Schema Compliance**: Check that all JSON files follow the established patterns:
   - Agents have all required fields (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria)
   - Pipelines have stages, flow, and metadata
   - No missing or extra fields

4. **Cross-References**: Verify that:
   - Pipeline stages reference valid agent IDs
   - Decision choices in stages match flow connections
   - Input dependencies between stages are valid

5. **Domain Specificity**: Ensure agents are specialized enough:
   - Bitcoin daemon management includes RPC commands, regtest mode, block generation
   - Pool server management handles Windows/WSL interaction, stratum protocol
   - Validation agents understand mining protocols (share format, difficulty targets, block submission)

6. **Documentation Accuracy**: Documentation should:
   - Reference all 18 agents with correct IDs
   - Describe all 8 pipelines with usage examples
   - Provide working code examples for common workflows
   - Include troubleshooting for WSL/Windows environment issues

## EVIDENCE
I will collect and provide:
1. **File count verification**: Confirm 18 agent JSON files created in claudeplus/agents/
2. **Pipeline count verification**: Confirm 8 pipeline JSON files created in claudeplus/templates/
3. **Documentation verification**: Confirm 3 markdown files created in docs/
4. **JSON validation**: Show that all JSON files are valid and parseable
5. **Schema compliance**: Demonstrate that files follow existing patterns
6. **Cross-reference validation**: Verify agent IDs in pipelines match created agents
7. **Content samples**: Provide excerpts showing domain-specific expertise in systemPrompts
8. **Flow graph validation**: Show that pipeline flows create valid state machines

## CONFIDENCE
**High** - This is a well-structured task with clear requirements and established patterns to follow. The plan document provides detailed specifications for each agent and pipeline. I have examined existing schemas and understand the format. The main complexity is the volume (18 agents + 8 pipelines + 3 docs = 29 files), but each follows a known pattern. The domain knowledge required (Bitcoin mining, stratum protocol, RPC APIs) is documented in the plan, so I can create accurate systemPrompts with appropriate expertise.

Risk factors (all manageable):
- Volume of files requires systematic approach to avoid omissions
- WSL/Windows path handling needs careful attention
- Pipeline flow logic must be validated to avoid dead ends or infinite loops
- Agent expertise must be sufficiently detailed for effective execution

Mitigation: I will work systematically through each agent category, validate JSON syntax, verify cross-references, and provide comprehensive evidence of completeness.
