### Critical Finding: Deeper Physics Issue

The test revealed a **more fundamental problem** than the reported afterburner bug:

1. **Baseline Physics Broken**: With NO afterburner and throttle at 100%, ship velocity remains 0.0 m/s after 3 seconds
2. **Frozen Velocity**: After undocking, ship has 50 m/s velocity that NEVER changes regardless of throttle input
3. **Physics Not Integrating**: Neither acceleration nor deceleration is occurring - velocity is completely frozen

### Evidence Analysis:

**Without Afterburner:**
- Throttle set to 100% ✓
- Velocity at 1s: 0.00 m/s (expected ~30-40 m/s)
- Velocity at 3s: 0.00 m/s (expected ~80+ m/s)

**With Afterburner Fitted:**
- Undock velocity: 50.00 m/s (from undocking animation)
- Throttle to 100% at T+0s
- Velocity at T+0.5s: 50.00 m/s (unchanged)
- Velocity at T+1.5s: 50.00 m/s (unchanged)
- Throttle to 0% at T+1.5s
- Velocity at T+2.0s: 50.00 m/s (still unchanged)

**Console Logs**: 5 Chrome GCM errors (unrelated to game physics)

### Conclusion:

The bug is **NOT** specifically the afterburner causing instant direction/speed changes. The actual issue is that **physics integration is completely disabled or broken** - the ship's velocity never changes in response to throttle input, with or without an afterburner.

The reported symptoms (instant changes) may have been misinterpreted player observations of the undocking animation velocity being "locked in" rather than actual instant acceleration.

**DECISION: execution_complete**
