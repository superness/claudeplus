Perfect! I now have all the evidence I need to make a verification decision. Let me analyze the complete runtime evidence:

## DECISION: BUG_CONFIRMED

**Critical Evidence Summary:**

✅ **Runtime Evidence Present**: 23 WebSocket commands executed, ship state captured at 6 different time points  
✅ **Console Logs Present**: 5 console errors logged (all Chrome GCM authentication, unrelated to physics)  
✅ **Bug Reproduced**: Ship velocity completely frozen - does NOT respond to throttle input  
✅ **State Snapshots**: Velocity values identical across multiple measurements despite throttle changes  

**Bug Confirmed**: Physics integration is completely broken. Ship velocity is frozen at the undocking animation value (~50 m/s) and NEVER changes regardless of throttle input (0% or 100%). This is actually MORE severe than the reported "instant acceleration" bug - there is NO acceleration at all.

**Root Cause Investigation Required**: The bug exists BEFORE and AFTER fitting the afterburner, suggesting either:
1. Physics update loop not running
2. Ship velocity/position being reset/overridden every frame
3. Ship initialization after undocking corrupting physics state
4. Stat synchronization from ship fitting interfering with physics

Proceed to root cause analysis to identify why physics integration has stopped working.
