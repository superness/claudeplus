## Afterburner Physics Bug Reproduction Script Created

I've created a comprehensive automated test script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_afterburner_physics_bug.js` that will reproduce the critical afterburner physics bug.

### What the Script Tests:

**Phase 1: Baseline (No Afterburner)**
- Measures normal ship acceleration over 1-3 seconds
- Verifies EVE-style exponential acceleration curves work correctly
- Records baseline physics behavior

**Phase 2: Fit Afterburner**
- Docks at station
- Adds basic_afterburner to inventory
- Fits it to mid slot 0
- Undocks to test modified physics

**Phase 3: Bug Reproduction (With Afterburner)**
- Tests acceleration with afterburner fitted
- **BUG CHECK 1**: Detects instant acceleration (speed > 50 m/s after 0.5s)
- **BUG CHECK 2**: Measures acceleration rate vs baseline
- **BUG CHECK 3**: Detects instant deceleration (>80% speed loss in 0.5s)

### Bug Detection Logic:

The script will reproduce the bug if it detects:
1. **Instant acceleration**: Ship reaches high speed in 0.5s instead of gradual exponential curve
2. **Instant deceleration**: When throttle is cut to 0%, speed drops >80% in 0.5s instead of gradual decay

### Evidence Collected:

The script saves comprehensive evidence including:
- Before/after physics data (speed at 0.5s, 1s, 1.5s, 3s)
- Acceleration rates and curves
- Console logs with errors/exceptions
- Complete command history with timestamps
- Bug reproduction status

### To Run:

```bash
node test_afterburner_physics_bug.js
```

The script will:
1. Launch Chrome with test mode
2. Execute the test sequence automatically
3. Save evidence to `bug_evidence_afterburner_physics_[timestamp].json`
4. Print a clear verdict: BUG REPRODUCED or working correctly

**DECISION: script_ready**
