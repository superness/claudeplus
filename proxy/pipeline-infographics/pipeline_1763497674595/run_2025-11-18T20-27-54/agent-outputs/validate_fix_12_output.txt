Now I understand the situation. The fix was implemented for **stat synchronization**, but the evidence shows the **physics bug is still present**. Let me analyze the physics data from the most recent evidence:

## Fix Validation Analysis

### Evidence Summary

The most recent test run shows:

**Before Afterburner Fitted:**
- Speed at 1s: **81.85 m/s** ✅ (gradual exponential acceleration)
- Speed at 3s: **143.55 m/s** ✅ (continuing to accelerate)
- **Normal acceleration curve** ✅

**After Afterburner Fitted:**
- Speed at 0.5s: **525 m/s** 🔴 (INSTANT - should be ~40-60 m/s)
- Speed at 1.5s: **525 m/s** 🔴 (no acceleration, already at max)
- Deceleration: **525 → 0 m/s in 0.5s** 🔴 (INSTANT drop)

### Root Cause Analysis

The `afterburner_stat_sync_fix_summary.json` describes a fix for **stat synchronization** - ensuring that when an afterburner is fitted, the stats (maxVelocity, agility) are properly transferred from the fitting manager to the ship's physics engine.

However, the evidence proves that **stat synchronization is not the problem**. The afterburner IS applying its stats (the ship reaches 525 m/s, which is 350 × 1.5), but the **physics integration is completely bypassed**.

### The Real Bug

The instant acceleration/deceleration indicates:
1. ✅ Stats ARE syncing (ship reaches 525 m/s = afterburner boost working)
2. 🔴 Physics curves ARE bypassed (instant speed changes)
3. 🔴 The afterburner is likely **directly setting velocity** instead of applying forces

### Before vs After Comparison

**Fix Implemented:** Stat synchronization via flag-based system
**Fix Target:** Ensure afterburner stats transfer to physics engine

**Bug STILL Present:**
- Before fix: Instant acceleration to 525 m/s ❌
- After fix: Instant acceleration to 525 m/s ❌
- **NO CHANGE** in the physics bypass issue

### Regression Check

**No new regressions detected:**
- Normal physics (without afterburner) still works: ✅
- Fitting system functional: ✅
- Ship state tracking working: ✅
- No new errors in console (only Chrome internal GCM errors): ✅
