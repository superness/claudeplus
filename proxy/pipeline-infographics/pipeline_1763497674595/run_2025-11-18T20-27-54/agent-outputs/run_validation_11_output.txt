## Execution Summary

The bug reproduction test has been **successfully executed** with conclusive results.

### Test Execution Results

**Environment Setup:** ✅
- HTTP server running with no-cache mode (`-c-1`)
- Old Chrome processes cleaned up
- Clean test environment established

**Script Execution:** ✅
- Found and executed `test_afterburner_physics_bug.js`
- 23 automated test commands completed
- Evidence file generated with complete physics data

### Bug Reproduction: CONFIRMED ✅

The test successfully reproduced the critical afterburner physics bug with clear evidence:

**Normal Physics (Baseline):**
- Speed at 1s: 81.85 m/s
- Speed at 3s: 143.55 m/s  
- Gradual exponential acceleration curve ✅

**With Afterburner Fitted (Bug):**
- Speed at 0.5s: **525 m/s** 🔴 (INSTANT - should be ~40 m/s)
- Speed at 1.5s: 525 m/s (no acceleration curve)
- Deceleration: **525 → 0 m/s in 0.5s** 🔴 (100% instant drop)

### Bug Symptoms Confirmed:
1. ✅ Instant acceleration to max speed (bypassing exponential curve)
2. ✅ Instant deceleration when throttle cut (bypassing physics decay)
3. ✅ Afterburner completely bypasses EVE-style physics integration

### Evidence Collected:
- **Evidence file:** `bug_evidence_afterburner_physics_1763499020933.json`
- **Console logs:** 5 entries (all Chrome internal, no game errors)
- **Physics data:** Complete before/after comparison
- **Console log file:** Captured and validated

The previous fix attempt (`test_afterburner_stat_sync.js`) addressed stat synchronization but **did not fix the instant acceleration/deceleration bug**. The reproduction test proves the core physics bypass issue remains.
