Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me analyze this critical bug:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Afterburner module causes instant direction/speed changes bypassing EVE-style physics acceleration",
  "expectedBehavior": "When afterburner is fitted, it should multiply maxVelocity by 1.5x (basic) or higher (improved/advanced), allowing the ship to reach higher speeds while STILL respecting EVE-style exponential acceleration curves and ship rotation-based movement direction",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship instantly changes movement direction even while still rotating, and throttle changes instantly affect speed without proper acceleration/deceleration curves. This suggests the afterburner effect is either overriding physics or the stat sync is corrupting velocity calculations",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "ship_fitting",
    "physics_engine",
    "stat_synchronization",
    "ship_movement"
  ],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Launch the game and undock from station",
    "Step 2: Verify normal ship movement works (gradual acceleration, direction follows ship rotation)",
    "Step 3: Open ship fitting interface and fit a 'basic_afterburner' to a mid slot",
    "Step 4: Close fitting interface and attempt to move the ship",
    "Step 5: Observe instant direction changes and instant speed changes (physics broken)",
    "Step 6: Unfit the afterburner module",
    "Step 7: Observe that physics returns to normal (confirms afterburner is the cause)"

  "hypothesis": "Root cause analysis:\n\n1. **Afterburner Effect Definition** (ContentManager.js:88-90):\n   - `maxSpeed: { type: 'multiply', value: 1.5 }` - This is CORRECT\n   - `agility: { type: 'multiply', value: 0.9 }` - This is CORRECT (0.9 = 10% better agility)\n\n2. **Stat Application** (ShipFittingManager.js:315-342):\n   - The `applyItemEffects()` method applies multiply effects correctly for maxSpeed\n   - However, it maps 'maxSpeed' to 'maxVelocity' (line 321-324) - this is expected\n\n3. **Stat Synchronization** (Ship.js:59-106):\n   - `syncStatsFromFitting()` is called EVERY FRAME in `updateWithNavigation()` (line 203)\n   - This reads `fitting.currentStats.maxSpeed` or falls back to `maxVelocity`\n   - Updates `this.physics.maxVelocity` and recalculates `timeConstant`\n\n4. **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:\n   - Line 203 in Ship.js: `this.syncStatsFromFitting()` is called EVERY FRAME\n   - Line 82 in Ship.js: When agility changes, timeConstant is recalculated: `this.physics.timeConstant = stats.agility / 500000`\n   - **BUG**: When agility gets multiplied by the afterburner effect (0.9x), this ALSO changes the timeConstant\n   - The multiply effect in applyItemEffects (line 336-340) is applied EVERY TIME recalculateShipStats() is called\n   - If agility multiply is applied multiple times, it compounds: agility * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9...\n   - This would cause timeConstant to approach zero, making acceleration INSTANT\n\n5. **Additional Physics Corruption**:\n   - ShipPhysics.js line 156-163: Exponential acceleration formula\n   - If timeConstant becomes very small, `k = 1/timeConstant` becomes very large\n   - `factor = 1 - Math.exp(-k * deltaTime)` approaches 1.0\n   - This makes acceleration instant instead of gradual\n\n**Root Cause**: ShipFittingManager.recalculateShipStats() (line 348-374) resets to base stats and re-applies ALL effects, but the multiply effects in applyItemEffects() might be compounding if called multiple times, OR the stat sync is being called too frequently causing physics corruption.",
