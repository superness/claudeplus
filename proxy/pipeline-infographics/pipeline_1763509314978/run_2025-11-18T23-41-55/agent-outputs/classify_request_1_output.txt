  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'critical bug' and describes a broken game mechanic where the mission objective does not complete despite the player performing the required actions (crafting and equipping an afterburner). The mission tracking system is failing to recognize completion, which is a functional defect that needs repair. Key indicators include: 'cannot complete', 'does not recognize completion', 'remains stuck', 'completion trigger is not firing', and the explicit instruction to 'Fix the bug'.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The player is experiencing a critical bug in the first mission where they cannot complete the quest objective 'Craft and Fit an Item'. The player successfully crafts an afterburner and equips it to their ship, but the mission does not recognize completion and remains stuck. Investigate the mission tracking system, specifically how it detects when items are crafted and equipped. Identify why the completion trigger is not firing when the player fits the afterburner. Fix the bug so that crafting and equipping an item properly completes this mission objective.",
