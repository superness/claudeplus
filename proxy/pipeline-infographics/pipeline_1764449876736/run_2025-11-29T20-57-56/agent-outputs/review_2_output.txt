ASSESSMENT:

This plan demonstrates a thorough understanding of the technical requirements for building a Bitcoin Core fork. The planner has correctly identified the 12-phase structure from the technical document and has broken down each phase into concrete, actionable steps. The approach of starting with Bitcoin Core v26.0 and systematically applying branding changes, consensus modifications, and SuperAxeCoin-specific implementations is sound.

However, I have several critical concerns:

1. **Scope vs. Reality**: This is an enormous undertaking - essentially forking and customizing Bitcoin Core, a multi-million line codebase. The plan lists 50+ distinct steps, many of which are substantial development efforts in themselves (e.g., "Mine mainnet genesis block", "Create functional tests", "Configure cross-compilation for 4 platforms").

2. **Missing Prerequisite Verification**: The plan doesn't verify whether required build tools exist (CMake, compilers, cross-compilation toolchains). Building Bitcoin Core requires significant toolchain setup.

3. **Genesis Block Mining Ambiguity**: The plan mentions "create genesis block mining utility tool" but doesn't specify how this will work. Mining a real genesis block with mainnet difficulty (0x1d00ffff) requires significant computational resources.

4. **Dependency Management**: Bitcoin Core has many external dependencies (Boost, libevent, OpenSSL, etc.). The plan doesn't address dependency installation.

5. **Time/Resource Constraints**: This plan could take weeks to fully implement. There's no prioritization of what's essential vs. nice-to-have.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong** - The proposed evidence is excellent and concrete:
- Successful compilation of binaries ✓
- Unit tests passing ✓
- Functional tests passing ✓
- Genesis block verification ✓
- Address prefix verification (S/X/axe1) ✓
- Block reward values at specific heights ✓
- Difficulty adjustment bounds verification ✓

These are all objectively verifiable outcomes that would definitively prove the task was completed.

The planner correctly rated confidence as "Medium" with honest reasoning about the complexity involved. The plan is methodologically sound - the question is whether it's achievable in a reasonable scope.

**Key Strength**: The existing skeleton files (chainparams.cpp, pow.cpp, validation.cpp, params.h) already contain the SuperAxeCoin-specific logic, which significantly reduces the custom development work needed.

**Key Risk**: The plan treats this as one implementation task, but it's really a project that would benefit from incremental milestones and user checkpoints.
