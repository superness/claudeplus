## Execution Summary

I executed the reproduction script `test_craft_fit_mission_bug.js` successfully, but encountered a **framework error** before the bug could be reproduced.

### Environment Setup ✓
- HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled (`-c-1` flag)
- Old Chrome processes cleaned up
- Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`
- WebSocket server on port 8765

### Script Execution
- **Script Found**: `test_craft_fit_mission_bug.js`
- **Script Executed**: Yes (exit code 0)
- **Commands Executed**: 2 out of 10 (partial)

### Results

**Status**: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

**What Worked**:
1. ✓ Mission state retrieved successfully
2. ✓ Confirmed crafting mission exists: `first_crafting` (Ship Enhancement)
3. ✓ Mission is incomplete (0/1 modules crafted)

**What Failed**:
- **Command**: `createTestStation`
- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
- **Location**: `GameTestingInterface.js:1762:36`
- **Root Cause**: `simulator.stationManager.createStation()` returned `null`, indicating the StationManager or required game systems were not fully initialized when the test command was executed.

### Evidence Collected
- **Evidence File**: `bug_evidence_1763510387393.json`
- **Console Logs**: 5 entries (Chrome internal errors only, not game errors)
- **Console Log File**: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log` (2.4MB)

### Framework Error Analysis

The test infrastructure failed before reaching the actual mission tracking bug. The `createTestStation()` method failed because:
1. The game simulator had not fully initialized all required systems
2. StationManager returned `null` instead of a station object
3. The code attempted to access `.id` on the null object, causing the crash

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
