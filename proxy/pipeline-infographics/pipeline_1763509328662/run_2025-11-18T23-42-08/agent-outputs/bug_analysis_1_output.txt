Excellent! Now I have all the information I need to complete the bug analysis.

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Mission objective 'Craft and Fit an Item' does not complete when player crafts and equips an afterburner",
  "expectedBehavior": "When the player crafts an item (afterburner) and equips it to their ship during the tutorial mission, the mission objective 'craft_item' should be marked as completed, allowing progression to the next tutorial step",
  "actualBehavior": "The player successfully crafts the afterburner (CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event) and equips it (ShipFittingManager.fitItem() succeeds), but the mission objective remains incomplete. The player cannot progress past this tutorial step",
  "affectedSystems": ["Mission tracking", "Crafting system", "Ship fitting system", "Tutorial progression"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Start the game and complete initial tutorial popups",
    "Step 2: Accept the 'Quantum Universe Orientation' tutorial mission",
    "Step 3: Dock at a station to access crafting and fitting",
    "Step 4: Gather materials and start crafting an afterburner using CraftingManager.startCraftingJob('basic_afterburner_bp')",
    "Step 5: Wait for crafting to complete (CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event)",
    "Step 6: Equip the crafted afterburner to ship using ShipFittingManager.fitItem()",
    "Step 7: Observe that mission objective 'craft_item' remains incomplete despite both actions succeeding"

  "hypothesis": "ROOT CAUSE: Event listener mismatch between CraftingManager and UniverseIntegrationManager mission tracking system.\n\nThe bug occurs in UniverseIntegrationManager.trackCraftingActions() (lines 1053-1095):\n\n1. The method attempts to hook into craftingManager.craftItem() method (line 1059-1072)\n2. However, CraftingManager does NOT have a craftItem() method - it uses startCraftingJob() instead\n3. The fallback attempts to hook fittingManager.equipModule() (line 1078-1092)\n4. However, ShipFittingManager does NOT have an equipModule() method - it uses fitItem() instead\n5. As a result, NEITHER crafting NOR fitting actions are tracked\n6. The mission objective is never triggered via checkMissionProgress('craft_item')\n\nACTUAL EVENTS FIRED:\n- CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted' custom event (CraftingManager.js:176)\n- ShipFittingManager fires 'inventoryUpdated' custom event (ShipFittingManager.js:293)\n- ShipFittingManager fires 'shipStatsUpdated' custom event (already tracked elsewhere)\n\nFIX REQUIRED:\nReplace method hooking with event listener approach:\n1. Listen for 'craftingJobCompleted' event from CraftingManager\n2. When event fires, call this.checkMissionProgress('craft_item')\n3. This will properly track when items are crafted AND automatically complete the mission objective"
