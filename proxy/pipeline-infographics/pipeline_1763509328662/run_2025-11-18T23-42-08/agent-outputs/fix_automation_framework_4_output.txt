## Framework Fix Complete

I have successfully fixed the framework error that was preventing the reproduction test from running. Here's what was done:

### **Root Cause**
The `PlayerProgressionManager` class was loaded in `index.html` but **never instantiated** in `SpaceshipSimulator.js`. This caused the reproduction test to fail when trying to access mission state.

### **Solution Implemented**

#### 1. **Added PlayerProgressionManager to SpaceshipSimulator** (`js/SpaceshipSimulator.js`)
   - Added property declaration at line 23
   - Initialized the manager at lines 248-256 with required dependencies:
     - `economyManager` ✅
     - `navigationManager` ✅
     - `factionManager` → null (safe - not yet implemented)
     - `threatManager` → null (safe - code checks before using)
   - Made globally available via `window.playerProgressionManager`

#### 2. **Connected Event Listeners** (lines 324-365)
   - Created `setupMissionEventListeners()` method
   - Listens for `craftingJobCompleted` events from CraftingManager
   - Listens for `shipStatsUpdated` events from ShipFittingManager
   - Calls `playerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted()` when items are crafted
   - Tracks when modules are fitted to the player ship

#### 3. **Mission Tracking Flow**
   ```
   Player crafts item
   → CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted'
   → Event listener calls recordModuleCrafted()
   → Increments statistics.modules_crafted
   → Calls checkObjectiveProgress()
   → Checks if modules_crafted >= 1
   → Completes 'first_crafting' mission objective ✅
   ```

### **Verification**
- ✅ Syntax validation passed: `SpaceshipSimulator.js` compiles without errors
- ✅ PlayerProgressionManager initialization code is in place
- ✅ Event listeners are properly configured
- ✅ Mission tracking integration is complete

### **Files Modified**
- `js/SpaceshipSimulator.js` - Added PlayerProgressionManager initialization and event listeners

### **Documentation Created**
- `FRAMEWORK_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete fix documentation

The framework is now ready for the reproduction test to retry. The test should no longer encounter the "PlayerProgressionManager not available" error.
