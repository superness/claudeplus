## Framework Error Analysis

**Root Cause:** The reproduction test cannot execute because `PlayerProgressionManager` is not available in the game. 

**Why this happened:**
1. The base simulator (`index.html` → `SpaceshipSimulator.js`) does not load quantum universe systems
2. `PlayerProgressionManager` is part of the quantum universe architecture (in `js/systems/`)
3. Mission tracking requires `PlayerProgressionManager` to function
4. The test command `getMissionState` fails immediately when trying to access the missing manager

**Architecture Context (from CLAUDE.md):**
> **DUAL ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION**: The codebase currently contains two parallel systems:
> 1. **Legacy Simulator** (`SpaceshipSimulator.js`) - Original EVE-style simulator (currently functional)
> 2. **Quantum Universe** (`MasterGameIntegration.js`) - New comprehensive game system (in development)
> 
> `index.html` primarily loads the base simulator; quantum systems are being integrated

**The Problem:**
- The bug involves **missions** (quantum universe feature)
- The reproduction test runs against **base simulator** (no mission system)
- This is not a bug in the reproduction script - it's a **framework limitation**

**Evidence Quality:**
✅ Console logs captured successfully (5 entries)
✅ Error details captured with stack trace
✅ Evidence file contains all metadata
❌ Test could not execute - missing game system dependency

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
