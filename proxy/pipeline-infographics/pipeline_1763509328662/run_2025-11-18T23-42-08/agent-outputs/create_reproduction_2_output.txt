Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the mission tracking bug. The script:

## What the script does:

1. **Gets initial mission state** - Shows the "craft_item" objective is incomplete
2. **Creates test station and docks** - Required for crafting/fitting
3. **Adds crafting materials** - Gives player tritanium
4. **Starts crafting job** - Uses `startCraftingJob('basic_afterburner_bp')` (the correct API)
5. **Force-completes crafting** - Triggers `'craftingJobCompleted'` event
6. **Checks mission state** - **BUG REPRODUCED** - Mission should complete but doesn't!
7. **Fits the afterburner** - In case mission requires both actions
8. **Final check** - Confirms mission still incomplete

## Why the bug occurs:

The script includes detailed comments explaining the root cause:

```javascript
// ROOT CAUSE: UniverseIntegrationManager.trackCraftingActions() (lines 1053-1095)
// attempts to hook into craftingManager.craftItem() method, which doesn't exist.
//
// CraftingManager actually uses:
// - startCraftingJob() method
// - fires 'craftingJobCompleted' custom event (line 176)
//
// Since the method hook fails, mission tracking never triggers.
```

The reproduction script will:
- **Return `false`** when the bug is reproduced (mission doesn't complete)
- Save evidence with console logs showing the 'craftingJobCompleted' event fired but mission didn't progress
- Clearly demonstrate that the tracking system is broken

**DECISION: script_ready**
