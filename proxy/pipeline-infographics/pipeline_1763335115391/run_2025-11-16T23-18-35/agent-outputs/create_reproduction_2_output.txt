Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the ship movement bug. Here's the complete output:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_ship_movement_bug_final.js",
  "scriptContent": "Complete Node.js script with WebSocket server - see file content above",

        "speedSetting": 0.75
      },
      "expectedResult": "Navigation target successfully set"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": { "duration": 2000 },
      "expectedResult": "Wait 2 seconds for ship physics to respond"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "Bug reproduced: ship has NOT moved (position still at origin, velocity still zero)"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": { "duration": 3000 },
      "expectedResult": "Wait additional 3 seconds to confirm"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "Final confirmation: ship STILL has not moved after 5 seconds total - BUG CONFIRMED"
    }
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": [
    "ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json"
  ],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug successfully reproduced when ship remains stationary despite navigation target being set to (1000, 0, 500) with speedSetting 0.75. After 5 seconds, ship should have moved toward target but remains at origin with zero velocity.",
  "executionInstructions": [
    "1. Ensure http-server is running on port 8080 (npm start)",
    "2. Run: node tests/reproduce_ship_movement_bug_final.js",
    "3. Script will launch Chrome with game in testMode",
    "4. Script will automatically execute command sequence",
    "5. Evidence file will be saved with timestamp",
    "6. Exit code 0 = bug reproduced, Exit code 1 = bug not found"
  ],
  "keyFeatures": [
    "WebSocket automation server on port 8765",
    "Automated Chrome launch with testMode parameter",
    "6-step command sequence to reproduce bug",
    "Detailed evidence collection with observations at each phase",
    "Position and velocity tracking to confirm ship remains stationary",
    "5-second total wait time to ensure physics has time to respond",
    "Clear console output showing reproduction progress",
    "JSON evidence file with complete command/response history"
  ]
}
```

## Script Highlights

The reproduction script:

1. **Starts WebSocket Server** - Launches automation server on port 8765
2. **Launches Game** - Opens Chrome with `?testMode=true` parameter
3. **Executes Test Sequence**:
   - Gets initial ship state (position at origin, velocity zero)
   - Sets navigation target to (1000, 0, 500) with speedSetting 0.75
   - Waits 2 seconds for ship to respond
   - Checks if ship moved (expects NO movement - bug reproduction)
   - Waits 3 more seconds (total 5s)
   - Final check confirms ship still hasn't moved
4. **Collects Evidence** - Saves complete command/response history with observations
5. **Reports Result** - Clear console output indicating bug reproduction status

## Evidence Collected

The script tracks:
- Initial ship position and velocity
- Navigation command parameters (target coordinates, speedSetting)
- Ship state after 2 seconds
- Ship state after 5 seconds total
- Whether ship actually moved (position changed from origin)
- Whether ship has velocity (velocity magnitude > 0.1)

**Bug is confirmed** when ship remains at origin (0,0,0) with zero velocity despite having navigation target set for 5 seconds.
