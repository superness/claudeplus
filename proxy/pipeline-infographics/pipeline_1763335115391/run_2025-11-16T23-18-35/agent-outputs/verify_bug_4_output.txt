Based on the evidence provided, I need to analyze whether the bug was successfully reproduced through WebSocket automation:

## Evidence Analysis

### ❌ Runtime Evidence Present: NO

**Evidence File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763335305675.json`
- Status: FAILED
- Commands executed: 1 (setNavigationTarget)
- Command response: "Command failed: undefined"

### Key Findings:

1. **WebSocket Infrastructure**: ✅ Working
   - Dev server running on port 8080
   - WebSocket automation server started on port 8765
   - Game connected successfully
   - Test client connected successfully

2. **Command Execution**: ❌ FAILED
   - Attempted command: `setNavigationTarget`
   - Result: "Command failed: undefined"
   - Root cause: `setNavigationTarget` is NOT implemented in GameTestingInterface.js

3. **Available Commands**:
   - getShipState, getSceneInfo, setThrottle, dock, undock, getInventory, fitItem, unfitItem, setPosition, addResource, triggerCombat, resetGameState, executeBatch, listCommands
   - **Missing**: setNavigationTarget

4. **What This Means**:
   - The automation framework cannot test navigation target setting
   - No actual ship movement was triggered
   - No ship state data captured showing position/velocity before/after navigation command
   - The test infrastructure is incomplete for this bug type

### Evidence Quality Assessment:

```json
{
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "Command returned 'undefined' - not implemented",
    "stateInconsistency": "No game state captured - command never executed",
    "matchesBugReport": false,
    "automationFrameworkIssue": true
  },
  "reasoning": "The reproduction attempt failed because the automation framework lacks the setNavigationTarget command. Without this command, we cannot programmatically trigger the navigation system and capture ship movement data. The evidence.json shows infrastructure success but test failure due to missing command implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": "Either: (1) Implement setNavigationTarget in GameTestingInterface.js and re-run reproduction, OR (2) Use manual testing with console logging to capture ship state, OR (3) Use existing setThrottle + setPosition commands as alternative test approach"
}
```

### Decision Rationale:

While the bug analysis phase identified likely root causes in Ship.js (calculateThrustFromNavigation method), the **automated reproduction attempt did not execute**. The WebSocket automation infrastructure worked correctly, but the test script called a non-existent command (`setNavigationTarget`), preventing any actual game state from being captured.

Without runtime evidence showing:
- Ship position before/after navigation command
- Velocity/thrust vectors during navigation
- Actual execution of navigation logic
- State snapshots proving the bug occurs

I cannot confirm the bug exists based on this evidence alone.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (WebSocket automation framework incomplete - setNavigationTarget command not implemented in GameTestingInterface.js, preventing runtime evidence collection)
