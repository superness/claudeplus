# Bug Existence Verification Analysis

## Step 1: Parse WebSocket Evidence

Loading evidence from: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763335455703.json`

```json
{
  "command": "setThrottle",
  "params": {"value": 50},
  "response": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": {
      "id": "1",
      "command": "setThrottle",
      "params": {"value": 50}
    }
  },
  "success": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-16T23:24:15.703Z"
}
```

## Step 2: Evidence Quality Assessment

### Runtime Evidence Present?
✅ **YES** - WebSocket automation was executed with:
- Live WebSocket server on port 8765
- Game connected to automation server
- Test client connected successfully
- Command sent: `setThrottle` with value 50
- Response received (though malformed)

### Critical Problem Identified

**The evidence reveals an infrastructure issue, NOT the ship movement bug itself.**

**Observed**: 
- WebSocket automation infrastructure exists
- Command was sent to the game
- Game echoed command back instead of executing it
- Response format: `{type: 'command', command: {...}}` (relay/echo behavior)
- Expected format: `{id: string, success: boolean, data: object}` (execution result)

**Root Cause**: The WebSocket automation layer (`TestingBrowserBridge`) does not execute commands on the game simulator - it only relays/echoes them back to the client.

## Step 3: Verification Decision

### Evidence Analysis

```json
{
  "runtimeEvidencePresent": true,
  "websocketResponses": "Command sent successfully, but game echoed instead of executing",
  "stateInconsistency": "Cannot verify - command was not executed by game engine",
  "matchesBugReport": false,
  "infraBlocker": "WebSocket automation layer incomplete - commands not routed to simulator"
}
```

### Critical Distinction

**Bug Report**: "Ship does not move when navigation targets are set"

**Evidence Shows**: "WebSocket automation commands are not executed by the game at all - they are only echoed back"

**Implication**: The test infrastructure cannot yet verify the ship movement bug because commands don't reach the game engine.

## Conclusion

The WebSocket automation test **successfully connected** and **sent commands**, but revealed a **blocker in the automation infrastructure** itself:

1. ✅ WebSocket server running
2. ✅ Game connected
3. ✅ Commands sent
4. ❌ **Commands NOT executed** - game echoes instead of processing
5. ❌ **Cannot verify ship movement** - no state changes occurred

The evidence is **runtime evidence**, but it proves the **testing infrastructure is incomplete**, not that the ship movement bug exists or doesn't exist.

### Reasoning

- **NOT BUG_CONFIRMED**: We have no evidence the ship movement bug occurred (command never executed)
- **NOT NOT_REPRODUCED**: We couldn't attempt to reproduce the bug (infrastructure blocked us)
- **IS INCONCLUSIVE**: Runtime evidence exists, but the automation layer failed before testing could occur

### Next Steps Required

**Before verifying the ship movement bug:**

1. Fix `TestingBrowserBridge` in the game to:
   - Receive WebSocket commands
   - Execute them on the simulator instance
   - Return proper `{id, success, data}` responses

2. Then re-run the ship movement test with:
   - `setNavigationTarget` command
   - `getShipState` to verify position/velocity
   - Compare expected vs actual movement

**Confidence**: 0.95 (high confidence the infrastructure is broken, cannot yet test the reported bug)

---

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (Runtime automation infrastructure incomplete - cannot verify ship movement bug until WebSocket command execution is implemented)
