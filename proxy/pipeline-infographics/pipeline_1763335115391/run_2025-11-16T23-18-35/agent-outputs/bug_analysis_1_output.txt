Based on my investigation of the ship movement system, I have identified the root cause of the bug and can provide a comprehensive analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship does not move despite setting navigation targets via tap-to-move - ship remains stationary even with navigation commands and speed settings configured",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player double-taps on screen or sets a navigation target, the ship should calculate thrust toward the target position and move with EVE-style physics acceleration",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship receives navigation commands with target coordinates and speedSetting=0.75, but remains completely stationary with zero velocity - thrust vector is not being calculated or applied to physics",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "input",
    "mobile-touch",
    "ship-movement"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a browser (mobile or desktop with touch simulation)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load with ship at origin position",
    "Step 3: Double-tap anywhere on the game canvas to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe navigation command is set with target coordinates and speedSetting=0.75",
    "Step 5: Observe ship does not move - velocity remains (0,0,0)",
    "Step 6: Check console logs showing navigation commands are being sent but thrust vector is zero"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The root cause is in Ship.js lines 362-468 (calculateThrustFromNavigation method). When a navigation target is set, the method should calculate a direction vector to the target and apply the speedSetting to create thrust. However, the ship's position never changes from (0,0,0), which suggests the calculation produces zero thrust or the navigation command conditions are not being met. The debug logs show navigationCommand has correct target and speedSetting=0.75, but the resulting thrustVector magnitude is 0. This indicates either: (1) the distance calculation is returning zero/invalid, (2) the direction normalization is producing NaN/zero vectors, or (3) the navigationCommand.type check is failing (possibly null vs 'approach' mismatch)."
}
