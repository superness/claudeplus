## Execution Report

**Status**: Reproduction test executed, infrastructure limitations identified

### Observable Facts

1. **Dev Server**: Confirmed running on http://localhost:8080
2. **WebSocket Server**: Started successfully on port 8765
3. **Game Connection**: Game connected to automation server
4. **Test Client**: Connected successfully
5. **Commands Executed**: 1 command attempted (`setThrottle` with value 50)
6. **Command Result**: Failed with "Unknown error"
7. **Exit Code**: 1 (failure)

### Evidence Captured

**File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763335455703.json`

```json
{
  "command": "setThrottle",
  "params": {"value": 50},
  "response": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": {
      "id": "1",
      "command": "setThrottle",
      "params": {"value": 50}
    }
  },
  "success": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-16T23:24:15.703Z"
}
```

### Technical Observations

1. **Response Format Issue**: Game echoed the command back instead of executing it and returning a result
2. **Expected Format**: `{id: string, success: boolean, data: object}`
3. **Actual Format**: `{type: 'command', command: {id, command, params}}`
4. **Implication**: WebSocket automation message routing incomplete - game acts as relay, not command executor

### Console Output

```
[Server] WebSocket automation server started on port 8765
[Server] Game connected to automation server
[Server] Test client connected
[Test] Test client ready!
[undefined] Set throttle to 50%
Success: undefined
✗ Command failed: Unknown error
[Evidence] Status: COMMAND_FAILED
```

### Root Cause

The game's WebSocket automation handler (TestingBrowserBridge) receives commands via WebSocket but does not:
- Execute the commands on the game simulator
- Send proper response objects with `success` and `data` fields
- Process the command through the automation API layer
