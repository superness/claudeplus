## VERIFICATION: Detailed Analysis

The share_validator agent has been successfully created at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/share_validator.json`. Let me now validate against section 2.3 requirements:

### Section 2.3 Requirements from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md:

**Lines 284-304 specify:**
- Purpose: Test share submission and pool acceptance
- Monitor share submissions ✅
- Parse share format (nonce, hash) ✅
- Check pool responses (accept/reject) ✅
- Validate difficulty target ✅
- Track share acceptance rate ✅
- Log reject reasons ✅

### Agent Implementation Analysis:

**1. Monitor Share Submissions** ✅
- System prompt section 1: "SHARE SUBMISSION MONITORING"
- Expertise: "Mining share validation and verification"
- Monitoring commands included with grep/tail examples
- Configuration: `validation_interval_seconds: 5`
- Tracks per-worker and per-miner rates

**2. Parse Share Format (nonce, hash)** ✅
- System prompt section 2: "SHARE FORMAT PARSING"
- Expertise: "Share format parsing (nonce, hash, extraNonce)"
- Extracts: worker name, job_id, extranonce2, ntime, nonce
- Stratum protocol compliance validation
- Hex decoding support
- 6 mining algorithms supported

**3. Check Pool Responses (accept/reject)** ✅
- System prompt section 3: "POOL RESPONSE CHECKING"
- Parses accept: `{"result": true, "error": null}`
- Parses reject: Error codes 20-24 documented
- Configuration: `pool_response_timeout_seconds: 10`
- Response time tracking

**4. Validate Difficulty Target** ✅
- System prompt section 4: "DIFFICULTY TARGET VALIDATION"
- Expertise: "Proof-of-work difficulty target validation"
- Calculates: `share_difficulty = difficulty_1_target / share_hash`
- VARDIFF support
- Block-worthy share detection
- Configuration: `difficulty_validation_enabled: true`

**5. Track Share Acceptance Rate** ✅
- System prompt section 5: "SHARE ACCEPTANCE RATE TRACKING"
- Expertise: "Share acceptance rate tracking and analysis"
- Formula: `(accepted / total) * 100`
- Per-worker, per-miner, per-algorithm tracking
- Configuration: `acceptance_rate_threshold_percent: 90.0`
- Alert thresholds: low acceptance 85%, high rejection 15%

**6. Log Reject Reasons** ✅
- System prompt section 6: "REJECTION REASON LOGGING"
- Expertise: "Rejection reason categorization and logging"
- 8 categorized reasons: stale, duplicate, low difficulty, invalid nonce, time manipulation, invalid job, unauthorized, malformed
- Pattern detection
- Alert on unusual patterns

**7. Test Share Submission and Pool Acceptance** ✅
- Description explicitly states this purpose
- 6-step validation workflow documented
- Integration with pool_server_manager and miner_manager

### Required Permissions ✅
All present in `requiredTools`: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

### Required Decisions ✅
All 4 decisions properly defined:
- **share_accepted**: Clear criteria with evidence (pool log + Stratum response)
- **share_rejected**: Error codes 20-24, rejection reasons
- **shares_validated**: Batch processing with statistics
- **error**: Parsing failures, pool unresponsive, log access issues

## EVIDENCE_CHECK: Assessment

The validation performed by the previous executor was **comprehensive and accurate**:

1. **File Existence**: Verified at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/share_validator.json`
2. **JSON Validity**: Confirmed with Python json.tool ✅
3. **File Size**: 14 KB (142 lines) - substantial implementation
4. **Requirements Mapping**: Every requirement from section 2.3 traced to implementation
5. **Quality Metrics**: All validation criteria met with detailed analysis

**Additional verification performed**:
- I independently read the agent file ✅
- I independently read the plan document section 2.3 ✅
- I validated JSON syntax ✅
- All claims in the validation report are accurate ✅

## QUALITY_ASSESSMENT: Work Completeness

**Strengths**:
1. **Comprehensive system prompt** with 6 detailed sections matching all requirements
2. **Extensive bash commands** for monitoring, parsing, and database queries
3. **Well-defined configuration** with 10+ parameters
4. **Clear decision criteria** with evidence requirements
5. **13 validation criteria** providing measurable success metrics
6. **Integration points** properly defined with 4 agent dependencies
7. **Extensive expertise coverage** (12 areas)
8. **Output specification** includes events, metrics, and reports

**Completeness vs Requirements**:
- ✅ All 7 requirements from section 2.3 implemented
- ✅ All required permissions included
- ✅ All required decisions defined with criteria
- ✅ Monitoring commands with real bash/grep examples
- ✅ Stratum protocol parsing detailed
- ✅ Error handling documented
- ✅ Configuration parameters comprehensive

**Quality Indicators**:
