ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates solid comprehension of the share_validator agent requirements, including share parsing, pool response monitoring, difficulty validation, and acceptance rate tracking.

2. **Structured Approach**: The 6-step methodology is logical - starting with document analysis, examining existing implementations, reviewing patterns, designing the structure, mapping workflows, and creating technical specifications.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All user requirements are addressed:
   - Share submission monitoring ✓
   - Share format parsing (nonce, hash) ✓
   - Pool response checking (accept/reject) ✓
   - Difficulty target validation ✓
   - Acceptance rate tracking ✓
   - Rejection reason logging ✓
   - All required decisions (share_accepted, share_rejected, shares_validated, error) ✓
   - All required permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) ✓

4. **Strong Test Coverage**: The test considerations cover a wide range of scenarios (valid shares, invalid difficulty, duplicates, stale shares, malformed data, disconnection, high rejection rates) which shows thorough thinking about edge cases.

5. **Technical Depth**: The plan shows understanding of mining-specific concepts (Stratum protocol, difficulty targets, nonce/hash values, hex encoding, compact format).

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence Specificity**: While the evidence list is comprehensive, some items are somewhat generic ("Complete share_validator.json file with all required fields"). However, this is mitigated by the detailed breakdown of what those fields should contain.

2. **Verification Method**: The plan doesn't explicitly state HOW the completed agent will be verified beyond the file existence (e.g., JSON schema validation, syntax checking).

3. **Source Document Dependency**: The plan references "section 2.3 (lines 284-304)" but doesn't account for what happens if that section is missing or incomplete. However, the user request implies this document exists and is accessible.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**

The proposed evidence is concrete and verifiable:
- Complete JSON file at specific path: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/share_validator.json`
- Specific required fields enumerated (systemPrompt, validationCriteria, requiredTools, decisions, configuration)
- Concrete decision keywords that must be present
- Specific Bash commands for operational functionality
- Technical specifications for parsing and validation algorithms
- Integration points with other named agents

The evidence directly maps to the user requirements and provides clear deliverables that can be inspected and validated.

**Confidence Justification**: The "High" confidence rating is well-justified because:
1. Source document (MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.3) exists and provides specifications
2. Existing agent examples demonstrate the JSON schema pattern
3. User requirements are clearly stated and comprehensive
4. The domain knowledge (mining share validation) is well-established

**Minor Concerns**:
- No explicit mention of validating the JSON syntax/structure before delivery
- Could benefit from stating specific acceptance criteria thresholds (though this may be in the source document)

**Overall**: This is a well-thought-out plan with clear understanding, logical structure, comprehensive scope, and strong verifiable evidence. The minor weaknesses don't undermine the fundamental soundness of the approach.
