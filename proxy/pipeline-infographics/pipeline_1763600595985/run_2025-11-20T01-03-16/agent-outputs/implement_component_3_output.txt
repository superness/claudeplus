Excellent! The share_validator agent JSON file has been successfully created. Let me provide a summary of what was built:

## Share Validator Agent - Creation Summary

**File Location**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/share_validator.json`
**File Size**: 14 KB (142 lines)
**JSON Validation**: ✓ Valid

### Agent Specifications

**Core Identity**:
- **ID**: share_validator
- **Role**: validation
- **Group**: mining_cycle_automation
- **Version**: 1.0.0

**Primary Capabilities** (12 expertise areas):
1. Mining share validation and verification
2. Stratum protocol share message parsing
3. Proof-of-work difficulty target validation
4. Share acceptance rate tracking and analysis
5. Pool response monitoring (accept/reject)
6. Share format parsing (nonce, hash, extraNonce)
7. Rejection reason categorization and logging
8. Duplicate and stale share detection
9. Share database management and querying
10. Mining pool log analysis
11. Share submission fraud detection
12. Statistical analysis of share acceptance patterns

**Key Responsibilities** (6 main areas):
1. **Share Submission Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of share submissions with timestamps and frequencies
2. **Share Format Parsing**: Extract worker name, job_id, extranonce2, ntime, nonce from Stratum messages
3. **Pool Response Checking**: Monitor accept/reject responses with error code analysis (20-24)
4. **Difficulty Target Validation**: Calculate share difficulty and validate against target
5. **Share Acceptance Rate Tracking**: Per-worker, per-miner, and time-based statistics
6. **Rejection Reason Logging**: Categorize stale, duplicate, low difficulty, and other rejection types

**Decisions Implemented** (4 outcomes):
- `share_accepted`: Valid share accepted by pool
- `share_rejected`: Share rejected with reason (stale, duplicate, low difficulty, etc.)
- `shares_validated`: Batch validation completed with statistics
- `error`: Critical validation errors encountered

**Required Tools**:
- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

**Configuration Parameters**:
- Validation interval: 5 seconds
- Acceptance rate threshold: 90%
- Max share age: 300 seconds
- Pool response timeout: 10 seconds
- Alert thresholds for low acceptance (85%), high rejection (15%), stale shares (5%)
- Support for 6 mining algorithms (sha256d, scrypt, x11, x13, keccak, quark)

**Integration Points**:
- Dependencies on: pool_server_manager, miner_manager, stratum_monitor, network_monitor
- External services: coiniumserv_pool, share_database

**Validation Criteria** (13 success metrics):
All requirements from section 2.3 are covered, including share monitoring, format parsing, pool response checking, difficulty validation, acceptance rate tracking, and rejection reason logging.

The agent includes comprehensive monitoring commands for:
- Real-time log tailing and grep patterns
- Share acceptance/rejection counting
- Database queries for historical data
- Statistical analysis with awk/sed
