Perfect! Execution complete. Let me provide a final summary:

# 🎮 Game Runner Execution Report

## ✅ Execution Status: COMPLETED

I successfully executed the hover-to-hold RadialHUD feature tests with full environment setup and evidence collection.

### Environment Setup ✓
- **HTTP Server:** Running with `-c-1` flag (no caching) on port 8080
- **Old Chrome Processes:** Killed on port 9222
- **Working Directory:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`
- **Server Verification:** `http://localhost:8080/` returning 200 OK

### Test Execution Results

**6 test cases executed:**
- ✅ **2 PASSED** (33%)
- ❌ **4 FAILED** (67%)

#### ✅ Passing Tests:
1. **TC-003:** RadialHUD opens after 0.5s continuous hover (507.5ms - within tolerance)
2. **TC-008:** Click during hover immediately opens HUD (bypass works)

#### ❌ Failing Tests:
1. **TC-001:** HUD opens after 100ms instead of remaining hidden
2. **TC-002:** Progress indicator shows 0% progress, circle element not found
3. **TC-004:** Progress tracking broken, HUD doesn't hide on cancel
4. **TC-005:** Progress always 0%, HUD stays visible after interruption

### Evidence Captured ✓
- **1,330 console log messages** captured
- **1 console error** (non-critical: ship type not found)
- **0 exceptions**
- **Evidence file:** `hover_hud_test_evidence_1763418050302.json` (55 KB)

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Priority 1:** Progress tracking not functional (`hoverProgress` always 0)
   - Likely cause: `HoverTimerSystem.update()` not called in game loop
   
2. **Priority 2:** Progress circle element not rendering
   - Likely cause: SVG element with class `progress-fill` not created

3. **Priority 3:** HUD opens immediately on hover
   - Likely cause: Old event listeners still active

4. **Priority 4:** HUD doesn't hide when hover cancelled
   - Likely cause: `cancelHover()` not calling `radialHUD.hide()`

### Feature Status: **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What Works:**
- ✅ Hover timer triggers at 0.5s
- ✅ HUD opens after completion
- ✅ Click bypass functional

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ Progress tracking (always 0%)
- ❌ Visual progress indicator
- ❌ Immediate opening prevention
- ❌ Hide on cancellation
