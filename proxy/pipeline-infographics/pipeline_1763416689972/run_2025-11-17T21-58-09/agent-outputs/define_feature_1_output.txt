  "featureName": "Hover-to-Open RadialHUD with Progress Indicator",
  "userStory": "As a player, I want the radial HUD to require a deliberate hover-and-hold action before opening, so that I don't accidentally trigger it when moving my cursor across the screen",
  "description": "Replace the current instant-open behavior of the RadialHUD with a hover-timer system that requires the user to hover over the ship for 0.5 seconds before the menu opens. A visual progress indicator (circular fill or progress bar) will display during the hover, showing the user how much longer they need to hold before the menu opens. If the user moves their cursor away before 0.5 seconds, the timer resets and the menu does not open.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "RadialHUD does NOT open immediately when cursor enters ship hitbox",
    "Timer starts when cursor hovers over ship",
    "Visual progress indicator appears and fills from 0% to 100% over 0.5 seconds",
    "RadialHUD opens only after full 0.5 second hover duration is complete",
    "Timer and progress indicator reset if cursor leaves ship hitbox before completion",
    "Progress indicator is visible and clearly shows completion percentage",
    "No performance degradation during hover tracking",
    "Works across all camera modes and ship types"
  ],
  "scope": {
    "inScope": [
      "Implement 0.5 second hover timer system",
      "Create visual progress indicator (circular fill or progress bar)",
      "Track hover enter/exit events on ship",
      "Reset timer when hover is interrupted",
      "Open RadialHUD only after timer completion",
      "Display progress indicator during hover"
    ],
    "outOfScope": [
      "Configurable hover duration (hardcoded to 0.5s for now)",
      "Multiple progress indicator styles (choose one: circular OR bar)",
      "Hover-to-open for other UI elements",
      "Alternative interaction methods (keyboard shortcuts, etc.)",

    "Rendering (progress indicator visual)"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "Requires access to ship hitbox/mesh for hover detection",
    "Needs raycasting or mouse-over detection system",

  "technicalDetails": {
    "hoverDuration": "0.5 seconds (500ms)",
    "progressIndicatorType": "Circular fill or progress bar (to be determined during implementation)",
    "resetBehavior": "Immediate reset when cursor exits ship hitbox",
    "visualFeedback": "Progress indicator positioned near ship or cursor during hover"
  },
  "edgeCases": [
    "What happens if user hovers for 0.4s, leaves, then hovers again? (Answer: Timer resets, starts from 0)",
    "What if RadialHUD is already open and user hovers again? (Answer: No effect, menu already open)",
    "What if ship is destroyed/warps away during hover? (Answer: Timer cancels, no menu opens)",
    "What if multiple ships overlap under cursor? (Answer: Use existing ship selection logic, apply timer to selected ship)",
    "What if user clicks during hover progress? (Answer: Clicking should immediately open menu OR trigger existing click behavior)",
    "Performance with very low framerate? (Answer: Use timestamp-based timer, not frame-based counter)",
    "What if camera moves ship out of view during hover? (Answer: Cursor no longer over ship, timer cancels)"
