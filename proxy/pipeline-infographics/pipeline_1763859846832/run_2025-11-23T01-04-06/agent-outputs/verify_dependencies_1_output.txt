Perfect! Now let me create a summary output for the user:

## CONFIG_GENERATOR - DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION COMPLETE

### Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the SuperCoinServ mining infrastructure dependencies. The system requires several critical components to function:

**AVAILABLE COMPONENTS:**
- ✓ CoiniumServ Pool Server (pre-built at `build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe`)
- ✓ Complete configuration files (Bitcoin regtest mode ready)
- ✓ .NET SDK 7.0.102 (Windows via WSL - limited use)

**MISSING REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:**

1. **Mono Runtime** (CRITICAL)
   - Status: Not installed
   - Purpose: Execute CoiniumServ.exe pool server
   - Available: Yes, in Ubuntu repositories
   - Install: `sudo apt install -y mono-complete`

2. **Bitcoin Core** (CRITICAL)
   - Status: Not installed
   - Purpose: Blockchain backend for mining
   - Available: Not in default repos (requires PPA or manual install)
   - Install: Requires adding Bitcoin PPA or downloading from bitcoin.org

3. **CPU Miner** (CRITICAL)
   - Status: Not installed  
   - Purpose: Hash generation/mining operations
   - Available: Not in default repos (requires building from source)
   - Install: Must compile cpuminer or cpuminer-multi from source

### Infrastructure Status

The CoiniumServ application and configuration files are present and properly configured for Bitcoin regtest mining (Stratum port 3333, Web UI port 81, targeting RPC at 172.22.45.9:18443). However, the system **cannot run** because it lacks:

- The Mono runtime to execute the pool server
- The Bitcoin daemon to provide blockchain services
- The mining software to generate hashes
