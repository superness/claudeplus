## Summary

I have created a comprehensive **ship movement bug reproduction script** using the game's WebSocket automation framework:

### What Was Created

1. **Enhanced Reproduction Script**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug_enhanced.js`
   - Tests navigation target setting
   - Verifies velocity and position changes
   - **NEW**: Includes manual throttle test to isolate whether bug is in navigation system vs physics engine
   - Comprehensive logging and evidence collection

2. **Existing Script**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`
   - Already exists and tests basic navigation and movement
   - Good foundation but lacks manual throttle isolation test

### Key Features

**Available Commands Used** (all verified in GameTestingInterface.js):
- `listCommands` - Verify automation works
- `getShipState` - Get position, velocity, throttle
- `setNavigationTarget` - Set navigation target (the main test!)
- `setThrottle` - Manual throttle control (isolates bug location)
- `setPosition` - Reset ship position between tests
- `wait` - Local timing command

**Test Sequence**:
1. Get baseline ship state (position, velocity should be 0)
2. Set navigation target 5000m away on X-axis
3. Wait 500ms - check if velocity > 0 (CRITICAL CHECK)
4. Wait 2s total - verify position changed (CRITICAL CHECK)
5. **Enhanced test**: Set manual throttle to 75% and check if that works
   - If manual throttle works but navigation doesn't → bug is in navigation system
   - If both fail → bug is in physics engine

**Root Cause Isolation**:
- The enhanced script can determine if the bug is:
  - Navigation system not triggering physics ✓
  - Physics engine not running at all ✓
  - Movement-blocking flag (docked, paused, etc.) ✓

### How to Run

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships
node reproduce_ship_movement_bug_enhanced.js
```

The script will automatically:
- Start WebSocket server on port 8765
- Launch Chrome with testMode=true
- Execute test sequence
- Save evidence JSON file
- Exit with clear bug reproduced/not reproduced status

**DECISION: script_ready**
