I'll analyze this bug report to create a structured analysis that will guide the debugging and fixing process.

Based on the bug report, this is a critical movement system failure where the player ship is completely non-responsive to navigation commands. Let me create a comprehensive analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship completely non-functional for movement - does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player sets a navigation target (by double-tapping a location or selecting 'Navigate To' on an object), the ship should accelerate toward the target using EVE-style physics and continue moving until it reaches the destination or player issues new commands",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains completely stationary despite navigation targets being set. No movement occurs regardless of tap-to-move commands or navigation target selection. Ship physics engine appears to not be applying any velocity or acceleration changes",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "input_handling",
    "mobile_controls",
    "ship_movement",
    "target_setting"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a browser (index.html)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to fully load with player ship visible",
    "Step 3: Double-tap anywhere in space to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe ship - it should move but remains stationary",
    "Step 5: Alternatively, select an object (asteroid/station) and click 'Navigate To'",
    "Step 6: Observe ship - still no movement occurs"
  ],

    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Multiple possible root causes: 1) Navigation target is being set but not being read by physics update loop (disconnected event flow), 2) Ship physics update method not being called in main game loop, 3) Movement flag/state check preventing physics calculations (e.g., isDocked, isPaused, movementDisabled), 4) Input handler setting navigation target but ship.navigateTo() method not being invoked, 5) Recent changes to mobile input or navigation system broke integration between input → navigation → physics pipeline. Most likely: navigation target is set visually but the ship's physics engine isn't receiving the command or a flag is preventing movement calculations.",
  "additionalContext": {
    "recentChanges": "Git status shows modifications to InputManager.js, Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, and MobileInputManager.js - these recent changes may have introduced the regression",
    "relatedSystems": "This bug affects the core gameplay loop and renders the game unplayable",
    "debuggingApproach": [
      "Add console logging to verify navigation target is being set",
      "Check if ship.update() and physics update methods are being called each frame",
      "Verify no movement-blocking flags are active (paused, docked, disabled)",
      "Trace complete flow: user input → navigation target set → physics calculation → position update",
      "Check for JavaScript errors in browser console that might halt execution"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Analysis Complete**

This is a **CRITICAL** severity bug that makes the game completely unplayable. The ship movement system appears to have a complete breakdown in the pipeline between:
- User input (tap/click) → Navigation target setting → Physics engine → Ship position update

Key investigation areas:
1. **Recent file modifications** - The git status shows changes to core movement files (Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js) which may have introduced this regression
2. **Event flow integrity** - Verify the complete chain: input event → `navigateTo()` call → physics acceleration → velocity update → position change
3. **State flags** - Check for any flags preventing movement (isPaused, isDocked, movementLocked, etc.)
4. **Main game loop** - Confirm physics update is being called every frame
5. **Mobile/Desktop input** - Both mobile touch and desktop mouse input paths need verification

The bug likely originated from recent changes to the movement system, possibly during mobile input integration or navigation refactoring.
