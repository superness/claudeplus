Now I have a complete picture. The code expects `ship.mesh` to exist, but `SceneManager.addShip()` never creates this property. Let me create the verification report:

## Bug Verification Report

### Verification Result: **INCONCLUSIVE**

### Reasoning

The WebSocket automation test **failed before being able to verify the actual ship movement bug** due to a **test infrastructure bug** in the GameTestingInterface.

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ Game initialized successfully (all systems loaded)
2. ✅ Player ship created: "atron"
3. ✅ WebSocket automation connected
4. ❌ First test command `getShipState` crashed immediately
5. ❌ Test aborted - unable to proceed to ship movement verification

**Root Cause of Test Failure:**
The `GameTestingInterface.js:150` attempts to read `ship.mesh.quaternion`, but the Ship object does **not have a `mesh` property**. This is an architectural mismatch:

- **SceneManager.addShip()** creates a Three.js Group (`shipGroup`) but stores it in `this.ships.set(id, {group: shipGroup})` - it never assigns `ship.mesh = shipGroup`
- **GameTestingInterface** expects `ship.mesh` to exist and tries to read rotation from `ship.mesh.quaternion`
- **Result**: TypeError "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion')"

### Evidence Analysis

```json
{
  "runtimeEvidencePresent": true,
  "consoleLogsPresent": false,
  "consoleLogFile": null,
  "consoleErrorCount": 1,
  "consoleExceptionCount": 1,
  "websocketResponses": "Command 1 (getShipState) failed with COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR",
  "consoleErrors": [
    "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion') at GameTestingInterface.js:150:30"
  ],
  "errorCorrelation": "Test infrastructure bug prevented execution of ship movement test",
  "stateInconsistency": "GameTestingInterface expects ship.mesh but SceneManager never creates this property",
  "matchesBugReport": false
}
```

### Console Log Analysis

**Console Log Availability**: ❌ **NOT PRESENT**
- `consoleLogFile`: null
- `consoleLogs`: Not captured in evidence.json
- Console logger may have run but output not integrated into evidence

**Evidence Completeness**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- WebSocket command/response logs: ✅ Present
- Game state snapshots: ❌ Failed before capture
- Runtime execution: ✅ Test script ran
- Console errors: ⚠️ Visible in stack trace but not in structured logs

### Critical Findings

**Test Infrastructure Bug Identified:**
- **File**: `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:150`
- **Issue**: Assumes `ship.mesh` exists but this property is never created
- **Impact**: All ship state queries will fail, blocking automation testing
- **Architectural Issue**: SceneManager stores ship mesh separately from Ship object

**Ship Movement Bug**: ⚠️ **CANNOT VERIFY**
- Test failed before movement commands could be sent
- Unable to confirm if WASD/arrow keys work
- Unable to verify tap-to-move functionality
- No evidence collected about actual movement behavior

### Code Evidence

**GameTestingInterface.js:150** (FAILING CODE):
```javascript
rotation: {
    x: ship.mesh.quaternion.x,  // ← ship.mesh is undefined!
    y: ship.mesh.quaternion.y,
    z: ship.mesh.quaternion.z,
    w: ship.mesh.quaternion.w
}
```

**SceneManager.js:1027** (MISSING ASSIGNMENT):
```javascript
addShip(id, ship) {
    const shipGroup = new THREE.Group();
    // ... creates shipGroup ...
    this.ships.set(id, {
        ship: ship,
        group: shipGroup,  // ← Stored in SceneManager, not on ship object!
        hull: hullMesh,
        engine: engineMesh
    });
    // ❌ MISSING: ship.mesh = shipGroup;
}
```

### Next Steps Required

**Before ship movement bug can be verified:**

1. **Fix GameTestingInterface** to access ship mesh correctly:
   - Option A: Have SceneManager assign `ship.mesh = shipGroup` in addShip()
   - Option B: Change GameTestingInterface to get mesh from `simulator.sceneManager.ships.get(ship.id).group`

2. **Re-run automation test** with fixed interface

3. **Then verify ship movement** with commands like:
   - `setThrottle(1.0)` → wait 2 sec → `getShipState` → check if position changed
   - `navigate(x, y, z)` → wait → `getShipState` → check movement toward target

### Confidence

**Inconclusive Decision Confidence**: 1.0 (certain)
- Test infrastructure is broken (confirmed via code analysis)
- Ship movement bug cannot be verified until infrastructure is fixed
- Evidence clearly shows test failure, not bug reproduction

---

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The test infrastructure has a critical bug (`ship.mesh` undefined) that prevents verification of the reported ship movement bug. The automation framework must be fixed before the actual ship movement functionality can be tested. This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** situation - the test harness itself is broken, not necessarily the feature being tested.
