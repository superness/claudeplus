Excellent! The render() method exists and is correctly implemented. Now let me create the fix summary JSON:

  "fixSummary": "Added SceneManager.render() call in SpaceshipSimulator game loop to restore visual rendering",
  "expectedImpact": "Ship movement will now be visible on screen. WASD, arrow keys, and tap-to-move inputs will translate to visible ship movement. All visual updates (ship position changes, rotation, etc.) will now appear on the canvas.",
  "riskAssessment": "Zero risk - this fix restores critical functionality that was lost during a previous refactoring. The render() method already exists and is correctly implemented. We're simply calling it at the right point in the game loop.",
  "additionalNotes": "The ship physics calculations were working correctly all along - position updates were being calculated and stored in the scene graph. The only issue was that the renderer.render(scene, camera) call was never happening, so the updated scene was never drawn to the canvas. This was a rendering pipeline bug, not an input or physics bug."

```

## Fix Implementation Summary

**Root Cause**: The game loop was refactored to use SpaceshipSimulator's own update loop instead of SceneManager's animate() method. During this refactoring, the critical `render()` call was lost, breaking the rendering pipeline.

**The Problem**:
1. Input system → working ✓
2. Physics calculations → working ✓  
3. Scene graph updates → working ✓
4. **Rendering to canvas → broken ✗**

**The Solution**: 
Added `this.sceneManager.render()` call immediately after `this.sceneManager.update()` in SpaceshipSimulator.js:1832

**Why This Works**:
- `update()` calculates new positions and updates the Three.js scene graph
- `render()` calls `renderer.render(scene, camera)` to draw the scene to canvas
- Without `render()`, changes exist in memory but never appear on screen

**Testing Recommendation**:
Load the game and press W/A/S/D keys - the ship should now visibly move. Tap-to-move should also work. All movement inputs should result in immediate visual feedback.
