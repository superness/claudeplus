Excellent! The fix has been implemented. Let me create the final fix summary:

  "additionalNotes": "The diagnostic logs will show: (1) Thrust input reception, (2) Target velocity calculation, (3) Actual position changes and velocity magnitude every second. This allows verification that the fix works. Original EVE physics work well for space combat at kilometer scales but are too slow for close-up ship viewing. The 10x multiplier was chosen to provide instant visual feedback while maintaining EVE-style gradual acceleration curves."

## Fix Implementation Complete

**Root Cause**: EVE Online physics formulas were mathematically perfect but resulted in imperceptibly slow acceleration (timeConstant = 6.912 seconds for Atron frigate). Ships were actually moving, but only centimeters per second initially, making them appear completely stationary.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Reduced time constant by 10x (changed divisor from 500,000 to 5,000,000)
- Ships now reach 50% speed in ~0.5 seconds instead of ~5 seconds
- Maintains authentic EVE exponential acceleration curves, just scaled for better gameplay
- Added comprehensive diagnostic logging to verify fix and track movement

**Files Modified**:
- `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js` (line 30 - primary fix, plus diagnostic logging throughout)

**Testing**: Open the game in browser and press WASD or tap to move. Ships should now respond immediately with visible acceleration. Console logs will show thrust input, target velocity, and position changes every 1-2 seconds for verification.
