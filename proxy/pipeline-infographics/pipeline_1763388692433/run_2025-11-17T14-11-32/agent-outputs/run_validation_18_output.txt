Perfect! Now let me compile the final execution report:

## Ship Movement Bug Reproduction Test - Execution Report

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Dev server running: HTTP 200 on http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Chrome console logger started: PID 171088
- ✅ Console log file created: `/mnt/c/Users/super/AppData/Local/Temp/ChromeTestProfile_1763390073352/chrome_debug.log`
- ✅ WebSocket automation server started: Port 8765
- ✅ Game client connected to automation server
- ✅ Test client connected to automation server

### Test Execution Summary
- **Script**: `reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`
- **Exit Code**: 1 (Bug reproduced)
- **Evidence File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763390120192.json`
- **Console Logs Captured**: 203+ entries
- **JavaScript Errors Found**: 4 errors

### Console Errors Detected
1. **ERROR**: Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT
2. **ERROR**: Registration response error message: PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR
3. **ERROR**: Error code: 401 - Authentication Failed: wrong_secret
4. **CONSOLE ERROR**: Uncaught TypeError: window.simulator.objectGrid.updateDisplay is not a function (at ScrollingHeaderFix.js:363)

### Test Sequence Executed
1. ✅ Get initial ship state - Position: (0, 0, 0), Velocity: (0, 0, 0)
2. ✅ Set throttle to 50%
3. ✅ Wait 1 second
4. ✅ Get post-throttle state - Position: (0, 0, 0), Velocity: (0, 0, 0), Throttle: 0.5
5. ✅ Reset throttle to 0%
6. ✅ Set navigation target to (5000, 0, 5000) - Distance: 7071m, Mode: approach
7. ✅ Wait 3 seconds
8. ✅ Get post-navigation state - Position: (0, 0, 0), Velocity: (0, 0, 0)

### Bug Evidence Analysis

**Initial State**:
- Position: (0, 0, 0)
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0)
- Throttle: 0

**After Throttle Set to 50% (1 second elapsed)**:
- Position: (0, 0, 0) - NO CHANGE
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0) - NO CHANGE
- Throttle: 0.5 (command accepted but not applied to physics)
- **Issue Detected**: "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"

**After Navigation Target Set (3 seconds elapsed)**:
- Position: (0, 0, 0) - NO CHANGE
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0) - NO CHANGE
- Distance Moved: 0.00 meters
- Navigation Target: (5000, 0, 5000) at 7071m distance

### Bug Reproduction Confirmed

**Status**: BUG_REPRODUCED

**Bug Details from Evidence**:
- **Issue**: Ship position did not change after setNavigationTarget command
- **Distance Moved**: 0.00 meters
- **Expected Behavior**: Ship should have moved toward target (5000, 0, 5000)
- **Actual Behavior**: Ship remained completely stationary (moved only 0.00m)

### Key Observations

1. **Throttle Commands Accepted**: The game successfully accepted throttle commands (50% → 0%) but did not translate them to velocity changes
2. **Navigation Commands Accepted**: Navigation target was successfully set with correct distance calculation (7071m)
3. **Zero Movement**: Despite 4+ seconds of simulation time (1s throttle + 3s navigation), ship position remained at origin (0, 0, 0)
4. **Zero Velocity**: Ship velocity remained (0, 0, 0) throughout entire test, indicating physics engine is not applying thrust
5. **Console Logs Show Initialization**: All game systems initialized successfully (SpaceshipSimulator, ShipPhysics, InputManager, etc.)
6. **No Physics Calculation Errors**: No console errors related to ShipPhysics calculations

### Evidence Files Generated

1. **ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763390120192.json** (6.0 KB):
   - Complete command sequence and responses
   - Initial/post-throttle/post-navigation states
   - Bug reproduction status and details
   - All position, velocity, and throttle data

2. **Console Log** (203+ entries):
   - Complete game initialization sequence
   - WebSocket automation framework connection logs
   - JavaScript error for objectGrid.updateDisplay
   - GCM authentication errors (unrelated to ship movement)

### Conclusion

The ship movement bug was successfully reproduced. The automation framework, Chrome console logging, and test execution all functioned correctly. The bug evidence confirms that:

1. **Input Layer Works**: Commands are received and acknowledged
2. **Physics Layer Broken**: Throttle/navigation commands do not translate to velocity or position changes
3. **Rendering Layer Unknown**: Ship remains at (0, 0, 0), cannot determine if rendering is the issue or if physics genuinely produces no movement

**Next Steps**: The fix implemented in ShipPhysics.js (reducing time constant from 500,000 to 5,000,000 divisor) should be validated by re-running this test to verify ships now move when navigation targets are set.
