Let me format the execution report with the observable facts:

## Ship Movement Bug Validation Test Execution Report

### Execution Status
- **Exit Code**: 0 (Test executed successfully, bug status determined)
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:8080
- **Console Logger**: Started successfully (PID 169239), later stopped
- **WebSocket Server**: Started successfully on port 8765
- **Game Connection**: Connected successfully
- **Test Client Connection**: Connected successfully

### Test Sequence Executed
The script executed 9 automation commands successfully:

1. **getShipState** (initial) - Captured baseline ship state
2. **setThrottle** (50%) - Set throttle to 50%
3. **wait** (1000ms) - Waited for throttle to apply
4. **getShipState** (post-throttle) - Verified throttle state
5. **setThrottle** (0%) - Reset throttle
6. **wait** (500ms) - Brief pause
7. **setNavigationTarget** (5000, 0, 5000) - Set navigation target at 7071m distance
8. **wait** (3000ms) - Waited 3 seconds for ship movement
9. **getShipState** (final) - Captured final ship state

### Evidence Collected

**File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763389735984.json`

**Initial State**:
- Position: (0, 0, 0)
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0)
- Throttle: 0

**Post-Throttle State** (after 50% throttle + 1 second):
- Position: (0, 0, 0) - unchanged
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0) - unchanged
- Throttle: 0.5 - correctly set

**Navigation Target**:
- Coordinates: (5000, 0, 5000)
- Distance: 7071m
- Mode: approach
- Command Status: success

**Post-Navigation State** (after 3 seconds):
- Position: (0, 0, 0) - unchanged
- Velocity: (0, 0, 0) - unchanged
- Distance Moved: 0m
- Final Velocity Magnitude: 0 m/s

### Test Result

**Status**: `BUG_REPRODUCED`

**Bug Details**:
- Issue: Ship position did not change after setNavigationTarget command
- Distance Moved: 0.00m
- Expected Behavior: Ship should have moved toward target (5000, 0, 5000)
- Actual Behavior: Ship remained stationary (moved 0m)

### Console Output Observations

The console logs captured from the test execution show:
- Game systems initialized successfully (150+ console log entries)
- All core systems loaded: SceneManager, InputManager, HUDManager, ResourceManager, etc.
- WebSocket automation framework connected successfully
- Test mode enabled via URL parameter `?testMode=true`
- TestingBrowserBridge connected and registered
- All automation commands executed successfully (no command failures)
- One JavaScript error detected: `TypeError: window.simulator.objectGrid.updateDisplay is not a function` (unrelated to ship movement)

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Game dev server operational
- ✅ Console logger operational
- ✅ WebSocket server operational
- ✅ Browser launch successful
- ✅ Game-server connection established
- ✅ Test client connection established
- ✅ Command execution successful (9/9 commands)
- ✅ Evidence file generated with complete data

### Critical Findings

**Throttle System Behavior**:
- Setting throttle to 50% succeeded (command returned success)
- Throttle value stored correctly (0.5 in ship state)
- **But**: Velocity remained at (0, 0, 0) after 1 second - no acceleration occurred

**Navigation System Behavior**:
- setNavigationTarget command succeeded (returned success)
- Navigation target set to (5000, 0, 5000) at 7071m distance
- **But**: After 3 seconds, ship position remained at (0, 0, 0) - no movement toward target

**Root Issue Confirmed**:
The evidence confirms the critical bug: Input commands (throttle control, navigation target) are **accepted by the game** but **do not result in ship movement**. The ship state shows commands are processed (throttle value changes), but physics integration appears broken (velocity never changes from zero).
