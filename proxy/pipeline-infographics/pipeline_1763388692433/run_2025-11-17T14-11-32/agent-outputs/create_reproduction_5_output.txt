Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and is comprehensive. Let me output the final decision with the script details:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptContent": "Comprehensive Node.js reproduction script with WebSocket server that:\n1. Starts automation server on port 8765\n2. Launches Chrome with game URL including ?testMode=true parameter\n3. Connects both game client and test client to server\n4. Executes 12-step test sequence to reproduce ship movement bug\n5. Tests both manual throttle control and navigation waypoint movement\n6. Saves detailed evidence to ship_movement_bug_evidence_{timestamp}.json",
  "commandSequence": [
    {
      "command": "listCommands",
      "expectedResult": "List of available automation commands"
    },

      "expectedResult": "Initial ship position, velocity, and throttle recorded"
    },
    {
      "command": "setThrottle",
      "params": {"value": 50},
      "expectedResult": "Throttle set to 50%"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 1000},
      "expectedResult": "Wait 1 second for throttle to apply"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",

      "params": {"x": 5000, "y": 0, "z": 5000, "mode": "approach"},

    },
    {

    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "BUG DETECTION: Ship position should have moved significantly (>10m) from initial position, velocity should be non-zero. If distance moved <10m or velocity <0.1, bug is reproduced."

    }
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": [
    "ship_movement_bug_evidence_{timestamp}.json - Contains complete test execution data including all commands, responses, initial/post-throttle/post-navigation states, distance moved, velocity magnitudes, and bug reproduction status"
  ],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug is reproduced when:\n1. Ship position does not change (<10m movement) after setNavigationTarget command despite 3 seconds of navigation time, OR\n2. Ship velocity remains near zero (<0.1 m/s) after setNavigationTarget command, indicating navigation system is not applying thrust\n\nThe script captures detailed evidence including:\n- Initial ship position and velocity\n- Post-throttle state (to verify acceleration system)\n- Post-navigation state (to verify navigation system)\n- Distance moved from start\n- Final velocity magnitude\n- Complete command/response log\n\nExit codes:\n- 0: Bug reproduced OR bug not reproduced (both success cases)\n- 1: Test error (connection failure, command failure, etc.)",
  "executionInstructions": "To run the script:\n1. Ensure game server is running on http://localhost:8080\n2. Ensure Node.js and ws package are installed (npm install ws)\n3. Run: node reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js\n4. Script will automatically:\n   - Start WebSocket server on port 8765\n   - Launch Chrome with game in test mode\n   - Wait for connections\n   - Execute test sequence\n   - Save evidence JSON file\n   - Exit with appropriate code\n5. Check the evidence JSON file for detailed results"
}
```

**DECISION: script_ready**
