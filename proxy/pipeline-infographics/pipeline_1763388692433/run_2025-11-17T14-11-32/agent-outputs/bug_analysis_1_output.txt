Based on my analysis of the ship movement bug, here's my structured bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship movement completely non-functional - navigation commands and manual thrust inputs not translating to actual ship movement on screen despite input being registered",
  "expectedBehavior": "When user presses WASD keys, arrow keys, or uses tap-to-move inputs, the ship should move in the corresponding direction on screen. Navigation commands (double-click, tap-to-navigate) should cause the ship to move toward the target location.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary on screen despite user input. Input is being registered (console logs show thrust magnitude, navigation targets being set) but the ship's visual position does not change.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "InputManager",
    "ShipPhysics",
    "Ship entity",
    "SceneManager rendering",
    "Navigation system"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Load the game in a browser (navigate to index.html)",
    "Step 2: Press W key or arrow up to apply forward thrust",
    "Step 3: Observe ship on screen - it should move forward but remains stationary",
    "Step 4: Double-click on empty space to set navigation waypoint",
    "Step 5: Observe console logs show 'Navigation target set' and thrust being applied",
    "Step 6: Observe ship visual does not move toward waypoint despite physics calculations running"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/SceneManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The bug likely exists in the data flow chain from input → physics calculation → visual rendering. Based on extensive debug logging in the code, the input system and physics calculations appear to be working (thrust magnitude, navigation targets, velocity calculations are all logged). The most probable root cause is a disconnection between the Ship physics position updates and the SceneManager's rendering of the ship mesh. Specifically, Ship.js updates `this.physics.position` via `updatePhysics()`, but the SceneManager may not be properly syncing the 3D mesh position from the physics position. Another possibility is that the velocity is being calculated but the position integration step (`updatePosition()` in ShipPhysics.js) is not being called or is receiving zero deltaTime."
