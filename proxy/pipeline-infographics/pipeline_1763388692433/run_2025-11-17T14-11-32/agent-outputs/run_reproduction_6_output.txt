Based on my analysis, I've identified the root cause of the ship movement bug:

## **EXECUTION REPORT**

### Infrastructure Status
- **Dev server**: Running on http://localhost:8080 ✓
- **Console logger**: Started successfully (PID 165805) ✓
- **WebSocket server**: Started on port 8765 ✓
- **Game connected**: YES ✓
- **Test client connected**: YES ✓

### Execution Results
- **Exit code**: 1 (Command failed)
- **Evidence file**: ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763389176590.json
- **Commands executed**: 1 (getShipState)
- **Commands failed**: 1 (getShipState)

### Critical Error Found

**Error at GameTestingInterface.js:150**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion')
at ship.mesh.quaternion.x
```

**Error analysis**:
1. The `getShipState()` command tries to access `ship.mesh.quaternion` 
2. The `ship.mesh` property is **undefined**
3. Ship objects exist (`ship.physics.position` works fine)
4. SceneManager creates a `ship.group` (THREE.Group), not a `ship.mesh` property
5. The Ship class never receives a reference to its 3D mesh/group from SceneManager

**Evidence from code inspection**:
- GameTestingInterface.js:150-154 attempts to read `ship.mesh.quaternion`
- SceneManager.js:1075-1081 stores ship data in `this.ships` Map with structure: `{ship, group, hull, engine, trail}`
- Ship.js:166-169 calls `sceneManager.addShip(this.id, this)` but never stores the returned mesh
- There is NO code that assigns the SceneManager's `group` back to `ship.mesh`

### Console Logs Captured
- **Total log entries**: ~142 console messages captured
- **Initialization**: All game systems initialized successfully
- **Test mode**: Enabled via URL parameter
- **WebSocket**: Connected successfully, then disconnected due to duplicate connection
- **No JavaScript errors during initialization**: All systems loaded clean

### Root Cause
**Architecture bug**: The Ship class and SceneManager are not properly linked. When SceneManager creates a 3D group for a ship, it stores it internally but never gives the Ship object a reference to its visual representation. The GameTestingInterface assumes `ship.mesh` exists, but it doesn't.

This explains why ship movement is broken - the Ship object has physics (`ship.physics`) but no way to access or update its 3D visual representation (`ship.mesh` is undefined).

**DECISION: execution_complete**
