### Test Execution Results

**Test Sequence**: Ship movement bug reproduction

**Command Execution**:
1. **Command**: `getShipState` (initial state check)
   - **Result**: FAILED
   - **Error Code**: `COMMAND_EXECUTION_ERROR`
   - **Error Message**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion')"
   - **Stack Trace**: TypeError at GameTestingInterface.js:150:30

### Evidence Captured

**Evidence File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763388882940.json`
- **Status**: COMMAND_FAILED
- **Timestamp**: 2025-11-17T14:14:42.940Z
- **Commands Logged**: 1 (getShipState)

### Console Log Analysis

**Console logger output captured**: 150+ lines of console logs  
**Console errors found**: 0 JavaScript runtime errors before command execution  
**Game initialization**: Successful - all systems initialized correctly  

**Game initialization logs show**:
- ✅ All core systems initialized (Economy, Navigation, Factions, etc.)
- ✅ Ship creation successful: "Player ship created: atron"
- ✅ 5 AI ships created
- ✅ Environment and stations generated
- ✅ Test mode enabled successfully
- ✅ WebSocket connection established

### Critical Error

**Location**: `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:150:30`  
**Error Type**: TypeError  
**Error Details**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion')  
**Context**: Error occurs when `getShipState` command attempts to access ship mesh properties

**Call Stack**:
```
GameTestingInterface.getShipState (js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:150:30)
GameTestingInterface.handleCommand (js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:93:34)
TestingBrowserBridge.handleCommand (js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js:148:55)
TestingBrowserBridge.handleMessage (js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js:92:28)
```

### Observations

1. Dev server confirmed running on http://localhost:8080
2. Chrome console logger started successfully (PID 164311)
3. Console logs captured successfully (150+ log entries)
4. WebSocket server started successfully on port 8765
5. Game connected to automation server
6. Test client connected successfully
7. Game initialization completed without errors
8. Player ship object created: "Player ship created: atron"
9. First automation command `getShipState` failed immediately
10. Error indicates ship mesh quaternion property is undefined
11. Test terminated after first command failure
12. Evidence file generated with error details
13. Script exited with code 1 (command execution failure)

### Root Cause Indication

The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'quaternion')" at GameTestingInterface.js:150 indicates that the ship mesh object is undefined when the testing interface attempts to read its rotation. This suggests the ship's Three.js mesh object is not properly initialized or accessible when the `getShipState` command is executed.
