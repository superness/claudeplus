  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug report describing broken functionality. The user explicitly states 'Bug Report' and describes a specific problem: fitted items don't persist across page refreshes. The expected behavior (items should persist) is not happening, which is the definition of a bug. The request includes investigation, fix implementation, and testing - all typical bug fix activities.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Bug Report: Items fitted to the ship are not persisting when the webpage is refreshed. The user can fit items to their ship, but when they refresh the browser, those fitted items are lost and the ship returns to its default state. This indicates a problem with either: 1) not saving the fitted items to localStorage/storage, 2) not loading the fitted items from storage on page load, or 3) the fitted items data structure not being properly serialized/deserialization. Please investigate the ship fitting persistence code, identify why fitted items aren't being saved across page refreshes, implement a fix to properly save and restore fitted items, and create a test to verify the fix works.",
