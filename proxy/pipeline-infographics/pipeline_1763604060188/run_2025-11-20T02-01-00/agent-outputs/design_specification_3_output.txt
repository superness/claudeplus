UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a comprehensive log_analyzer agent JSON specification based on section 2.4 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to parse and analyze logs from bitcoind (debug.log), CoiniumServ pool server, and mining software, identify errors/warnings, correlate events across different log sources, and generate unified timelines. The agent should output to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json with specific decisions: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error.

APPROACH: I will design a complete agent specification following the established pattern from existing agents (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager) while incorporating the specific requirements from section 2.4 of the plan. The agent will need to handle multiple log sources, perform pattern matching, event correlation, timeline generation, and support the required decisions for pipeline integration.

STEPS:
1) Read section 2.4 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (already completed - lines 406-426)
2) Examine existing log_analyzer.json in build/bin/Debug/config/agents/ (already completed - basic structure exists)
3) Review bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and pool_server_manager.json to understand the agent JSON schema pattern (already completed)
4) Identify log file locations: bitcoind debug.log (~/.bitcoin/regtest/debug.log), CoiniumServ logs (build/bin/Debug/logs/), miner output locations
5) Design the complete agent JSON with:
   - Comprehensive configuration for all log sources (bitcoind, CoiniumServ, miner)
   - Log parsing capabilities with regex patterns for errors/warnings
   - Event correlation logic across multiple log sources
   - Timeline generation functionality
   - Decision outputs: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error
   - RPC endpoints for log queries
   - Error pattern definitions for each component
   - Dependencies on other agents (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager)
6) Include helper script references (parse-logs.sh) even though they don't exist yet
7) Add comprehensive error handling and logging configuration
8) Include metrics collection for log analysis performance

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Test with empty log files (no logs available scenario) → should return logs_analyzed with no_errors
- Test with bitcoind debug.log containing RPC errors → should detect errors and return errors_found
- Test with CoiniumServ logs containing stratum connection failures → should identify and correlate
- Test with miner output showing share rejections → should parse and flag warnings
- Test correlation across logs (e.g., daemon RPC error correlated with pool connection failure) → should create unified timeline showing cause-effect
- Test with very large log files (100MB+) → should handle efficiently with pagination/streaming
- Test with missing log files → should report which logs are unavailable
- Test with malformed log entries → should skip invalid entries gracefully
- Test real-time log monitoring vs historical analysis modes
- Test decision routing: logs_analyzed → successful parse, errors_found → critical issues detected, no_errors → clean logs, error → agent failure

EVIDENCE:
- Complete JSON agent specification file at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json
- Agent will include specific log file paths based on actual system layout (verified ~/.bitcoin/regtest/debug.log exists)
- Configuration sections for each log source (bitcoind, CoiniumServ, miner)
- Error pattern arrays with regex patterns for each component type
- Event correlation rules with cross-log matching
- Timeline output format specification
- All four required decisions defined: logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error
- RPC endpoints for querying parsed logs, searching patterns, generating reports
- Dependencies correctly mapped to bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager
- Helper script references to parse-logs.sh for extensibility

CONFIDENCE: High - I have clear requirements from section 2.4, existing agent patterns to follow from bitcoin_daemon_manager.json and pool_server_manager.json, verified log file locations, and understand the mining cycle components. The agent specification will be comprehensive and follow the established schema while incorporating all required capabilities for log analysis across the full mining stack.
