UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a log_analyzer agent based on section 2.4 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to parse and analyze logs from multiple sources (bitcoind debug.log, CoiniumServ logs, miner output), identify errors/warnings, correlate events, and generate a unified timeline. The agent definition must be written as a JSON file to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.4 specifications
2. Examine the existing agent structure by looking at other agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory
3. Identify the log file locations for bitcoind, CoiniumServ, and miners from the codebase
4. Design the agent JSON with appropriate tools (Read, Grep, Bash), permissions, and decision points
5. Structure the agent to handle log parsing, error detection, event correlation, and timeline generation
6. Write the complete agent JSON configuration file

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md: `pattern: "**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md"`
2) Use Read to examine section 2.4 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md for detailed specifications
3) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files: `pattern: "**/claudeplus/agents/*.json"`
4) Use Read to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand the structure, format, and patterns
5) Use Grep to search for log file paths in the codebase: `pattern: "debug\.log|\.log"` with appropriate filters
6) Use Grep to find CoiniumServ logging configuration: `pattern: "log|Log|logging" type: "cs"`
7) Design the agent JSON structure including:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Tool permissions (Read, Grep, Bash)
   - Decision points (logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error)
   - Prompt instructions for log parsing, error identification, correlation, and timeline generation
8) Use Write to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/log_analyzer.json with the complete agent definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will ensure the agent can handle missing log files (bitcoind not running, CoiniumServ not started)
- Will design error handling for corrupted or incomplete log entries
- Will account for different log formats across components
- Will test correlation logic with asynchronous events across different logs
- Will handle large log files efficiently (using Grep with filters rather than reading entire files)
- Will validate that all four decision points (logs_analyzed, errors_found, no_errors, error) are properly defined and reachable
- Will ensure the agent can generate meaningful timelines even with partial log data

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the contents of section 2.4 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will reference the structure of existing agent JSON files
- Will document the identified log file locations from the codebase
- Will provide the complete log_analyzer.json file content
- Will verify the JSON is valid and contains all required fields (tools, permissions, decisions, prompt)
- Will confirm the file is written to the correct path

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a well-defined task with clear requirements. The challenge is ensuring the agent design properly handles the complexity of multi-source log correlation and timeline generation. Success depends on understanding the existing agent framework structure and the actual log formats used by bitcoind, CoiniumServ, and miners. The provided permissions and decision points give clear boundaries for the agent's capabilities.
