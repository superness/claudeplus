UNDERSTANDING: The user wants me to create a PLAN for building the cycle_integration_tester agent based on section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent needs to perform end-to-end validation of the complete mining cycle (daemon → pool → miner → share → block → wallet), execute test sequences, coordinate components, set low difficulty, monitor the entire flow, collect evidence, and generate comprehensive reports. The output should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json. I've examined an existing version of this agent and can see the structure and approach used.

APPROACH: I will analyze section 2.3 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document (lines 258-353), examine the existing cycle_integration_tester.json agent structure, review related validation agents (block_validator, share_validator, performance_analyzer) to understand the agent JSON schema patterns, then create a comprehensive plan for building the complete agent specification that includes all required capabilities, proper decision points (cycle_complete, cycle_passed, cycle_failed, error), and integration with other mining infrastructure agents.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine the existing cycle_integration_tester.json at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json (already completed above - lines 1-21)
2) Use Read tool to examine related agents (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager) to understand their interfaces and capabilities
3) Use Grep tool with pattern "decision|DECISION" in existing agents to understand decision routing patterns used
4) Design the complete agent JSON structure including:
   - Agent metadata (name, type, version, description)
   - System prompt with full cycle orchestration instructions
   - Configuration section (difficulty settings, timeouts, evidence collection paths)
   - Responsibilities array (execute sequence, coordinate components, monitor flow, collect evidence, generate reports)
   - Dependencies on other agents (daemon_manager, pool_manager, miner_manager, validators)
   - Decision points (cycle_complete, cycle_passed, cycle_failed, error)
   - Test stages/checkpoints (infrastructure setup, job delivery, share submission, block discovery, reward maturity)
   - Evidence collection specifications
   - Report generation templates
5) Use Write tool to create the complete agent JSON at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Agent must handle all 4 required decision states: cycle_complete, cycle_passed, cycle_failed, error
- Must validate edge cases: daemon startup failures, RPC connection issues, stratum connection failures, no jobs delivered, all shares rejected, block submission failures, orphaned blocks, wallet crediting issues
- Must set appropriately low difficulty for regtest to enable fast block discovery (10-60 seconds target)
- Must implement proper timeouts for each stage (daemon start: 5s, pool start: 10s, miner connection: 2s, block discovery: 300s)
- Must collect evidence at ALL checkpoints: daemon status, pool logs, miner output, RPC traces, stratum messages, block data, wallet transactions
- Must coordinate dependencies on bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager, share_validator, block_validator
- Must generate comprehensive report with markdown format including test config, execution summary, checkpoint results, evidence attachments, issues, and conclusion
- Must validate complete cycle: daemon→pool→miner→shares→block→maturity→wallet credit

EVIDENCE: 
- Complete agent JSON file written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json
- Agent JSON will contain all required fields from schema: agent_name, agent_type, version, description, systemPrompt
- systemPrompt will include detailed instructions for all 6 test stages and checkpoint validations
- Configuration section will specify difficulty, timeouts, logging levels, evidence paths
- Decision routing will include all 4 required decisions with clear transition criteria
- Dependencies section will list all required agents
- Outputs section will define events and metrics
- Test execution workflow will be fully documented in systemPrompt
- Evidence collection procedures will be specified for each checkpoint
- Report generation template will be included

CONFIDENCE: High - I have examined section 2.3 of the plan document (lines 331-353), reviewed the existing agent structure, examined related validation agents, and understand the complete mining cycle flow. The requirements are clearly specified and the agent schema is well-established from other mining agents in the codebase.
