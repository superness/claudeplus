**ASSESSMENT:**

This is an extremely thorough and well-structured plan for building the cycle_integration_tester agent. Let me evaluate each critical dimension:

**Understanding of Requirements:** ✓ EXCELLENT
- Clearly identified all 6 core capabilities: end-to-end validation, test sequence execution, component coordination, difficulty configuration, monitoring, evidence collection, and report generation
- Correctly identified all 4 required decision states: cycle_complete, cycle_passed, cycle_failed, error
- Properly scoped the complete mining cycle flow: daemon→pool→miner→shares→block→maturity→wallet credit
- Referenced the authoritative source document (section 2.3, lines 258-353 and 331-353)

**Logical Approach:** ✓ STRONG
- Step 1: Examined existing agent structure (already completed)
- Step 2: Review related agents to understand interfaces (bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager)
- Step 3: Grep for decision routing patterns across existing agents
- Step 4: Design complete agent JSON with all required sections (metadata, systemPrompt, config, responsibilities, dependencies, decisions, stages, evidence, reports)
- Step 5: Write the complete agent JSON file

The sequence is logical and builds incrementally from understanding existing patterns to creating the new agent.

**Concrete Evidence Specifications:** ✓ COMPREHENSIVE
The plan specifies multiple concrete verification points:
1. **File Existence:** Complete agent JSON at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json
2. **Schema Compliance:** All required fields (agent_name, agent_type, version, description, systemPrompt)
3. **Content Verification:**
   - systemPrompt includes all 6 test stages with checkpoint validations
   - Configuration section with difficulty, timeouts, logging, evidence paths
   - All 4 decision routes with clear transition criteria
   - Dependencies list for all required agents
   - Outputs section with events/metrics
   - Evidence collection procedures for each checkpoint
   - Report generation template

**Test Considerations:** ✓ EXCEPTIONALLY DETAILED
The plan demonstrates deep thinking about edge cases:
- Daemon startup failures, RPC connection issues
- Stratum connection failures, no jobs delivered
- Share rejection scenarios, block submission failures
- Orphaned blocks, wallet crediting issues
- Specific timeout values (daemon: 5s, pool: 10s, miner: 2s, block: 300s)
- Low difficulty settings for regtest (10-60 second block targets)
- Evidence collection at ALL checkpoints
- Proper dependency coordination across 5+ agents

**Confidence Justification:** ✓ WELL-FOUNDED
High confidence is justified because:
- Examined authoritative planning document (section 2.3)
- Reviewed existing agent structure
- Examined related validation agents
- Understands established agent schema patterns
- Complete mining cycle flow is well-documented

**Potential Concerns:**
1. The plan mentions examining lines "258-353" and "331-353" of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md - slight inconsistency in line numbers, but both reference section 2.3
2. No explicit mention of validating JSON syntax after writing (minor - could be implicit)
3. Step 2 could specify which specific interface fields/patterns to examine from related agents

These are minor concerns that don't fundamentally undermine the plan's soundness.

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY:** Strong

The proposed evidence is:
- **Specific:** Named file path, enumerated fields, documented sections
- **Verifiable:** Can check file existence, parse JSON, validate schema compliance
- **Comprehensive:** Covers structure (schema), content (systemPrompt details), functionality (decision routing), and integration (dependencies)
- **Measurable:** Each evidence item can be objectively verified

The only minor weakness is lack of explicit JSON validation testing, but this is a minor gap.

**DECISION:** APPROVED

**Justification:**
1. ✓ Crystal clear understanding - all requirements identified with authoritative references
2. ✓ Logical step-by-step approach - builds from existing patterns to new implementation
3. ✓ Concrete, verifiable evidence - multiple specific verification points across structure, content, and functionality
4. ✓ High confidence with strong reasoning - justified by document review, existing code analysis, and domain understanding

The plan demonstrates exceptional thoroughness with detailed edge case analysis, specific timeout values, comprehensive evidence collection strategy, and proper integration considerations. The test considerations section alone shows deep thinking about failure modes and validation requirements. This plan will provide solid proof of completion.

DECISION: APPROVED
