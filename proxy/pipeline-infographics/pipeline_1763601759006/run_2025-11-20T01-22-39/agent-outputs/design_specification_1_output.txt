UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a detailed plan for building the `cycle_integration_tester` agent based on section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will perform end-to-end full mining cycle validation by executing a complete test sequence, coordinating all components, monitoring the entire flow, and generating comprehensive reports.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.3 requirements
2. Examine existing agent structures to maintain consistency with the agent framework
3. Design the agent JSON structure with appropriate permissions, decisions, and prompts
4. Create detailed instructions covering all requirements: component coordination, low difficulty setup, flow monitoring, evidence collection, and comprehensive reporting
5. Write the complete agent JSON file to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` to understand section 2.3 specifications
2) Use Glob tool to find existing agent JSON files: `agents/*.json` to understand the agent structure pattern
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example agent files to understand the JSON schema and structure
4) Design the agent JSON with:
   - Meta information (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decisions array: ["cycle_complete", "cycle_passed", "cycle_failed", "error"]
   - Comprehensive prompt covering:
     * End-to-end full mining cycle validation workflow
     * Complete test sequence execution steps
     * Component coordination (daemon, pool, miner)
     * Low difficulty configuration for fast block generation
     * Monitoring entire flow from start to block confirmation
     * Evidence collection at each stage (daemon logs, pool status, block data, payment processing)
     * Comprehensive report generation with all collected evidence
5) Use Write tool to create `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/cycle_integration_tester.json` with the complete agent definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- The agent design will need to handle scenarios where components fail to start
- Must account for timeout scenarios if blocks don't generate quickly enough
- Should handle cases where evidence collection fails at any stage
- Need to validate that low difficulty settings are properly applied
- Must handle partial success scenarios (e.g., block mined but payment fails)
- Should provide clear error reporting when any component fails
- Need to ensure cleanup happens even if test fails mid-execution

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the contents of section 2.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will display example agent JSON structure from existing agents
- Will provide the complete cycle_integration_tester.json file content
- Will verify the file is written to the correct path
- Will show how the agent structure aligns with the requirements (permissions, decisions, workflow steps)

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a clear task to create an agent JSON file based on documented specifications. I have access to the plan document, can examine existing agent patterns, and have all necessary tools to read, design, and write the agent file.
