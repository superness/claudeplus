The request includes exact file location (StationUI.js:1605), line numbers (1450, 1605), function names (autoFitItem), and error symptoms (game throws error when double-clicking inventory items). This is clearly a broken feature that needs repair, not a new feature or code improvement.",

    "originalRequest": "Bug fix required: When double-clicking an item in the inventory via the fitting UI, the game throws an error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')' at StationUI.js:1605 in the autoFitItem function. The error occurs at line 1450 where the double-click handler calls autoFitItem. The issue appears to be that the ship object is undefined when autoFitItem tries to access ship.hull. Please investigate the autoFitItem function and its double-click handler, identify why the ship object is not being passed or initialized correctly, and fix the issue so that double-clicking items properly fits them to the ship.",
