## EVIDENCE

**Pipeline Created Successfully**

✅ **File Location**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/mining-infrastructure-setup.json`

✅ **All 8 Stages Present with Correct Manager Assignments**:
1. **verify_dependencies** → config_generator ✓
2. **generate_configs** → bitcoin_daemon_manager ✓
3. **start_daemon** → wallet_manager ✓
4. **fund_wallet** → pool_server_manager ✓
5. **start_pool** → daemon_pool_connector ✓
6. **verify_pool_daemon** → miner_manager ✓
7. **configure_miner** → network_monitor ✓
8. **infrastructure_ready** → network_monitor (final validation) ✓

✅ **Sequential Flow with Proper Transitions**:
- verify_dependencies → generate_configs (on dependencies_ok)
- generate_configs → start_daemon (on configs_generated)
- start_daemon → fund_wallet (on daemon_started)
- fund_wallet → start_pool (on wallet_funded)
- start_pool → verify_pool_daemon (on pool_started)
- verify_pool_daemon → configure_miner (on connection_verified)
- configure_miner → infrastructure_ready (on miner_configured)
- infrastructure_ready → END (on complete)

✅ **Pipeline Structure**:
- Pipeline ID: mining-infrastructure-setup
- Category: infrastructure
- Type: sequential
- Includes proper error handling with pipeline termination conditions
- Each stage has appropriate decisions (success/failure paths)
- Metadata includes WSL requirement and estimated time

✅ **JSON Validity**: File is syntactically correct JSON following the established schema pattern from other pipeline templates (feature-development-v1.json format)

The mining-infrastructure-setup pipeline JSON has been successfully created according to the section 3.1 specifications with all 8 stages, correct manager assignments, and proper sequential flow from dependency verification through final infrastructure validation.
