UNDERSTANDING: User wants a complete mining-infrastructure-setup pipeline JSON file created based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 8 stages progressing from dependency verification through pool setup to final infrastructure validation, with specific stage transitions and manager assignments.

APPROACH: First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1 requirements and any existing pipeline structure patterns. Then examine any existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to follow the established format. Create a comprehensive JSON pipeline definition with all 8 stages, proper stage metadata, transitions, manager assignments, and validation criteria.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1 specifications
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/*.json to understand the expected format
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example pipeline files to learn the JSON schema (fields like stage_id, manager, validations, transitions, etc.)
4) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - 8 stages array with proper sequencing
   - Each stage containing: stage_id, name, manager, description, validations, error_handling, transitions
   - Proper manager assignments (config_generator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager, pool_server_manager, daemon_pool_connector, miner_manager, network_monitor)
   - Transition conditions matching the flow: verify_dependencies → generate_configs → start_daemon → fund_wallet → start_pool → verify_pool_daemon → configure_miner → infrastructure_ready
5) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/mining-infrastructure-setup.json with the complete pipeline definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Ensure all 8 stages are properly sequenced with correct transitions
- Validate that manager assignments match the specified mapping (verify_dependencies uses config_generator, generate_configs uses bitcoin_daemon_manager, etc.)
- Verify stage_id naming convention matches other pipelines
- Include proper validation criteria for each stage (e.g., dependency checks, config file existence, daemon status, wallet balance, RPC connectivity)
- Add error handling strategies for common failures (missing dependencies, daemon startup failures, connection timeouts)
- Ensure the pipeline follows the same JSON schema as existing templates
- Include END state transition from infrastructure_ready stage

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1
- Will display example pipeline JSON structure from existing templates
- Will provide the complete generated mining-infrastructure-setup.json file
- Will verify all 8 stages are present with correct manager assignments and transitions
- Will confirm file is written to the correct path

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a structured task with clear specifications. The stage flow and manager assignments are explicitly provided. Success depends on understanding the existing JSON schema format and accurately translating the 8-stage specification into proper JSON structure.
