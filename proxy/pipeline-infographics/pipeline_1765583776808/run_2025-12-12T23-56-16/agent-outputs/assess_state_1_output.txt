Now I have a clear picture. Let me provide my assessment.

## Current State

- **Client exists:** NO - There is no game client (no index.html, game.js, Phaser, or any frontend code). The `client/` folder does not exist.

- **Design docs:** Excellent documentation exists in `design-docs/`:
  - `combat-design.md` - Full Guild Wars 1-style combat system with 12 classes across 3 factions
  - `player-experience.md` - Complete player journey maps and UX design
  - `progression-design.md` - Leveling and progression systems
  - `balance-analysis.md` - DPS targets and balance tuning
  - `api-specification.md` - Backend API specs
  - `data-model.md` - Database schemas
  - Plus: `engagement-analysis.md`, `systems-integration.md`, `emergence-analysis.md`, `balance-audit.md`

- **Backend code:** Comprehensive TypeScript/Express backend in `src/`:
  - Auth system (JWT + refresh tokens)
  - Character service with full CRUD
  - Combat service + WebSocket handlers
  - Economy, social, guild systems
  - World service
  - Database layer with PostgreSQL repositories
  - Tests for all major systems

- **Can run:** YES - The backend can run via `npm run dev`. Package.json has all scripts configured.

## Recommendation

The project has a **complete backend server** and **detailed game design documents** but **NO game client whatsoever**. We need to build the entire frontend from scratch - a Phaser-based game client that implements the Guild Wars 1 style gameplay with Warhammer 40K aesthetics.

The design docs are incredibly thorough - they specify:
- 8-skill hotbar combat
- 12 classes (4 per faction: Imperial, Tau, Ork)
- Tab-targeting system
- Skill trees and progression
- Complete UI/UX flows

We have everything we need to build the client - we just need to actually build it.
