## 🎯 Automated Bug Reproduction Script Complete

I've created a comprehensive automated reproduction script for the critical ship control bug. Here's what was delivered:

### 📂 Files Created

1. **Main Reproduction Script** (`tests/reproduce_ship_control_bug.js`)
   - 700+ lines of fully automated Node.js test code
   - Uses WebSocket API to control the game
   - Executes exact 12-step reproduction sequence
   - Captures state snapshots at each step
   - Analyzes results for bug indicators
   - Generates detailed evidence files

2. **Documentation**
   - `tests/README.md` - Complete guide to test system
   - `tests/QUICK_START.md` - Fast reference for running tests
   - `tests/TEST_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step verification checklist
   - `tests/REPRODUCTION_SCRIPT_SUMMARY.json` - Structured metadata about the test

3. **Configuration**
   - `tests/package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts

### 🔄 How It Works

The script automates the exact bug reproduction sequence:

1. **Launch game** with test mode enabled (`?testMode=true`)
2. **Connect** to WebSocket server (port 8765)
3. **Execute 12 commands** via WebSocket API:
   - Get initial ship state → Teleport near station → Dock
   - Add afterburner (simulates crafting) → Fit to ship
   - **Undock** (bug trigger point)
   - Set throttle to 50% → Check if ship moves
   - Test navigation → Capture final state
4. **Analyze results** for bug indicators
5. **Generate evidence** files with complete diagnostic data

### 🐛 Bug Detection

The script detects the bug by checking:
- **Primary indicator**: Throttle set to 50% but ship speed = 0 m/s
- **Secondary indicators**: Velocity vector stuck at (0,0,0), no response to inputs

### 📊 Output

**If bug is reproduced:**
```
🔴 BUG REPRODUCTION: SUCCESS
Bug Indicators Detected:
  1. Throttle unresponsive - ship not accelerating
```
Exit code: 1

**If bug is fixed:**
```
🟢 BUG REPRODUCTION: FAILED
The bug was NOT reproduced in this test run.
```
Exit code: 0

### 💾 Evidence Files

All saved to `tests/evidence/`:
- `reproduction_evidence.json` - Complete test report with bug analysis
- `command_*.json` - Individual command results for each step

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests
npm install
node reproduce_ship_control_bug.js
```

### ✅ Key Features

- **Fully automated** - no manual intervention needed
- **Objective verification** - detects bug programmatically
- **Comprehensive evidence** - saves all state snapshots
- **Before/after testing** - run before fix, then after to verify
- **Detailed logging** - shows exactly what happened at each step
- **Error handling** - graceful failures with diagnostic info

### 📋 Next Steps for Bug Fix

1. Run script to confirm bug exists
2. Review evidence files to understand failure mode
3. Investigate identified files (ShipFittingManager.js, StationManager.js, etc.)
4. Implement fix
5. Re-run script to verify fix works
