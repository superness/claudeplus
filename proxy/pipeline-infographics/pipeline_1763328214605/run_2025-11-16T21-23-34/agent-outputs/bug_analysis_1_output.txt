  "bugSummary": "Ship controls become completely unresponsive after fitting items for the first time and undocking from a station",
  "expectedBehavior": "After fitting an item to the ship at a station and undocking, the player should be able to control the ship normally: change navigation direction via double-click, increase/decrease speed with throttle, click objects to target/navigate, and receive direction change notifications",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship becomes completely uncontrollable after undocking. Navigation direction cannot be changed, speed cannot be increased (throttle shows set but no movement), clicking objects doesn't trigger navigation/targeting, and double-clicking in space produces no direction change notification. Ship appears frozen/unresponsive despite UI showing normal state",
  "affectedSystems": ["navigation", "ship_controls", "ship_fitting", "station_docking", "input_handling", "ship_initialization"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Start game with a ship that has no fitted items/modules",
    "Step 2: Navigate to and dock at a station",
    "Step 3: Open crafting/building interface at the station",
    "Step 4: Build a module (e.g., Afterburner I or similar)",
    "Step 5: Add the built module to ship inventory",
    "Step 6: Open ship fitting interface",
    "Step 7: Fit the newly built module to the ship",
    "Step 8: Save the fitting configuration",
    "Step 9: Undock from the station",
    "Step 10: Attempt to control ship: try double-clicking space, clicking objects, adjusting throttle",
    "Step 11: Observe that ship is completely unresponsive to all control inputs"

  "hypothesis": "The ship fitting process or undocking sequence is likely breaking the connection between input handlers and the ship's control systems. Possible causes: (1) ShipFittingManager may be reinitializing the ship object in a way that disconnects event listeners or navigation state, (2) The undocking process may not properly restore ship control state after fitting changes, (3) Ship.js initialization may be missing a crucial step when fitted items are present for the first time, (4) InputManager event bindings may be getting cleared during the fitting/undocking process, or (5) NavigationManager state may not be properly synchronized with the ship's new fitted configuration. The fact that this only occurs on FIRST-TIME fitting suggests a state initialization issue rather than a recurring bug in the fitting system itself."
