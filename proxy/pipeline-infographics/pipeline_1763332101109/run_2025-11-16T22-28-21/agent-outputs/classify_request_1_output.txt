  "reasoning": "The user explicitly states 'The player ship is not moving at all' which indicates broken functionality. The request uses clear bug indicators like 'not moving', 'Debug and fix', and 'finding and fixing the bug'. The user has already attempted to use the feature (setting navigation targets, tapping) but it's not working as expected. This is a classic bug fix scenario where existing functionality has failed.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The player ship is not moving at all even after setting navigation targets and tapping places to fly to in space. Debug and fix the ship movement system by: 1) Identifying where navigation targets are set when the user taps, 2) Checking if the movement/physics code is properly reading and responding to these targets, 3) Verifying the ship's velocity/position is being updated each frame, 4) Finding and fixing the bug preventing movement, and 5) Testing the fix to ensure the ship now moves to tapped locations.",
