ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Crystal Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive understanding of the requirement - creating a miner_manager agent JSON that manages CPU mining software lifecycle (installation, configuration, wallet setup, monitoring, lifecycle control)

2. **Logical Step-by-Step Approach**: The 10-step breakdown is methodical:
   - Analyzes source requirements (section 2.1)
   - Studies existing agent patterns for schema compliance
   - Designs structure following established conventions
   - Maps capabilities to endpoints systematically
   - Defines comprehensive error handling
   - Validates against requirements before writing

3. **Concrete Technical Details**: 
   - Specific schema fields defined (miner_executable, pool_config, monitoring intervals)
   - Specific RPC endpoints mapped (/install, /configure, /start, /stop, /status, etc.)
   - Specific error scenarios with recovery actions
   - All 4 required decisions explicitly listed
   - All 5 permissions properly mapped to usage

4. **Pattern Adherence**: Shows understanding of existing codebase by referencing wallet_manager.json, bitcoin_daemon_manager.json, pool_server_manager.json for schema patterns

5. **Integration Awareness**: Properly identifies dependencies (pool_server_manager, wallet_manager, bitcoin_daemon_manager)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence Collection - CRITICAL GAP**: While the plan describes WHAT evidence will be provided (8 items listed), it does NOT specify HOW to collect concrete verification evidence. The evidence section lists outputs but not validation methods:
   - Missing: "Read the written file to verify JSON is valid"
   - Missing: "Use Bash with `jq` or `python -m json.tool` to validate JSON syntax"
   - Missing: "Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 again to cross-check all requirements are covered"
   - Missing: "Compare final JSON structure against wallet_manager.json to verify schema consistency"

2. **Verification Steps**: The plan jumps from "write file" to "validate mentally" - mental validation is not concrete proof

3. **Reference Document Reading**: Plan says "analyze section 2.1 lines 116-186" but doesn't include explicit step to READ the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file first to verify those line numbers and extract requirements

**Critical Missing Steps for Evidence:**
- Step to READ `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` and extract section 2.1 requirements
- Step to READ existing agent JSON files to extract schema pattern
- Step to READ the written file after creation to verify it was written correctly
- Step to validate JSON syntax programmatically (not mentally)

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence lists what will be demonstrated (schema compliance, requirements mapping, etc.) but lacks CONCRETE VERIFICATION METHODS. Evidence should include:
- File read operations showing the actual written JSON content
- Programmatic JSON validation output (syntax check)
- Side-by-side comparison outputs (requirements vs. implementation)
- Explicit confirmation that all 7 requirements are mapped to specific JSON fields

The plan relies on "validate JSON structure mentally" which provides zero verifiable proof.

DECISION REASONING:

While the technical approach is sound and demonstrates strong understanding, the plan has a critical flaw in evidence collection. The absence of concrete verification steps (reading written files, programmatic validation, cross-checking against source documents) means we cannot be confident the implementation will provide solid proof of correctness.

A plan this complex MUST include explicit verification steps:
1. Read source requirements document
2. Read existing agent patterns
3. Write the new agent
4. **Read back the written agent to verify content**
5. **Validate JSON syntax with tooling**
6. **Cross-check against requirements document**

Steps 4-6 are missing or insufficient ("mental validation").

**DECISION: REJECTED**

**Specific Revision Needed:**
Add explicit verification steps:
- Step 0: "Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1 to extract exact requirements"
- Step 2: "Read wallet_manager.json and other agents to extract schema template"
- Step 11: "Read the written /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/miner_manager.json file to verify content"
- Step 12: "Validate JSON syntax using Bash tool with python -m json.tool"
- Step 13: "Cross-reference final JSON against section 2.1 requirements list"

DECISION: REJECTED
