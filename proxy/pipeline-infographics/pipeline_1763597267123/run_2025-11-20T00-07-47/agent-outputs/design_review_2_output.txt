ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates strong comprehension of the task - building a miner_manager agent JSON file based on section 2.1 of the automation plan document.

2. **Logical Structure**: The 12-step approach is well-organized, starting with research (reading existing agents), moving to design (creating the JSON structure), and ending with verification.

3. **Pattern-Based Design**: Leveraging existing agent patterns (bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager, pool_server_manager) is a sound approach that ensures consistency with the codebase.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The plan addresses all specified requirements:
   - Mining software configuration/installation
   - Wallet creation/import
   - Pool connection management
   - Hashrate monitoring
   - Graceful shutdown
   - All four decision outcomes
   - Proper permissions mapping

5. **Thorough Test Considerations**: Excellent enumeration of edge cases and failure scenarios (missing wallet, connection failures, various miner types, orphaned processes, etc.).

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence Specificity**: While the evidence section lists deliverables, it doesn't specify HOW completion will be verified. For example:
   - How will you prove the JSON is valid and follows the schema?
   - What constitutes "complete" mapping of section 2.1 requirements?
   - How will you verify the agent would actually work if instantiated?

2. **Missing Concrete Verification Steps**: The plan should include:
   - JSON schema validation against existing patterns
   - Line-by-line comparison showing section 2.1 requirement → JSON implementation
   - Specific files/sections that will be referenced in the mapping document

3. **Vague on "Helper Script References"**: The plan mentions miner-control.sh and wallet-setup.sh but doesn't clarify:
   - Are these existing scripts to reference?
   - Or new scripts to be created?
   - Or just placeholder references in the JSON?

4. **Step 1 Ambiguity**: "Read the existing miner_manager.json from build/bin/Debug/config/agents/" - but what if this doesn't exist yet? The plan should handle both scenarios explicitly.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence lacks CONCRETE VERIFICATION CRITERIA:

**Missing:**
- Specific validation commands (e.g., "JSON validates against schema X")
- Exact file references for the mapping document
- Quantifiable completeness metrics (e.g., "All 7 requirements from section 2.1 lines 165-186 mapped to specific JSON fields")
- Verification that the four decision outcomes are properly defined with correct syntax
- Confirmation that the JSON can be parsed and loaded by the agent framework

**What would make it Strong:**
- JSON schema validation output
- Checklist showing each section 2.1 requirement with corresponding JSON path
- Diff comparison showing this agent follows same structure as existing agents
- Test proving the JSON is syntactically valid
- Verification that all RPC endpoints follow the established naming convention

REASONING FOR DECISION:

**Positive Factors:**
- High confidence with valid justification
- Comprehensive understanding of requirements
- Well-structured approach
- Thorough consideration of edge cases

**Critical Gaps:**
- Evidence collection is too vague
- No clear verification criteria for "done"
- Cannot definitively prove the agent JSON will be correct and complete
- Missing concrete validation steps

The plan shows strong design thinking but lacks the VERIFIABLE PROOF mechanisms required for approval. While the implementer would likely produce a good result, the plan doesn't specify how we'd KNOW it's correct without manual inspection.

**DECISION: REJECTED**

The plan needs revision to include:
1. Specific validation steps (JSON schema validation, syntax checking)
2. Concrete mapping document format showing requirement → implementation traceability
3. Quantifiable completion criteria for each evidence item
4. Clear verification commands/tests that will prove correctness

DECISION: REJECTED
