ASSESSMENT:

This is a highly detailed and well-structured plan. Let me evaluate it critically:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear understanding**: The planner correctly identifies the task - creating a miner_manager agent JSON specification based on section 2.1, distinct from the existing pool-side miner connection manager
2. **Comprehensive requirements mapping**: Explicitly maps all requirements from lines 165-186 to agent capabilities
3. **Pattern-based approach**: Leverages existing agent JSON schemas (bitcoin_daemon_manager.json, pool_server_manager.json) to ensure consistency
4. **Detailed structure**: Specifies all JSON sections including metadata, configuration, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, RPC endpoints, dependencies, error handling, logging, and metrics
5. **Concrete outputs**: All required decision outputs explicitly listed (miner_started, miner_stopped, miner_error, error)
6. **Test scenarios**: Identifies 10 specific test scenarios the specification should handle
7. **Dependencies**: Properly identifies dependencies on pool_server_manager and wallet_manager

**Potential weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence could be more specific**: While the plan lists what will be provided, it doesn't specify HOW to verify the JSON is correct (e.g., JSON validation, schema compliance checks)
2. **Missing verification step**: No step to validate the written JSON file is syntactically correct and matches the expected schema
3. **Assumption about schema**: Assumes the schema pattern from existing agents is sufficient without explicitly validating against a formal schema document
4. **No rollback plan**: Doesn't address what happens if the file already exists at that path

**Evidence quality analysis:**
The proposed evidence includes:
- ✅ Complete JSON file with all sections
- ✅ Proper formatting matching existing patterns
- ✅ All capabilities from section 2.1 mapped
- ✅ All required decisions present
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ RPC endpoints defined
- ✅ Dependencies declared
- ✅ Metrics and logging configured
- ✅ Exact file path specified

However, missing:
- ❌ JSON syntax validation proof
- ❌ Schema compliance verification
- ❌ Comparison against section 2.1 to prove all requirements covered

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The evidence is concrete and verifiable. The output file path is specific, the required decision outputs are explicitly named, and the structure follows established patterns. While JSON validation isn't explicitly mentioned, the file itself will be inspectable and the structure can be verified against the source documentation.

**Overall assessment:**
This plan demonstrates strong understanding, logical sequencing, and concrete deliverables. The main gap is lack of explicit validation/verification step, but the evidence is still strong enough to verify completion. The plan is actionable and likely to succeed.
