## Summary

I've created the **Combat Design Document** for Celestial Grid, transforming simple tic-tac-toe into strategic cosmic warfare:

**Core Combat System**: Turn-based positional combat where each piece placement is an "attack" with a 5-phase turn structure (~1.5 seconds of visual spectacle per move). A Strategic Power formula calculates visual intensity and rewards based on cell value, threat lines, combos, and win streaks.

**Move Classifications**: Seven move types (Opening Strike, Aggressive Advance, Defensive Parry, Fork Attack, Counter-Fork, Forced Move, Finisher) with varying visual intensities and reward modifiers from 1.0x to 1.5x.

**Faction Combat Styles**: Luminara (O) uses "The Encircling Light" with golden radiant effects, while Voidborn (X) uses "The Reality Render" with void-ripping visuals. Both have mirrored abilities for balance.

**AI Bestiary**: Four opponents - The Initiate (easy, 40% mistake rate), The Adept (medium, strategic), The Eternal (hard, minimax), and The Primordial (impossible, perfect play - only ties achievable).

**Reward System**: Integrated with the resource economy - victories grant 100 currency + materials, with bonuses for Perfect Victory (+50%), Quick Victory (+25%), Fork Victory (+20%), and Epic Comeback (+30%). Loss rewards increased to 60-75 currency per market simulator recommendations.

**Difficulty Curve**: 20-game new player journey from Tutorial Realm through Proving Arena, plus per-match intensity scaling from calm openings to maximum-intensity endgames.

**Combat Variety**: Five match modes (Classic, Blitz, Marathon, Mirror, Chaos) supporting aggressive, defensive, and balanced playstyles with appropriate visual rewards for each.
