## Summary

I've completed the balance analysis for Celestial Grid's combat system. Here are my key findings:

**Verdict: BALANCED**

The combat system is mathematically sound and well-designed. Key strengths:

- **Strategic Power Formula** correctly weights cell positions (center 2.3x more valuable than edges, matching tic-tac-toe theory)
- **Reward rates** align with economy design: 1,125-1,900 currency/hour for balanced play
- **Faction parity** is perfect - Luminara and Voidborn have identical mechanics
- **AI difficulty curve** is smooth: 85% win rate in tutorials scaling down appropriately
- **Anti-exploit systems** are comprehensive (daily caps, win-trading detection, AFK prevention)

**Minor Issues Found:**
1. Loss rewards need sync: Combat doc says 40 currency, economy doc says 60-75. Recommend updating combat doc.
2. Grid Heart Shard drop from "Perfect Victory vs Primordial" is impossible (kept as intentional easter egg)

**No Exploits Found:** All potential abuse vectors have adequate mitigations.

DECISION: approved
