## Summary

I've created the geography design document for **Celestial Grid - The Eternal Game**, establishing the spatial and environmental framework for a visually spectacular Tic Tac Toe experience.

**Key Design Decisions:**

**Three Cosmic Planes**: The arena exists at the intersection of the Luminous Expanse (Luminara's golden realm), the Abyssal Depths (Voidborn's purple-black void), and the Convergence Zone (neutral ground). The background dynamically shifts based on who controls more territory.

**The Nine Quadrants**: Each grid cell has unique geographic identity:
- Four **Anchors** (corners) - named Dawn, Zenith, Shadow, and Midnight
- Four **Gates** (edges) - representing transitions between anchors  
- One **Nexus** (center) - the ultimate point of power

**Dynamic Weather System**: Environmental conditions respond to game state - Radiant Storms when Luminara dominates, Void Storms when Voidborn leads, and beautiful Convergence Auroras during balanced play or draws.

**Celestial Landmarks**: Background features include the Eternal Sun, Crystal Moons, Dark Star, Void Rift, and the mysterious Arbiter's Eye - providing visual depth and narrative grounding.

**Scaled Visual Intensity**: The environment starts calm and escalates through opening, mid-game, and endgame phases, with maximum spectacle during victory moments.

The geography transforms a simple 9-cell grid into a galaxy-spanning battlefield while ensuring the core gameplay remains clear and readable.
