## Summary

The economy simulation is complete. Here are the key findings:

**Verdict: APPROVED** - The economy is fundamentally sound with no critical exploits.

**Key Findings:**

1. **No Infinite Money Loops**: Currency conversion penalties (33% loss) effectively block arbitrage. No resale mechanism exists, making buy-low-sell-high impossible.

2. **First Purchase Timing**: Slightly slower than the 30-45 minute target (actual: ~60-90 minutes for 40% win rate players). Recommend reducing Common skin price from 400 to 350.

3. **Win/Loss Ratio**: The 4:1 reward ratio is aggressive - lower-skill players may feel economically punished. Recommend increasing loss rewards from 40-50 to 60-75 currency.

4. **Endgame Stability**: Simulation shows 200+ hour players accumulate ~150,000 currency with 40-60 items owned. The system sustains engagement through content rotation and Flash Sales.

5. **No Dead-End Resources**: All currencies and materials have clear expenditure paths.

**Minor Tuning Recommended:**
- Lower Common skin price to 350
- Increase loss match rewards to 60-75
- Add 25 Stardust to daily login
- Cap Shadow Market price spikes at 1.35x (currently 1.50x)

DECISION: approved
