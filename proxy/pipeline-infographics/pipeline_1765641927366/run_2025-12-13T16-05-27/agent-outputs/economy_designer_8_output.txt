## Summary

I've created the **Economy Design Document** for Celestial Grid - The Eternal Game, establishing a cosmic marketplace that reflects the philosophical differences between the Luminara and Voidborn factions.

**Market Structure**: Three distinct markets operate in parallel:
- **Radiant Bazaar** (Luminara): Fixed prices with bulk discounts (5-15%), reflecting their philosophy of fair collective prosperity
- **Shadow Market** (Voidborn): Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand with flash sales, embracing opportunistic trading
- **Arbiter's Nexus** (Neutral): Regulated premium goods and currency exchange services

**Pricing System**: Items range from Common (300-500 currency, 30-45 min acquisition) to Legendary (12,000-20,000 currency, 60-120 hours). Cross-faction shopping incurs a 15% markup, adding strategic depth to faction loyalty.

**Currency Exchange**: The Exchange Master converts currencies at 3:2 rates (33% loss), with daily limits preventing arbitrage. Material conversion follows 5:1 upward crafting within factions, 3:2 cross-faction with similar penalties.

**Economic Flow**: 70% of income comes from matches, flowing into cosmetics (60% of spending), crafting (20%), and boost items (8%). Conversion losses and failed experimental crafts provide additional sinks.

**Player Progression**: Economy unlocks gradually - Common items for new players, Uncommon at 10 hours, Rare at 50 hours, and Legendary access at 200+ hours. No direct player trading prevents RMT abuse.

**Inflation Prevention**: Currency maintains value through new content releases rather than decay, with hard caps on daily earnings (8,000 faction currency, 500 Stardust, 3 Nexus Shards/week).
