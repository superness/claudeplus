## Summary

I've created a comprehensive resource design document for **Celestial Grid - The Eternal Game** that integrates seamlessly with the established lore, geography, and cultures.

**Four Primary Currencies** are faction-aligned:
- **Lumens** (Luminara/golden) and **Essence** (Voidborn/purple) earned through faction victories
- **Stardust** (neutral/silver) earned from draws and achievements
- **Nexus Shards** (Arbiter/prismatic) for premium content via events and challenges

**Five-Tier Material System** (Common to Legendary) with faction variants:
- Luminara line: Spark Fragments → Dawn Crystals → Herald's Light → Archon Essence → Primordial Light
- Voidborn line: Shadow Wisps → Void Crystals → Eclipser's Darkness → Nullifier Essence → Primordial Void
- Neutral line: Grid Dust → Balance Stones → Arbiter's Seal → Convergence Core → Grid Heart

**Acquisition Methods** include match rewards (with streak bonuses and special conditions like Perfect Victory), daily login cycles, achievements, and weekly/monthly challenges. Drop rates scale appropriately from 100% for Tier 1 to 0.01-0.05% for Tier 5.

**Crafting System** uses 5:1 upward conversion within factions and cross-faction conversion at a 33% loss penalty. Recipes unlock cosmetics, effects, themes, and temporary boosts.

**Economy Balance** targets 600-800 currency per hour, first unlock at 30-60 minutes, and legendary items requiring 50-100 hours. Multiple sinks (cosmetics, crafting, conversion losses) prevent inflation.

The system ensures resources flow naturally between match play, progression unlocks, and the cosmetic shop while maintaining thematic ties to the cosmic Luminara/Voidborn conflict.
