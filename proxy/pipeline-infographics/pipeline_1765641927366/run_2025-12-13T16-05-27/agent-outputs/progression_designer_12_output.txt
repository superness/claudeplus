## Summary

I've created a comprehensive progression design document for **Celestial Grid - The Eternal Game** at `output/design-docs/progression-design.md`.

**Leveling System**: An exponential XP curve (level cap 50) with ~3 matches to level early, scaling to ~195 matches between levels 49-50. Time to cap: 95-120 hours.

**Prestige System (Cycles of Eternity)**: After reaching level 50, players can "Cycle" to reset their level while gaining permanent XP bonuses (+2% to +15%) and exclusive cosmetics, extending engagement indefinitely.

**Dual Faction Ranks**: Seven tiers per faction (Spark→Primordial Light for Luminara; Flicker→Primordial Void for Voidborn) based on faction-specific wins, unlocking crafting tiers and currency bonuses.

**Arbiter Rank**: Neutral progression rewarding balanced play and draws, enabling cross-faction features.

**Three Skill Trees**: 
- Luminous Path (Luminara visual enhancements)
- Void Path (Voidborn visual enhancements)  
- Convergent Path (balance/neutral bonuses)

Each has 10-14 skills across 4 tiers with meaningful visual unlocks.

**Unlock Timeline**: First cosmetic at 30-45 minutes, Uncommon access at 10-20 hours, Rare at 35-45 hours, Epic at 60-80 hours, Legendary at 95-120 hours.

**Key Milestones**: 10 level milestones with escalating rewards (Stardust, Nexus Shards, unlock tokens), plus faction rank rewards and 30+ achievements.

**Endgame Systems**: Mastery tracking, collection completion bonuses (up to +15% currency), seasonal ladders with exclusive rewards, and legacy achievements for 1000+ hour players.

The system integrates seamlessly with the combat XP sources (50/30/20 for win/draw/loss with bonuses) and economy pricing (faction rank discounts on crafting costs).
