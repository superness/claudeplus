Looking at this user request, I need to analyze what type of development work is needed.

**Analysis:**

The user is reporting that a specific game system (Active Mission tutorial) is not working correctly. Specifically:
- The mission objective "craft and equip an item to your ship" is not completing
- The player performs the required actions (crafts afterburner + equips it)
- The system fails to detect/register completion
- This is distinct from a previous achievement/quest fix

**Key Indicators:**
- "bug with the Active Mission tutorial system"
- "not completing even when the player crafts..."
- "is not being marked as complete"
- The functionality EXISTS but is BROKEN (not working as designed)
- Requires investigation of existing code logic
- Needs fix to detection/completion logic

**Classification Decision:**

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** because:
1. Feature exists (Active Mission system)
2. Expected behavior is defined (should complete when craft + equip)
3. Actual behavior is broken (not completing)
4. No new functionality requested, just fix existing broken logic
5. Keywords: "bug", "not completing", "not being marked as complete"
