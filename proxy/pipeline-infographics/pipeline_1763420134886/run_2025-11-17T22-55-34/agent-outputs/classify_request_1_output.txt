  "reasoning": "The user explicitly states that a visual element (progress-filling circle in the center of the radial HUD) is 'missing' and 'not displaying'. This is a clear case of broken functionality - something that should be working is not appearing. The request uses key bug indicators: 'missing', 'not displaying', 'not appearing', and asks to 'identify why it's not appearing' and 'fix it'. The hover delay works correctly, but the center visualization component is broken.",

    "originalRequest": "The user reports that the radial HUD correctly waits for hover to open, which is working well. However, the center visualization is missing - specifically, there should be a progress-filling circle in the center of the radial HUD that is currently not displaying. Please investigate the radial HUD code, locate where the center progress circle visualization should be rendered, identify why it's not appearing, and fix it so the progress-filling circle displays correctly in the center of the radial HUD.",
