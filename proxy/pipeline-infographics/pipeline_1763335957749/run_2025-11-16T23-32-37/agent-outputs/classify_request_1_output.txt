    "debuggingSteps": [
      "Check navigation target setting on tap",

    ]
  }
}
```

This is clearly a bug fix request because:
1. Core functionality (ship movement) is completely broken
2. User explicitly calls it a "critical gameplay bug"
3. Request focuses on investigating, identifying root cause, and fixing
4. Expected behavior is clear: ship should move when player taps locations
5. No new features requested - just restoring existing functionality

DECISION: BUG_FIX
