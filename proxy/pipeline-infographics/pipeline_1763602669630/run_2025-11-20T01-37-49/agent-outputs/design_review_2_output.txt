**ASSESSMENT:**

This plan demonstrates strong understanding of the requirements and provides a comprehensive design approach for the performance_analyzer agent. Let me evaluate the key aspects:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Requirements Extraction**: The plan correctly identifies section 2.3 (lines 356-376) as the source and lists all required capabilities (hashrate, share acceptance, block timing, bottlenecks, reporting)
2. **Logical Methodology**: The 8-step approach is well-structured: extract requirements → study references → define metrics → design decision tree → structure prompt → validate → create JSON → document tool usage
3. **Concrete Metrics Defined**: Specific performance indicators are listed (hashrate %, acceptance rate %, block discovery time, latency, RPC response time)
4. **Decision Tree with Thresholds**: Numeric criteria provided (e.g., hashrate ≥90% = good, 50-90% = issues, <50% = critical)
5. **Reference Analysis**: Plan leverages existing agents (mining_status_checker, system_analyzer) to ensure consistent structure
6. **Tool Usage Clarity**: Each permitted tool (Bash, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Glob) has defined usage patterns
7. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test scenarios identified (optimal, degraded, multiple bottlenecks, missing data, edge cases)

**Verification of Requirements Coverage:**
- ✅ Analyze mining performance and efficiency
- ✅ Calculate effective hashrate (with formula and comparison)
- ✅ Measure share acceptance rate (percentage calculation)
- ✅ Track block discovery time (actual vs theoretical)
- ✅ Identify bottlenecks (CPU, network, RPC, stratum)
- ✅ Generate performance reports (template structure defined)
- ✅ Compare to expected values (baseline comparison methodology)
- ✅ 4 decisions mapped (analysis_complete, performance_good, performance_issues, error)

**Areas of Concern:**
1. **Missing Implementation Details**: While the plan describes WHAT to include in the system prompt, it doesn't provide the ACTUAL text of the prompt sections - this is acceptable for a design phase
2. **Threshold Justification**: The numeric thresholds (90%, 95%, etc.) are stated but not justified with mining industry standards - could be stronger
3. **Bottleneck Detection**: Methodology is mentioned but specific diagnostic commands/patterns are not detailed in the plan

**Evidence Specification:**
The plan promises to deliver:
- ✅ Complete JSON structure specification
- ✅ Detailed system prompt with 8+ sections
- ✅ Decision tree with numeric thresholds
- ✅ Metrics collection methodology
- ✅ Performance report template
- ✅ Tool usage examples for each tool
- ✅ Validation criteria array (7+ items)
- ✅ Expertise array (6+ domains)
- ✅ Requirements verification checklist

These are **concrete, verifiable deliverables** that can be inspected in the final JSON.

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY:** Strong

The proposed evidence is specific and verifiable:
- JSON file structure can be validated against schema
- System prompt sections can be counted and reviewed for completeness
- Decision thresholds can be checked for numeric specificity
- Tool usage patterns can be tested for executability
- Report template can be evaluated for coverage of required sections
- The final output at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/performance_analyzer.json` will serve as tangible proof

The plan includes validation through test scenarios (optimal, degraded, error cases) which demonstrates thoughtfulness about real-world usage.

**Minor Gaps:**
- Could specify exact log file paths to search (e.g., `/var/log/mining/*.log`)
- Could define expected value sources more precisely (config file locations)
- Could specify report output location

However, these are implementation details that can be addressed during development, not critical gaps in the design plan.

**Confidence Justification Review:**
The "High Confidence" claim is **well-justified**:
- Clear source document (section 2.3)
- Multiple reference agents available
- Standard mining metrics (well-understood domain)
- Design task (not implementation)
- Quantifiable decision criteria
- Comprehensive test scenario coverage

---

**DECISION:** APPROVED

**Reasoning:** This design plan demonstrates thorough understanding of requirements, provides a logical step-by-step approach with specific deliverables, and specifies concrete evidence (JSON structure, prompt sections, decision thresholds, tool patterns) that can be verified. The plan addresses all 7 stated requirements and maps them to the 4 required decisions with quantifiable thresholds. While some implementation details could be more granular, the design-level specification is sufficiently detailed to guide implementation and validate completion. The high confidence rating is appropriately justified.

DECISION: APPROVED
