  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'is not properly resetting' and describes broken functionality - the debug menu reset function fails to clear certain game state. They provide specific symptoms (tutorial popups not resetting, first mission cannot be replayed, ship fitting persisting) and request investigation and fixing of the reset implementation. The keywords 'not properly', 'should be cleared', 'fix the reset function' and the detailed description of broken behavior are strong indicators of a bug fix.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The debug menu reset function is not properly resetting the game state. Specifically: 1. Tutorial popups like 'choose awakening' are not being reset and won't show again 2. The first mission cannot be reopened or replayed after reset 3. Ship fitting/loadout is persisting across resets when it should be cleared",
