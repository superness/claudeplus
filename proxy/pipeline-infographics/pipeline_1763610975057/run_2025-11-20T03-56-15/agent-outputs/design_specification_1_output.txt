UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a comprehensive end-to-end mining cycle test pipeline based on section 3.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should include 10 stages (setup_infrastructure through cycle_complete) with specific agent assignments, and the output should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/full-mining-cycle.json

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.2 specifications
2. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON structure
3. Map each of the 10 stages to their assigned agents with appropriate configurations
4. Define dependencies between stages (sequential flow from setup through cycle_complete)
5. Add proper error handling, timeout configurations, and validation criteria for each stage
6. Write the complete pipeline JSON following the established template format

STEPS:
1. Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to get section 3.2 specifications using `Read` tool
2. Search for existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ using `Glob` tool with pattern "*.json"
3. Read 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the structure, schema, and conventions used
4. Identify the agent types referenced (multiple agents, config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager, cycle_integration_tester)
5. Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions for all 10 stages
   - Agent assignments for each stage
   - Stage dependencies (sequential: stage N depends on stage N-1)
   - Configuration parameters for each stage (timeouts, retry logic, validation criteria)
   - Input/output specifications for data flow between stages
6. Write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/full-mining-cycle.json using `Write` tool
7. Verify the JSON is valid and complete by reading it back

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will ensure the pipeline handles stage failures gracefully with proper error propagation
- Will verify that stage dependencies are correctly defined to prevent out-of-order execution
- Will validate that each stage has appropriate timeout values to prevent infinite hangs
- Will confirm that agent names match the available agent types in the system
- Will test that the JSON is properly formatted and parseable
- Will ensure data can flow between stages (output of stage N becomes input to stage N+1)
- Will verify the pipeline can handle the full cycle: infrastructure → mining → block discovery → maturation → wallet credit

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the content of section 3.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the requirements
- Will show the structure of existing pipeline JSON templates for comparison
- Will display the complete generated JSON file content
- Will show the file successfully written to the target location
- Will demonstrate that the JSON includes all 10 required stages with correct agent assignments
- Will verify the dependency chain flows correctly from setup_infrastructure to cycle_complete

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While the 10 stages and agent assignments are clearly specified, confidence is medium because:
1. Need to read section 3.2 to understand detailed specifications, validation criteria, and configuration requirements
2. Need to examine existing pipeline templates to ensure compatibility with the system's expected JSON schema
3. The exact parameters, timeouts, and configuration details for each stage are not specified in the user input and must be derived from the documentation
4. Unknown if there are specific validation rules or schema constraints for the pipeline JSON format
