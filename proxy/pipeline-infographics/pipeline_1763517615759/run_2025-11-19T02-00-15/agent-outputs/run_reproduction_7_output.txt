# Execution Results

## ✅ Environment Setup: COMPLETED

```json
{
  "httpServerRunning": true,
  "httpServerCachingDisabled": true,
  "oldChromeProcessesKilled": true,
  "workingDirectory": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships",
  "port8080Available": true

```

## ✅ Reproduction Script: FOUND AND EXECUTED

**Script:** `test_mission_tracker_regression.js`

**Execution:** Completed successfully (terminated early due to game disconnect)

## 📊 Evidence Analysis

### Test Results

| Test Phase | Status | Result |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Environment Setup | ✅ | Complete |
| Script Found | ✅ | `test_mission_tracker_regression.js` |
| Script Executed | ✅ | Yes |
| Mining Test | ⚠️ | **Tritanium NOT mined** |
| Mission Update | ❌ | **Not tested - mining failed** |

### Critical Findings

1. **Mining Failed**: The test mined for 10 seconds but collected **0 tritanium**
   - Inventory showed: `tritanium: 0, pyerite: 83`
   - Mining was started successfully: `"mining": true, "fieldId": "mineral_field_1"`
   - Ship was teleported within mining range (500m from target)

2. **Test Terminated Early**: Game disconnected before reaching anomaly/crafting tests
   - Status: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`
   - Reason: WebSocket connection lost

3. **Console Logs Captured**: 5 console errors (Chrome GCM auth errors, not game-related)

## 🔍 Key Observations

1. **Mining Mechanics Issue**: The core mining functionality appears broken - ship started mining but collected 0 tritanium in 10 seconds
2. **Mineral Field Mismatch**: Inventory has 83 pyerite but 0 tritanium - suggests mineral field may not contain tritanium
3. **Test Could Not Verify Mission Bug**: Because mining didn't collect tritanium, we couldn't verify if the mission tracker would update
4. **Game Stability**: WebSocket disconnected after 12 seconds of testing

## Next Steps Required

The test revealed a **deeper issue**: Mining itself is not working correctly. Before we can verify the mission tracker regression:

1. **Fix mining mechanics** - Why is mining collecting 0 tritanium?
2. **Verify mineral field contents** - Does `mineral_field_1` actually contain tritanium?
3. **Re-run reproduction** - Once mining works, re-test mission tracker updates

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The reproduction test executed successfully but revealed a **framework-level issue** (mining not collecting resources) that prevented verification of the mission tracker bug. The test infrastructure worked correctly, but the underlying game mechanics failed.
