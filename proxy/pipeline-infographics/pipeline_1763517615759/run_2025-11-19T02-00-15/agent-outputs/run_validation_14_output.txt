## Summary

The reproduction script executed successfully through the environment setup and initial test steps, but encountered a **test framework issue** that prevented bug validation:

### Test Execution Progress:
1. ✅ **Step 1-2**: Retrieved initial mission state and found mineral field
2. ✅ **Step 3-4**: Set navigation target and teleported near mineral field
3. ❌ **Step 5**: Mining failed - ship reported as "not within mining range" despite teleporting to calculated position (500m offset)

### Framework Error:
The test script calculated a teleport position 500m from the mineral field (which should be within mining range), but the game's `startMining` command rejected it as out of range. This is a test script issue, not evidence about the mission tracker bug itself.

### Evidence Collected:
- **Console logs**: Successfully captured (5 entries, all Chrome GCM errors - not game-related)
- **Initial mission state**: All 4 objectives showing as incomplete (⬜)
- **Commands executed**: 5 commands before framework error
- **Status**: Test aborted before mission tracker could be validated

### Recommendation:
The reproduction script needs adjustment to fix the mining range calculation issue. The script should either:
- Use a closer teleport distance (e.g., 100m instead of 500m)
- Check actual mining range from game configuration
- Wait for ship to approach target naturally instead of teleporting

The test did NOT validate whether the mission tracker regression exists because it couldn't complete the mining action.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
