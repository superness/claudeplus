Based on the evidence I've reviewed, I can now provide my validation analysis. The evidence files show that **the validation test was unable to complete successfully** due to framework errors. However, I can still analyze what the evidence reveals about the fix:

## Fix Validation Analysis

  },
  "additionalObservations": [
    "No game-specific console logs captured (only Chrome internal errors)",
    "No mission tracking setup messages in console output",
    "No hook installation confirmation logs",
    "Framework disconnection suggests possible timeout or crash during test",
    "The fix changes tracking methods from async to sync, but validation couldn't confirm effectiveness"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.35,
  "recommendation": "Re-run validation test with modifications:\n1. Find a mineral field that SPECIFICALLY contains tritanium (not mixed)\n2. Increase mining duration to ensure enough tritanium is collected\n3. Add console log filtering to capture mission tracking debug messages\n4. Add explicit check: Does the mineral field contain the target resource?\n5. Fix framework disconnection issue (possible timeout after 15-second wait)"
}
```

## Critical Finding

The validation test **CANNOT determine if the fix works** because:

1. **Wrong Resource Type**: The mission requires **tritanium** (1000 units), but the test mined **isogen** (45 units) from a "mixed" field
2. **Mission Tracker Logic**: The mission tracker likely only updates when the SPECIFIC resource type matching the objective is collected
3. **Framework Error**: Test encountered "FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED" preventing complete validation
4. **No Console Logs**: No mission tracking setup or hook installation messages captured

## Test Design Flaw

The validation test has a critical flaw:
- It targets `mineral_field_10` which is a **"mixed" field** (contains random resources)
- It doesn't verify the field contains **tritanium** before starting to mine
- After 15 seconds, only **isogen** was collected (45 units), not tritanium
- The mission tracker correctly did NOT update because isogen ≠ tritanium

## Validation Outcome

**DECISION: FIX_INCOMPLETE**

The fix implementation appears correct (synchronous hook wrapping matching the working crafting system), but validation failed because:
1. Test design flaw (mining wrong resource type)
2. Framework disconnection error
3. No console evidence of hook installation or mission tracking activity

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Fix the validation test to target a tritanium-specific field or verify field contents first
2. Investigate and resolve the framework disconnection error
3. Enable console log capture for game-specific debug messages
4. Re-run validation with corrected test
