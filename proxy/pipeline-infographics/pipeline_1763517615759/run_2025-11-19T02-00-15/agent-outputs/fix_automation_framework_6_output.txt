Perfect! The test script has been fixed to correctly handle the inventory API response format. The `getInventory()` command returns `resources` as an object with resource types as keys, not as an array.

## Summary

**Framework Error Fixed:**

The test script `test_mission_tracker_regression.js` had a bug in its response handler at line 133. It expected `r.resources` to be an array and tried to use the `.find()` method on it:

```javascript
// BROKEN:
const tritaniumQty = r.resources.find(res => res.type === 'tritanium')?.quantity || 0;
```

However, according to the game's `GameTestingInterface.js:476-521`, the `getInventory()` API returns resources as an **object** (key-value pairs):

```javascript
inventory.resources = {
  'tritanium': 1000,
  'pyerite': 500,
  // ... etc
}
```

**Fix Applied:**

Changed the test script to correctly access the resources object:

```javascript
// FIXED:
const tritaniumQty = r.resources['tritanium'] || 0;
```

This matches the actual API response format where resources are stored as an object with resource type IDs as keys and quantities as values.
