Excellent! All changes look good. Let me create a summary of the fixes:

## Framework Fix Summary

### Problem Identified
The reproduction test script `test_mission_tracker_regression.js` had incorrect teleport distance calculations that placed the ship beyond interaction range:

1. **Mining teleport offset**: 5000m (line 90) - **BEYOND mining range (~2500m)**
2. **Anomaly teleport offset**: 1000m (line 225) - **Potentially beyond exploration range**

This caused:
- Mining command to fail with "No mineral fields in range"
- Game to disconnect unexpectedly during test execution
- Test unable to reproduce the actual bug (mission tracker not updating)

### Fixes Applied

**1. Reduced mining teleport offset** (line 90):
   - **Before**: `x + 5000` (5000m offset)
   - **After**: `x + 500` (500m offset - well within ~2500m mining range)
   - Added descriptive console log: "Teleported near mineral field (500m offset - within mining range)"

**2. Reduced anomaly teleport offset** (line 225):
   - **Before**: `x + 1000` (1000m offset)
   - **After**: `x + 500` (500m offset - ensuring exploration trigger)
   - Added descriptive console log: "Teleported near anomaly (500m offset - within exploration range)"

**3. Added range documentation** (lines 38-40):
   - Documented EVE-style game mechanic ranges
   - Mining range: ~2500m
   - Anomaly exploration range: ~5000m
   - Explained teleport offset strategy (500m to stay well within range)

### Expected Test Behavior After Fix

With these corrections, the test should now:
1. ✅ Teleport within mining range (500m from mineral field)
2. ✅ Successfully start mining tritanium
3. ✅ Wait 10 seconds for resource collection
4. ✅ Verify tritanium was mined
5. ✅ Check if mission tracker mining objective updates (bug reproduction)
6. ✅ Teleport within anomaly exploration range (500m from anomaly)
7. ✅ Trigger anomaly exploration
8. ✅ Check if mission tracker exploration objective updates (bug reproduction)
9. ✅ Complete crafting/fitting test to verify that fix still works
10. ✅ Present comprehensive summary of which mission objectives updated correctly

The test will now properly reproduce the regression bug where mining and anomaly exploration mission objectives don't update, while the crafting objective does.
