Excellent! All three tracking methods now use the same synchronous pattern. Let me create a summary of the fix implementation:

```json
{
  "filesModified": [
    {
      "path": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/UniverseIntegrationManager.js",
      "changes": [
        {
          "lineNumber": "957-995",
          "oldCode": "trackMiningActions() with nested setupMiningTracking() function, retry logic using setTimeout, and asynchronous pattern with maxRetries=10",
          "newCode": "trackMiningActions() with direct synchronous wrapping of resourceManager.addResource, matching the pattern used in trackCraftingActions()",
          "reason": "Removed async retry logic that caused timing issues where hooks were installed too late or in wrong context. Now uses immediate synchronous wrapping that works consistently."
        },
        {
          "lineNumber": "997-1029",
          "oldCode": "trackExplorationActions() with nested setupExplorationTracking() function and setTimeout retry logic",
          "newCode": "trackExplorationActions() with direct synchronous wrapping of anomalyExplorer.onCompletion, matching the pattern used in trackCraftingActions()",
          "reason": "Removed async retry logic that caused timing issues. Now uses immediate synchronous wrapping for consistency with crafting tracking."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fixSummary": "Converted trackMiningActions() and trackExplorationActions() from asynchronous retry-based pattern to synchronous immediate-wrapping pattern, matching the working trackCraftingActions() implementation",
  "expectedImpact": "All three mission step types (mining, exploration, crafting/fitting) will now update correctly. When a player mines tritanium or explores an anomaly, the mission tracker will immediately detect the action and update progress. The regression is resolved while preserving the crafting/fitting fix.",
  "riskAssessment": "Low risk. Changes make the code more consistent and predictable by removing complex async retry logic. All three tracking methods now follow the same synchronous pattern. If components aren't ready when setupMissionTracking() is called, tracking won't be installed, but this is acceptable because the tutorial mission is shown when the game is fully initialized.",
  "additionalNotes": "The root cause was the mismatch between synchronous crafting tracking (which worked) and asynchronous mining/exploration tracking (which failed due to timing issues with setTimeout). The fix eliminates this inconsistency by making all tracking methods use the same synchronous immediate-wrapping approach. Added clear comments explaining the fix and warning messages when tracking setup fails."
}
```

DECISION: fix_implemented
