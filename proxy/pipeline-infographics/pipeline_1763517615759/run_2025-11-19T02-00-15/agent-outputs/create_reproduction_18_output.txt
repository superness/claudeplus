Perfect! The reproduction script is now ready. Let me create a summary document:

## Mission Tracker Regression - Reproduction Script Created

I've created an automated bug reproduction script: **`test_mission_tracker_mining_regression.js`**

### What This Script Tests

The script reproduces the **mining mission tracker regression bug** by:

1. **Getting initial mission state** - Verifies mining objective exists and is incomplete
2. **Finding a mineral field** - Locates a tritanium field (or any available field)
3. **Teleporting to mining range** - Places ship 100m from field (within 500m mining range)
4. **Starting mining** - Initiates mining operation
5. **Waiting for mining** - Allows 15 seconds to collect resources
6. **Checking inventory** - Verifies tritanium was actually mined
7. **Stopping mining** - Ends mining operation
8. **Checking mission tracker** - **BUG TEST**: Verifies if mining objective updated

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:** 
- Mining objective progress should update from 0 to the amount of tritanium mined
- Mission tracker should show ✅ when target is reached

**Actual (Bug):**
- Tritanium IS mined and appears in inventory
- Mission tracker progress remains at 0
- Mission objective stays ⬜ (incomplete)

### Bug Reproduction Logic

The script detects the bug with this condition:
```javascript
if (evidence.tritaniumMined > 0 && miningProgress === 0) {
  // BUG REPRODUCED: Mining happened but tracker didn't update
  return false;
}
```

### Exploration Note

**Anomaly exploration testing is NOT included** because:
- No automation command exists for scanning/completing anomalies
- `getSceneInfo` doesn't return nearby anomalies
- Would require implementing new command: `exploreAnomaly` or similar

### Evidence Collection

When the bug is reproduced, the script saves:
- **Complete command history** with all parameters and responses
- **Parsed console logs** from Chrome DevTools
- **Error counts** (console errors and exceptions)
- **Mining objective state** (before and after mining)
- **Actual tritanium mined** vs mission tracker progress

### Running the Script

```bash
node test_mission_tracker_mining_regression.js
```

The script will:
- Launch Chrome via ChromeManager
- Connect to game via WebSocket
- Execute test sequence automatically
- Save evidence to `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
- Exit with status indicating if bug was reproduced

### Next Steps

1. **Run the script** to confirm bug reproduction
2. **Examine console logs** in evidence file for hook installation messages
3. **Check timing** - Are hooks installed before/after mining starts?
4. **Verify hook execution** - Do hooks fire when `addResource()` is called?

**DECISION: script_ready**

The reproduction script is complete and ready to execute. It will automatically test the mining mission tracker regression and provide detailed evidence if the bug is reproduced.
