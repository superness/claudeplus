Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the mission tracker regression bug. Here's what it does:

## Script Overview: `test_mission_tracker_regression.js`

### What It Tests

The script reproduces the regression where mining and anomaly exploration mission steps stopped updating after the crafting/fitting fix:

1. **Mining Objective Test** (Steps 2-9):
   - Finds a mineral field
   - Mines tritanium (waits 10 seconds to collect resources)
   - Checks if the mining mission objective updates (⬜ → ✅)
   - **Bug reproduced if:** Tritanium was mined but objective remains ⬜

2. **Exploration Objective Test** (Steps 10-14):
   - Finds a quantum anomaly
   - Explores it (teleports near and waits for trigger)
   - Checks if exploration mission objective updates (⬜ → ✅)
   - **Bug reproduced if:** Anomaly explored but objective remains ⬜

3. **Crafting Objective Test** (Steps 15-20):
   - Docks at station
   - Crafts and fits a mining laser
   - Checks if crafting mission objective updates (⬜ → ✅)
   - **Verifies:** The fix for crafting is still working

### Key Features

✅ **Comprehensive tracking**: Captures initial state, intermediate states, and final state of all mission objectives

✅ **Console log analysis**: Automatically captures console logs to see if mission tracking hooks are firing

✅ **Graceful degradation**: Skips exploration test if no anomalies are found (doesn't fail entire test)

✅ **Clear evidence**: Shows exactly which objectives updated and which didn't

✅ **Summary report**: At the end, prints a clear summary:
```
📊 TEST SUMMARY:
Mining objective updated: ❌ NO (BUG)
Exploration objective updated: ❌ NO (BUG)
Crafting objective updated: ✅ YES
```

### How to Run

```bash
node test_mission_tracker_regression.js
```

The script will:
1. Launch Chrome with the game
2. Wait for game to load and connect
3. Execute all test steps automatically
4. Save evidence to `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
5. Show console log summary with error counts

### Evidence Collected

The evidence JSON will contain:
- `initialMissionState`: Mission objectives before any actions
- `tritaniumMined`: Amount of tritanium collected
- `missionStateAfterMining`: Mission state after mining
- `missionStateAfterExploration`: Mission state after exploration
- `finalMissionState`: Complete mission state at end
- `bugReproduced`: Which objective failed to update
- `consoleLogs`: Full browser console output
- `consoleErrorCount`: Number of console errors

This will help identify if the tracking hooks are even being installed and if they're firing when actions occur!

**DECISION: script_ready**
