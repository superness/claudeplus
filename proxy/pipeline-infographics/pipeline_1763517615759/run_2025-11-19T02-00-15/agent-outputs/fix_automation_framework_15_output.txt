Perfect! Now let me create a clear summary of the framework fix:

## Framework Fix Complete

### Problem Identified
The test framework had **incorrect hardcoded range values** that caused mining and exploration operations to fail before the actual mission tracker bug could be tested.

### Root Cause
```
❌ Test had incorrect values:
- Mining range: ~2500m (WRONG)
- Exploration range: ~5000m (WRONG)
- Teleport offset: 500m (at or beyond actual range limits)

✅ Actual game values:
- Mining range: 500m (Ship.js:1018, ResourceManager.js:20)
- Exploration range: 500m (InteractionManager.js:10)
- Required: Ship must be < 500m from target
```

### The Issue
When the test teleported the ship **500m away** from targets, it placed the ship **at or beyond the maximum range**. This caused:
- `startMining()` to fail with "Not within mining range" error
- Test to abort at step 5 before reaching the actual mission tracker validation

### Fix Applied
Changed all teleport offsets from **500m → 100m** in `test_mission_tracker_regression.js`:

1. **Line 96**: Mineral field X-offset: `+ 500` → `+ 100`
2. **Line 232**: Anomaly X-offset: `+ 500` → `+ 100`
3. **Lines 38-41**: Updated documentation comments with correct range values
4. **Lines 101, 241**: Updated console log messages to reflect accurate ranges

### Expected Outcome
✅ Ship now teleports to **100m from targets** (well within 500m range)  
✅ Mining command should succeed  
✅ Exploration should trigger automatically  
✅ All 20 test steps should execute and validate mission tracker updates  

### Files Modified
- `test_mission_tracker_regression.js` (5 changes)
- `test_framework_fix_summary.json` (created for documentation)
