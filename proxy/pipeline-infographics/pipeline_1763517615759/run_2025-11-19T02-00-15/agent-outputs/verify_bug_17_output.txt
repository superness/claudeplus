## Evidence Analysis Report

### Evidence Checklist Verification

Let me verify the mandatory evidence requirements:

1. ✅ **Evidence file exists**: `bug_evidence_1763519277187.json` is present
2. ✅ **Evidence contains "commands" array**: Yes, 7 WebSocket commands with responses
3. ❌ **bugReproduced or BUG_REPRODUCED status**: Status is `"FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED"`
4. ✅ **Console log file path**: `"C:\\Users\\super\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ChromeTest_1763411549485\\chrome_debug.log"`
5. ✅ **Console logs array populated**: 5 console error entries
6. ⚠️ **Test script executed**: Partially (7/20 commands before disconnect)
7. ⚠️ **Runtime state snapshots**: Partial (mission state, inventory, mining attempt captured)

### Critical Findings

#### WebSocket Command Analysis

**Commands Executed (7 total):**
1. ✅ `getMissionTrackerUI` - Success (captured initial state)
2. ✅ `getSceneInfo` - Success (50 mineral fields found)
3. ✅ `setNavigationTarget` - Success (targeted mineral_field_5 at 1855m)
4. ✅ `setPosition` - Success (teleported within 100m of target)
5. ✅ `startMining` - Success (response: `"mining": true, "resourceType": "common"`)
6. ✅ `wait` - Success (waited 10 seconds)
7. ✅ `getInventory` - Success (captured: 0 tritanium, 83 pyerite)

**Game Disconnected**: After command 7, WebSocket closed (code: 1006)

#### Console Log Analysis

**Console Error Count**: 5
**Console Exception Count**: 0

**Error Types**: All errors are Chrome GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) push notification errors:
- `"DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT"` (3 occurrences)
- `"Authentication Failed: wrong_secret"` (1 occurrence)
- `"Failed to log in to GCM"` (1 occurrence)

**Error Correlation**: ❌ NO game-related errors. All errors are browser infrastructure (unrelated to game logic).

#### Bug Evidence Analysis

**Expected Behavior**: After mining 1000 units of tritanium, mission tracker should update:
- ⬜ Successfully mine 1000 units of Tritanium → ✅ Successfully mine 1000 units of Tritanium

**Actual Behavior Captured**:
1. ✅ Mission tracker UI captured (all 4 objectives ⬜ incomplete)
2. ✅ Mining command succeeded (`"mining": true`)
3. ❌ **CRITICAL**: After 10 seconds of mining, inventory shows **0 tritanium collected**
4. ⚠️ Game disconnected before mission tracker could be re-checked

**Mining System Failure Detected**:
- Mining started successfully (WebSocket response: `success: true`)
- Field identified: `mineral_field_5` of type `common`
- Ship positioned within 100m (well within 500m mining range)
- Waited 10 seconds for resource collection
- **Result: 0 tritanium in inventory**

#### Root Cause Indicators

**PRIMARY ISSUE**: Mining system is NOT collecting resources
- This is a **different bug** than the mission tracker update bug
- If mining doesn't collect resources, the mission tracker CAN'T update (nothing to track)
- Console shows NO JavaScript errors during mining attempt
- WebSocket response claims mining started, but no resources collected

**SECONDARY ISSUE**: Cannot verify mission tracker bug due to framework error
- Test terminated prematurely (game disconnected)
- Never reached the point where mission tracker should update
- No evidence of mission tracker checking after mining attempt

### Console Log Insights

1. ✅ Console logs captured successfully from Chrome debug session
2. ❌ **NO game-specific errors** - All errors are Chrome GCM infrastructure
3. ❌ **NO JavaScript exceptions** during mining attempt
4. ⚠️ Mining appears "successful" from WebSocket perspective but produces no resources
5. ⚠️ Game disconnection may indicate deeper stability issue

### Evidence Completeness Assessment

**Runtime Evidence Present**: ✅ YES (partial)
- WebSocket commands/responses captured
- Game state snapshots captured (mission UI, inventory, scene)
- Mining attempt captured with response data

**Console Logs Present**: ✅ YES
- Console log file path recorded
- 5 console errors captured (all unrelated to game)
- No JavaScript exceptions during test

**Bug Reproduction**: ❌ NO
- Test discovered a **different bug** (mining resource collection failure)
- Original bug (mission tracker updates) could NOT be tested
- Framework error prevented full test execution

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

**Reason**: Test execution discovered a **prerequisite system failure** (mining resource collection) that prevents verification of the original bug (mission tracker updates). The test framework also encountered a game disconnection error after only 7/20 commands. While we have runtime evidence and console logs, we cannot confirm the mission tracker regression because the mining system itself is broken. The evidence reveals a different, blocking bug that must be fixed before the original bug can be tested.
