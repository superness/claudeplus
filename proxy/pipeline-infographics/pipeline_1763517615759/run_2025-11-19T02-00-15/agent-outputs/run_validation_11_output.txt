## Key Findings

### Bug Reproduced: Mining Not Working
- ✅ **Mining started successfully** (response: `mining: true, fieldId: mineral_field_37, resourceType: uncommon`)
- ❌ **No tritanium collected** after 10 seconds of mining
- ⬜ **Mission objective remained incomplete** (mining mission step not updated)

### Test Execution Issues
1. **Game disconnected prematurely**: WebSocket connection closed (code 1006) before exploration and crafting tests could run
2. **Only mining test completed**: Test ended after checking inventory showed 0 tritanium
3. **Console errors**: 5 Chrome-related errors (GCM registration, not game-related)

### Evidence Quality
✅ Console log file captured: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`  
✅ Evidence JSON complete with all command responses  
✅ Initial mission state documented  
⚠️ Test incomplete due to early disconnection

### Root Cause Analysis Needed
The evidence shows:
1. Mining **API call succeeds** (startMining returns success)
2. Mining **does not collect resources** (tritanium = 0 after 10s)
3. This suggests the bug is **deeper than mission tracking** - mining itself appears broken

**DECISION: execution_complete**
