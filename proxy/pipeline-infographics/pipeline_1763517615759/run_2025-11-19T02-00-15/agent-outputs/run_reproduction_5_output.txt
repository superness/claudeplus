### What Happened

The test script executed successfully through most steps:
1. ✅ Environment setup
2. ✅ Chrome launched with ChromeManager
3. ✅ WebSocket connected
4. ✅ Initial mission state captured
5. ✅ Mineral field found
6. ✅ Navigation set
7. ✅ Teleported to mining range
8. ✅ Mining started
9. ✅ Waited 10 seconds for mining
10. ❌ **Failed when checking inventory**

### The Error

At line 133 of `test_mission_tracker_regression.js`, the script tried to parse the response from `getResources()`:

```javascript
const tritaniumQty = r.resources.find(res => res.type === 'tritanium')?.quantity || 0;
```

**Error:** `TypeError: r.resources.find is not a function`

This means `r.resources` is not an array as expected. The response data structure from the game doesn't match what the script expected.

### Root Cause

The reproduction script has a bug in its command handler - it expects the response from `getResources()` to have a structure like:
```javascript
{ resources: [{type: 'tritanium', quantity: 1000}, ...] }
```

But the actual response is in a different format (possibly `resources` is an object, not an array, or the structure is different).

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
