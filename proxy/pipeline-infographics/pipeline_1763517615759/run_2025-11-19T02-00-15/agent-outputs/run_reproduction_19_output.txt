### Bug Reproduction Results

✅ **BUG SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED**

**What the test did:**
1. Got initial mission state (mining objective at 0/1000)
2. Found nearest mineral field (1.2km away)
3. Teleported ship to mining range (100m from field)
4. Started mining operation
5. Waited 15 seconds for resource collection
6. Verified inventory: **100 units of tritanium mined**
7. Stopped mining
8. Checked mission tracker: **Still at 0/1000** ❌

**Bug Confirmed:**
- Mining IS working: 100 units of tritanium collected
- Mission tracker IS NOT updating: Progress remained at 0/1000
- Expected: Progress should show 100/1000
- Actual: Progress shows 0/1000

**Evidence Collected:**
- ✅ Complete command history (8 commands)
- ✅ Console logs captured (5 entries)
- ✅ Mission state before and after mining
- ✅ Inventory state showing tritanium mined
- ✅ Console log file exists (2.4MB)

**Console Errors (Non-Critical):**
- 5 Chrome GCM registration errors (unrelated to bug)
- No game-related console errors or exceptions

### Next Steps

The bug has been successfully reproduced. The evidence file contains:
- Full mission state snapshots before/after mining
- Proof that mining collected resources (100 tritanium)
- Proof that mission tracker did NOT update (0/1000 progress)

This confirms the regression: **mining mission hooks are not firing when resources are collected**.
