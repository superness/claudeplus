Perfect! So the method is `addResource` (singular), and the current code correctly tries to hook into it. But wait - let me check if the issue is that the method isn't being called or if the tracking setup itself is failing. Let me look at the current tracking code one more time to spot the actual regression:

Looking at lines 957-979 in `UniverseIntegrationManager.js`:
```javascript
if (resourceManager && !resourceManager._miningTracked && resourceManager.addResource) {
    const originalAddResource = resourceManager.addResource.bind(resourceManager);
    resourceManager.addResource = (resourceType, amount) => {
        const result = originalAddResource(resourceType, amount);
        // ... tracking code ...
        return result;
    };
    resourceManager._miningTracked = true;
    console.log('🔍 QUEST-TRACK: ✅ Mining tracking activated');
    return true;
}
```

And lines 1016-1037 for exploration tracking has similar structure. The issue must be that **BOTH tracking functions are now being called correctly, but something is preventing them from actually executing when mining/exploration happens**.

Wait! I need to check if maybe the `setupMissionTracking` function is not being called at all, or if it's being called but the hooks aren't working. Let me check when missions are generated:

Based on my analysis, I now have enough information to provide the bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Mission tracker mining and exploration updates broken after crafting/fitting fix",
  "expectedBehavior": "Mission tracker should update and show ✅ for mining (1000 units Tritanium) and exploration (first quantum anomaly) objectives when player performs those actions",
  "actualBehavior": "Mining and exploration mission steps remain ⬜ (incomplete) even after performing the actions. Only the crafting/fitting step shows ✅ (complete). Console logs from trackMiningActions() and trackExplorationActions() likely show successful hook installation but the hooks may not be firing when actions occur, OR the hooks are being installed AFTER the mission is already active, OR there's a timing issue where the window.simulator components aren't available yet.",

  ],
  "hypothesis": "The regression was introduced when the crafting/fitting tracking was fixed. The likely root cause is one of:\n\n1. TIMING ISSUE: The setupMissionTracking() method hooks (trackMiningActions, trackExplorationActions) are being called BEFORE window.simulator.resourceManager and window.simulator.anomalyExplorer are fully initialized. The retry logic exists but may have incorrect timing or max retry limits.\n\n2. HOOK OVERWRITE: Another system (like PlayerProgressionManager or QuantumUniverseIntegration) may be wrapping the same methods AFTER UniverseIntegrationManager sets up its hooks, causing the mission tracking hooks to be overwritten and never called.\n\n3. METHOD NAME MISMATCH: The old tracking code used 'addResources' (plural) but was changed to 'addResource' (singular). There may be a mismatch where mining actually calls a different method name.\n\n4. CONDITIONAL LOGIC BUG: The tracking functions check for !resourceManager._miningTracked and !anomalyExplorer._questTracked flags. If these flags are being set elsewhere or persisting across game sessions, the hooks won't be installed.\n\nMost likely: Option 1 (timing) or Option 2 (hook overwrite), as the crafting fix likely changed the initialization order or added new method wrapping that interferes with the existing mining/exploration hooks."
