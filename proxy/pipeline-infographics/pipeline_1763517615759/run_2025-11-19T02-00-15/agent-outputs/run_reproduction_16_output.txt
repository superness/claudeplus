## Key Observations

### Test Environment
- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` (no caching)
- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed
- ✅ Reproduction script found and executed
- ✅ Console logs captured successfully

### Test Execution
The test partially completed before the game disconnected:

1. **Initial State** ✅
   - Mission tracker found with 4 objectives
   - All objectives showing ⬜ (incomplete)
   - Mining objective: "Successfully mine 1000 units of Tritanium"

2. **Mining Test** ⚠️
   - Found mineral field: `mineral_field_5` at 1855km
   - Set navigation target successfully
   - Teleported within mining range (100m offset)
   - Mining started: **YES** (field type: `common`)
   - Waited 10 seconds for mining
   - **Tritanium collected: 0 units** ❌
   - Inventory had 83 pyerite but 0 tritanium

3. **Game Disconnected** ❌
   - WebSocket disconnected (code: 1006)
   - Test terminated at step 7 of 20
   - Never reached exploration or crafting tests

### Critical Finding

**The mining system is NOT collecting resources:**
- Mining command returned success: `"mining": true`
- Field identified as `"resourceType": "common"`
- Ship positioned within 100m (well within 500m mining range)
- Waited 10 seconds for collection
- **Result: 0 tritanium collected**

This suggests the mining system itself may be broken, which would explain why the mission tracker doesn't update - there's nothing to track!

### Console Logs
The 5 console errors are all Chrome GCM/push notification errors (unrelated to game):
- `DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT`
- `Authentication Failed: wrong_secret`
- `Failed to log in to GCM`

No game-specific errors were captured before disconnect.

---

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The test revealed a **mining system failure** (0 resources collected) but the game disconnected before we could determine if the mission tracker would update. The early disconnect prevents us from testing the anomaly exploration and crafting objectives.

**Recommendation:** Fix the mining resource collection issue first, then re-run the test to check if mission tracker updates work.
