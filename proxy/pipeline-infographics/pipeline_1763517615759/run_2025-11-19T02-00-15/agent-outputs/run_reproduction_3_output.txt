## Execution Summary

**Result**: Framework error - game disconnected during test execution

**Environment**:
- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` (no caching)
- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed
- ✅ Working directory correct
- ✅ WebSocket server initialized

**Test Progress**:
1. ✓ Initial mission state captured (all objectives ⬜ incomplete)
2. ✓ Found mineral field (mineral_field_21 at 1103km)
3. ✓ Set navigation target
4. ✓ Teleported near mineral field
5. ✗ **Mining failed** - "No mineral fields in range"
6. ✗ **Game disconnected** before test could continue

**Evidence Captured**:
- Initial mission state: All 4 objectives incomplete (⬜)
- Console logs: 5 entries (Chrome GCM authentication errors - not game-related)
- Test limitation: Teleport offset (5000m) placed ship beyond mining range
- Game disconnected before mining/exploration/crafting tests could complete

**Framework Issue**:
The reproduction script has a bug in the teleport distance calculation. The 5000m offset placed the ship too far from the mineral field (beyond mining range ~2500m). The game then disconnected, possibly due to the failed mining command or an unrelated WebSocket issue.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
