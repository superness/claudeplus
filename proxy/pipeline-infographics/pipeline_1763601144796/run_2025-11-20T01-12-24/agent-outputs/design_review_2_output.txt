ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates a solid grasp of the task - creating a block_validator agent to monitor and verify the complete block discovery and validation lifecycle in a mining pool system.

2. **Logical Approach**: The methodology is sound - first reading the specification document, then examining existing agents to understand structure patterns, then gathering codebase context before designing the new agent.

3. **Comprehensive Step Breakdown**: The plan includes all required verification points from the user's requirements:
   - Monitor for block solutions ✓
   - Verify pool submits block to daemon ✓
   - Check daemon accepts block ✓
   - Confirm block in blockchain ✓
   - Validate coinbase transaction ✓
   - Verify wallet receives reward ✓

4. **Good Research Strategy**: Plans to use multiple Grep searches to understand block submission, coinbase handling, and daemon interaction patterns in the actual codebase.

5. **Thoughtful Error Handling**: Test considerations show awareness of real-world failure scenarios (orphan blocks, submission failures, delayed credits).

6. **Proper Decision Mapping**: Correctly identifies the five required decision outcomes and considers error flow paths.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence Specification Could Be More Concrete**: While the evidence list mentions "will show" and "will demonstrate," it doesn't specify exact verification criteria. For example:
   - What specific fields/properties must be present in the JSON?
   - What validates that all 7 requirement points are actually implemented in the steps?
   - How will we verify the decision routing is correct?

2. **Missing Validation Step**: No explicit plan to validate the generated JSON is syntactically correct and follows the exact schema of existing agents.

3. **Medium-High Confidence Hedge**: The confidence level shows some uncertainty about implementation details, which is reasonable but suggests the plan may need iteration.

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong (with minor gaps)**

The proposed evidence covers:
- ✓ Source documentation (section 2.3)
- ✓ Structural examples (existing agents)
- ✓ Implementation patterns (grep results)
- ✓ Final artifact (complete JSON file)
- ⚠ Missing: Explicit verification that the JSON matches the required schema and includes all 7 verification requirements

The evidence would be stronger with:
- A checklist mapping each user requirement to specific agent steps
- JSON schema validation confirmation
- Verification that all 5 decision points are properly configured

**Overall Assessment:**
This is a well-thought-out plan with a logical flow and comprehensive coverage of the requirements. The approach shows domain knowledge about mining pools and agent design. The minor gaps in evidence specification are not fatal - the core validation points are clear and the plan is executable. The research phase should provide sufficient information to create a complete, working agent.

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong**

**DECISION: APPROVED**

The plan demonstrates clear understanding, has a methodical approach with concrete steps, and will produce verifiable evidence of completion. While evidence specification could be slightly more detailed, the plan is sound and should successfully deliver the required block_validator agent.

DECISION: APPROVED
