Perfect! The block_validator agent has been successfully created. Let me provide a final summary:

## Block Validator Agent - Complete

I have successfully created the **block_validator** agent based on section 2.3 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The agent is a comprehensive validation specialist that monitors and verifies the complete block discovery lifecycle in a cryptocurrency mining pool.

### Agent Capabilities

The agent validates all 6 required stages:

1. **Block Discovery** - Monitors pool logs and database for block solutions found by miners
2. **Pool Submission** - Verifies pool submits block to daemon via `submitblock` RPC
3. **Daemon Acceptance** - Checks daemon validates and accepts the block
4. **Blockchain Confirmation** - Confirms block appears in blockchain with confirmations
5. **Coinbase Validation** - Validates coinbase transaction structure and pool address
6. **Wallet Credit** - Verifies mining reward is credited to pool wallet after maturity

### Key Features

- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Every stage requires concrete evidence (logs, RPC responses, blockchain data)
- **Error Detection**: Handles block rejection, orphaning, and wallet credit failures
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Includes exact bash commands for bitcoin-cli interactions
- **Stage-by-Stage Process**: Systematic validation from discovery through wallet credit
- **Regtest Optimization**: Includes shortcuts for fast validation in test environments
- **Clear Decision Routing**: 5 decision paths (block_found, block_accepted, block_rejected, wallet_credited, error)

### Technical Implementation

**Permissions**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

**Key Validations**:
- CoiniumServ log analysis for block discovery events
- Bitcoin daemon RPC interaction (getbestblockhash, getblock, submitblock)
- Coinbase transaction structure verification
- Wallet balance tracking and UTXO verification
- Block maturity monitoring (100 confirmations)

### File Location

✓ Created at: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/block_validator.json`
✓ JSON syntax: Valid
✓ All requirements: Met

The agent is production-ready and follows the established agent architecture patterns from the claudeplus system.
