UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a block_validator agent based on section 2.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent needs to verify the complete block discovery and validation cycle in a mining pool system, monitoring from block discovery through to wallet reward crediting.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.3 specifications
2. Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the structure and patterns used
3. Design the block_validator agent with appropriate steps, tools, and decision points
4. Create validation logic for each stage of the block lifecycle
5. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 2.3
2) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files: pattern "agents/*.json" or "claudeplus/agents/*.json"
3) Use Read tool on 2-3 existing agent files to understand the JSON structure, step format, tool usage patterns, and decision routing
4) Use Grep to search for block-related code in the codebase: pattern "block.*submit|submitblock" to understand how blocks are submitted
5) Use Grep to search for coinbase transaction handling: pattern "coinbase|generation.*transaction"
6) Use Grep to search for daemon interaction patterns: pattern "daemon.*accept|getblock"
7) Design agent steps:
   - Step 1: Monitor for block solution events/logs
   - Step 2: Verify pool submitted block to daemon
   - Step 3: Check daemon accepted the block
   - Step 4: Confirm block appears in blockchain
   - Step 5: Validate coinbase transaction structure
   - Step 6: Verify wallet received mining reward
8) Map decision points: block_found → block_accepted → block_rejected (error path) → wallet_credited → error (fallback)
9) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/block_validator.json with complete agent specification

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Handle scenario where block is found but submission fails
- Handle scenario where daemon rejects the block (orphan/stale)
- Handle scenario where block is accepted but wallet credit is delayed
- Verify proper error handling and logging at each validation step
- Test with different block discovery methods (solo vs pooled mining)
- Validate timeout handling for blockchain confirmation delays
- Ensure agent can distinguish between valid rejections and errors

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the content of section 2.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will demonstrate understanding of existing agent structure by showing examples
- Will show relevant code patterns found for block submission and validation
- Will provide the complete agent JSON with all steps, tools, and decision routing
- Will verify the file is written to correct path with proper JSON formatting

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires understanding the mining pool architecture and block lifecycle, which depends on the specific implementation details in the codebase and documentation. The agent structure should follow established patterns, but the specific validation steps need to align with how this particular mining pool software handles blocks. Confidence will increase after reading section 2.3 and examining existing code patterns.

DECISION: design_complete
