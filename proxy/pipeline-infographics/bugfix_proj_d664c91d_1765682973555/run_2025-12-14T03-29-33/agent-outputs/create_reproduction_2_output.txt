## Bug Reproduction Script Created

I've created a Playwright test that will:

1. **Load the game** in a real browser
2. **Spawn a Chaos Marine** (purple faction enemy as mentioned in the bug report)
3. **Kill the enemy** by repeatedly using skills
4. **Wait for the death animation** to play (~2 seconds)
5. **Capture all console errors** during this period
6. **Check for the specific Three.js error**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')" in `refreshUniformsCommon`

The test will **FAIL if the bug exists** (errors found) and **PASS if the bug is fixed** (no errors).

### To run this reproduction:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client
npx playwright test reproduce-threejs-uniform-bug.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

The test will spawn an actual Chaos enemy, kill it with skills, and observe whether the Three.js rendering crashes with the uniform access error during the death animation - exactly replicating the conditions from the bug report.
