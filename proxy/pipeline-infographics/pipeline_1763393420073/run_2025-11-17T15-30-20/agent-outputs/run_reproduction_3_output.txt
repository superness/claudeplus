### Bug Reproduction Evidence

#### **Test Sequence Executed**:
1. ✅ Game loaded successfully (WebSocket server on port 8765)
2. ✅ Test client connected to game
3. ✅ Initial ship state captured
4. ✅ Throttle set to 50%
5. ✅ Wait 1 second for physics to apply
6. ✅ Ship state checked after throttle
7. ✅ Throttle reset to 0%
8. ✅ Navigation target set to (5000, 0, 5000) at 7071m distance
9. ✅ Wait 3 seconds for ship movement
10. ✅ Final ship state captured

### **BUG CONFIRMATION**

#### **Symptom 1: Throttle Not Affecting Velocity**
- **Initial State** (Line 14-43):
  - Position: `(0, 0, 0)`
  - Velocity: `(0, 0, 0)`
  - Throttle: `0`

- **After Setting Throttle to 50%** (Line 84-116):
  - Position: `(0, 0, 0)` ← No change
  - Velocity: `(0, 0, 0)` ← **BUG: Should have non-zero velocity**
  - Throttle: `0.5` ← Throttle was set successfully

- **Evidence**: Line 254
  ```json
  "throttleIssue": "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"
  ```

#### **Symptom 2: Ship Not Moving Despite Navigation Command**
- **Navigation Target Set** (Line 151-177):
  - Target: `(5000, 0, 5000)`
  - Distance: `7071m`
  - Mode: `approach`
  - Command Status: `success: true`

- **After 3 Seconds of Physics Updates** (Line 196-228):
  - Position: `(0, 0, 0)` ← **BUG: Ship did not move**
  - Velocity: `(0, 0, 0)` ← **BUG: No velocity applied**
  - Distance Moved: `0m` (Line 273)

#### **Symptom 3: Ship Orientation Not Changing**
- **Initial Rotation** (Line 25-29): `quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1)`
- **Final Rotation** (Line 210-214): `quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1)` ← **No rotation change**

### **Bug Details Summary** (Line 276-281)
```json
{
  "issue": "Ship position did not change after setNavigationTarget command",
  "distanceMoved": 0,
  "expectedBehavior": "Ship should have moved toward target (5000, 0, 5000)",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remained nearly stationary (moved only 0.00m)"
}
```

### **Root Cause Indicators**

From the browser console logs captured during execution:
1. ✅ Game systems initialized successfully
2. ✅ Physics engine loaded (`EVEPhysics.js`, `ShipPhysics.js`)
3. ✅ Player ship created: `atron` class
4. ✅ Input handling initialized
5. ✅ Automation commands received and acknowledged
6. ❌ **No physics updates being applied to ship position/velocity**

---

### **Critical Findings**

1. **Throttle Command Works** ✅
   - The `setThrottle` command successfully sets the throttle value (0.5)
   - Response: `"Throttle set to 50%"` (Line 59)

2. **Navigation Command Works** ✅
   - The `setNavigationTarget` command is accepted
   - Response: `"Navigation target set to (5000, 0, 5000) at 7071m - mode: approach"` (Line 171)

3. **Physics Pipeline Broken** ❌
   - Throttle value is not being translated to velocity
   - Navigation target is not causing ship to orient and move
   - Ship remains stationary at origin `(0, 0, 0)` with zero velocity

---

### **Affected Systems**

Based on evidence, the following systems are likely broken:
1. **Input → Physics Translation**: Throttle input not creating acceleration
2. **Navigation → Physics**: Navigation target not triggering movement
3. **Physics Update Loop**: Ship velocity/position not being updated per frame
4. **Orientation System**: Ship rotation not being updated to face navigation target

---

### **Next Steps Required**

The bug has been **conclusively reproduced**. The reproduction script collected comprehensive evidence showing:
- ✅ Commands are being received
- ✅ Commands are being acknowledged
- ❌ Commands are NOT affecting ship physics state
- ❌ Ship remains frozen at origin despite valid navigation commands

**Recommendation**: Proceed to diagnostic phase to investigate:
1. Physics update loop execution
2. Ship physics component integration
3. Throttle → acceleration translation
4. Navigation → orientation calculation
