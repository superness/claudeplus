Based on my analysis of the ship movement system, I can now provide a complete bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship throttle controls (W/S keys) do not affect ship velocity - ship remains stationary despite throttle input and navigation commands",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player adjusts throttle using W/S keys or sets navigation targets, the ship should accelerate and move in the specified direction at the requested speed. Ship orientation should rotate to face the direction of travel.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary (velocity stays at 0) even when throttle is increased via W/S keys. Ship orientation does not update when it should be moving. Throttle input is received by InputManager but does not result in actual ship movement.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "InputManager (throttle input handling)",
    "Ship entity (navigation and thrust calculation)",
    "ShipPhysics (velocity application)",
    "SceneManager (visual position updates)",
    "SpaceshipSimulator (main update loop)"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser (index.html)",
    "Step 2: Press 'W' key to increase throttle (observe throttle level logged to console)",
    "Step 3: Observe ship HUD - throttle percentage should increase (0% → 10% → 20%...)",
    "Step 4: Observe ship position/velocity in debug info - ship should move but remains at velocity 0",
    "Step 5: Alternatively, double-click on empty space to set navigation target",
    "Step 6: Observe that ship still does not move toward target despite navigation command being set",
    "Step 7: Check console logs - should see navigation commands with speedSetting > 0 but ship velocity remains 0"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Data flow break between InputManager throttle input → Ship thrust calculation → ShipPhysics velocity application. Possible causes:\n\n1. InputManager.getThrustMagnitude() returns throttle value but this may not be properly converted to thrust vector\n2. Ship.updateWithNavigation() calculates thrustVector but may have magnitude field corruption/loss during object spread operations\n3. ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() receives thrustVector but may not properly apply it to targetVelocity calculation\n4. Explicit safeguard in ShipPhysics line 124-128 checks for null thrustInput and sets targetVelocity to zero - this may be triggering incorrectly\n5. Bug fix comment at ShipPhysics:76-92 mentions 'BUGFIX: Explicitly preserve magnitude field' suggesting previous magnitude loss issues\n6. Ship.js:352-359 has another BUGFIX checking for magnitude corruption and restoring it from navigationCommand.speedSetting\n\nMost likely: thrustVector.magnitude is being lost or set to 0 somewhere in the data flow between Ship calculating it and ShipPhysics receiving it, causing ShipPhysics to think there's no thrust input and set targetVelocity to zero."
