### Test Results

#### ❌ BUG STILL PRESENT - Ship Movement Non-Functional

The validation test **successfully reproduced the original bug**, confirming that the ship movement system is still broken:

**Evidence from test execution:**

1. **Throttle Test (Manual Movement)**:
   - ✓ Set throttle to 50% - Command succeeded
   - ✗ **Ship velocity remained 0.0 m/s** after 1 second wait
   - ✗ **Ship position remained at origin (0, 0, 0)**
   - **Bug confirmed**: "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"

2. **Navigation Target Test**:
   - ✓ Set navigation target to (5000, 0, 5000) - Command succeeded
   - ✓ Distance to target: 7071m
   - ✗ **After 3 seconds, ship did not move**
   - ✗ **Distance moved: 0.00m** (expected: > 10m)
   - ✗ **Final velocity: 0.0 m/s** (expected: > 0.1 m/s)

3. **Bug Status**: 
   - `"bugReproduced": true`
   - `"status": "BUG_REPRODUCED"`
   - `"distanceMoved": 0`
   - `"finalVelocityMagnitude": 0`

### Detailed Observations

#### Command Sequence Executed:
1. ✓ `getShipState` - Initial state captured (position: 0,0,0, velocity: 0,0,0)
2. ✓ `setThrottle(50)` - Command accepted, throttle set
3. ⏱ Wait 1000ms for physics to update
4. ✗ `getShipState` - **Velocity still 0,0,0** (should be > 0)
5. ✓ `setThrottle(0)` - Reset throttle
6. ⏱ Wait 500ms
7. ✓ `setNavigationTarget(5000, 0, 5000, "approach")` - Target set at 7071m distance
8. ⏱ Wait 3000ms for ship to move
9. ✗ `getShipState` - **Position still 0,0,0, velocity still 0,0,0**

#### Bug Symptoms Confirmed:
- **Throttle input not affecting ship velocity** ✗
- **Ship remaining stationary despite navigation commands** ✗
- **Ship position not updating** ✗
- **Orientation not visible in state** (rotation always 0,0,0,w:1)

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on the evidence file structure, the issue appears to be in how `GameTestingInterface.js:217` sets the throttle:

**Current Implementation** (line 217):
```javascript
// BUGFIX: Set throttle by updating InputManager.thrustLevel instead of directly setting physics.thrustInput
const normalizedValue = value / 100; // Convert 0-100 to 0-1
this.simulator.inputManager.thrustLevel = normalizedValue;
```

**Problem Identified**:
The fix was implemented in `GameTestingInterface.js`, but the throttle state being returned shows:
```json
"throttle": {
  "x": 0,
  "y": 0, 
  "z": 0,
  "magnitude": 0
}
```

This indicates that `InputManager.thrustLevel` is being set correctly (as evidenced by the success message), but either:
1. The ship physics loop is not reading `InputManager.thrustLevel`
2. The ship movement system requires a navigation target to apply thrust
3. The manual thrust mode (Ship.js:327-342) is not being triggered

---

### Critical Finding

**The throttle is NOT being applied to ship physics**, even though the command succeeds. The evidence shows:

- Line 59: `"message": "Throttle set to 50%"` - Command accepted ✓
- Lines 93-96: `"velocity": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}` - No velocity after 1s ✗
- Lines 104-108: `"throttle": {"magnitude": 0}` - Throttle magnitude still 0 ✗

**This suggests the fix in GameTestingInterface.js is incomplete** - setting `InputManager.thrustLevel` does not propagate to the ship's physics system.

### Additional Data Points

**Game Initialization**: Game loaded successfully with all systems initialized
- ✓ WebSocket automation server connected on port 8765
- ✓ Chrome browser launched with testMode=true
- ✓ GameTestingInterface initialized
- ✓ TestingBrowserBridge connected
- ✓ All quantum universe systems loaded

**Automation Framework**: Working correctly
- ✓ Commands sent and received
- ✓ Responses captured with timestamps
- ✓ Evidence file generated with full command/response log

### Recommendation

**The bug fix implementation is NOT working as intended.** Further investigation needed in:

1. `js/entities/Ship.js` - Manual thrust mode (lines 327-342)
2. `js/core/InputManager.js` - How `thrustLevel` is consumed
3. `js/physics/ShipPhysics.js` - Where thrust vectors are applied

**Next Steps**:
- Verify that `Ship.updateWithNavigation()` actually reads `InputManager.getThrustMagnitude()`
- Check if ship requires `navigationTarget` to be set for movement to occur
- Confirm that the physics update loop is running (check frame counter)
- Add diagnostic logging to track thrust vector calculation
