Excellent! The script is already complete and uses all the available automation commands. Let me verify the command sequence matches the bug requirements:

## Reproduction Script Analysis

The existing script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js` is a comprehensive bug reproduction script that:

### ✓ Uses Available Commands
- `listCommands` - Verifies automation framework
- `getShipState` - Captures initial state, velocity, and position
- `setThrottle` - Sets throttle to 50%, then 0%
- `setNavigationTarget` - Tests navigation system
- `getSceneInfo` - Gathers context
- `resetGameState` - Clean teardown
- `wait` (local command) - Allows physics to update

### ✓ Tests the Bug Symptoms
1. **Throttle not affecting velocity**: Sets throttle to 50%, waits, checks if velocity changed
2. **Ship remaining stationary**: Measures distance moved and verifies it's > 10m
3. **Orientation not updating**: Implicitly tested through navigation target approach

### ✓ Bug Detection Logic
```javascript
// Line 147-156: Detects stationary ship
if (distanceMoved < 10) {
  console.log('\n   ❌ BUG REPRODUCED: Ship did not move after setNavigationTarget!');
  evidence.bugReproduced = true;
  return false;
}

// Line 160-170: Detects zero velocity
if (velMagnitude < 0.1) {
  console.log('\n   ❌ BUG REPRODUCED: Ship has zero velocity after setNavigationTarget!');
  evidence.bugReproduced = true;
  return false;
}
```

### ✓ Evidence Collection
- Saves detailed JSON evidence file with all commands/responses
- Captures initial position, post-throttle state, post-navigation state
- Logs distance moved and velocity magnitude
- Exit code 0 = bug reproduced or not reproduced (deterministic)

### ✓ WebSocket Architecture
- Starts WebSocket server on port 8765
- Handles game connection and test client connection
- Routes commands from test → game
- Routes responses from game → test
- Includes detailed logging for debugging

### Command Sequence:
```json
[
  {"command": "listCommands", "expectedResult": "Automation framework verified"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Initial state: position, velocity, throttle"},
  {"command": "setThrottle", "params": {"value": 50}, "expectedResult": "Throttle set to 50%"},
  {"command": "wait", "params": {"duration": 1000}, "expectedResult": "Wait 1s"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Check if velocity changed (should be > 0)"},
  {"command": "setThrottle", "params": {"value": 0}, "expectedResult": "Reset throttle"},
  {"command": "wait", "params": {"duration": 500}, "expectedResult": "Wait 0.5s"},
  {"command": "setNavigationTarget", "params": {"x": 5000, "y": 0, "z": 5000, "mode": "approach"}, "expectedResult": "Navigation target set"},
  {"command": "wait", "params": {"duration": 3000}, "expectedResult": "Wait 3s for ship to move"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Verify ship moved (distance > 10m, velocity > 0.1 m/s)"},
  {"command": "getSceneInfo", "expectedResult": "Scene context gathered"},
  {"command": "resetGameState", "params": {"preserveInventory": true}, "expectedResult": "Clean teardown"}
]
```

### Expected Outcome:
**Bug reproduced when:**
- Ship distance moved < 10m after navigation command (line 147)
- OR ship velocity magnitude < 0.1 m/s after navigation command (line 160)
- OR velocity remains near zero after throttle is set (line 86-89 warning)

### Evidence Files:
- `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json` - Contains full command/response log with bug details

**DECISION: script_ready**
