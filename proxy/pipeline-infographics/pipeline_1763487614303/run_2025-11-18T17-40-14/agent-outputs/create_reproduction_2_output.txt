I see there's already a script for the ship fitting bug. This script appears to be testing a different aspect of the bug (ID mismatch). Based on the user's report, they specifically mentioned two issues:

1. **Missing UI slots** - The equipment slots are not visible in the UI
2. **Double-click fitting fails** with TypeError at StationUI.js:1605

The existing script tests the TypeError but through the API, not through UI double-click. Since I cannot create commands for UI element visibility checking or double-click simulation (these would require DOM manipulation), I'll note this limitation.

The current script already tests what can be tested - the backend fitting logic and checking for console errors. This is the best we can do with the available commands.
