Looking at the reproduction_creator output, I can see they indicated `DECISION: need_command_implementation`, but the issue is that **the commands needed cannot be implemented** because they require DOM/UI manipulation that the current automation system doesn't support.

The reproduction_creator identified that the bug requires:
1. **Checking if UI slots are visible** - requires DOM inspection
2. **Simulating double-click on UI elements** - requires DOM event simulation

These are UI-level operations that cannot be tested through the current `GameTestingInterface.js` which only provides game logic/API commands. The current system can test backend fitting logic (which the existing script already does), but cannot test UI rendering or UI interactions.

Let me analyze what the reproduction_creator actually needs:

From the bug report, the issues are:
1. **Missing UI slots** - A visual/rendering issue
2. **Double-click fitting fails** - A UI interaction issue with a backend error

The existing test script already tests the backend `fitItem` API. What's missing is the ability to:
- Check if DOM elements (slot containers) are visible
- Simulate a double-click event on an inventory item element

Since these cannot be automated with the current command system, I need to make a decision:

**DECISION: cannot_implement**

Here's my analysis:

```json
{
  "reason": "The bug requires testing UI visibility and UI interactions (double-click events on DOM elements) which cannot be automated through the current GameTestingInterface command system",
  "missingGameFeature": "The automation system only provides access to game logic APIs (ship state, inventory, fitting backend) but has no capability to inspect DOM elements, check CSS visibility, or simulate UI events like double-clicks on specific DOM elements",
  "recommendedApproach": "This bug requires manual testing or a different testing approach:\n\n1. Manual Testing:\n   - Open the game in browser\n   - Dock at a station\n   - Open ship fitting UI\n   - Visually check if equipment slots are rendered\n   - Try double-clicking an item from inventory\n   - Check browser console for errors\n\n2. Automated Testing (requires new infrastructure):\n   - Use browser automation tools like Puppeteer/Playwright\n   - Write E2E tests that can interact with actual DOM\n   - Check element visibility with CSS selectors\n   - Simulate mouse events (click, double-click)\n\n3. Current Script Limitations:\n   - The existing test_ship_fitting_bug.js script tests backend fitting API\n   - It successfully tests that fitItem() works programmatically\n   - It cannot test UI rendering or UI interaction issues\n   - For this specific bug, the backend test passes but UI might still be broken\n\nThe automation command implementer cannot add commands for DOM manipulation because the GameTestingInterface operates at the game logic level, not the UI/DOM level.",
  "existingTestCoverage": "The current script tests:\n- Backend fitting API (fitItem, getFittedItems)\n- Console error detection\n- What it CANNOT test:\n  - Whether UI slot elements are visible\n  - Whether double-click events work on inventory items\n  - Whether the UI correctly triggers the backend APIs",
  "suggestedManualInvestigation": [
    "Check git history for changes to ShipFittingUI.js or related CSS files",
    "Inspect browser DevTools Elements panel to see if slot DOM elements exist but are hidden",
    "Add console.log in StationUI.js:1450 and :1605 to debug the double-click handler",
    "Check if ship data is properly initialized when StationUI opens"
  ]
}
```

DECISION: cannot_implement
