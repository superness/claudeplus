  "bugSummary": "Ship fitting system has two critical bugs: (1) Missing equipment slot UI elements (regression), (2) TypeError when double-clicking items to fit them",
  "expectedBehavior": "Ship fitting UI should display visible equipment slots where items can be dragged. Double-clicking an item should automatically fit it to an appropriate slot without errors.",
  "actualBehavior": "Equipment slots are not rendered/visible in the ship fitting UI. Double-clicking items throws 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' error at StationUI.js:1605 in autoFitItem function, and fitting fails.",
  "affectedSystems": ["UI", "ship-fitting", "inventory", "station-interface"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser and dock at a station",
    "Step 2: Open the ship fitting interface from the station menu",
    "Step 3: Observe that equipment slots (high/mid/low slots) are not visible in the UI",
    "Step 4: Attempt to double-click any fittable item in inventory",
    "Step 5: Check browser console - observe TypeError at StationUI.js:1605",
    "Step 6: Verify that item was not fitted to ship"

  "hypothesis": "Two separate issues: (1) UI regression - CSS display property changed, HTML template broken, or component initialization failing for equipment slots, (2) Runtime error - autoFitItem function tries to access ship.hull property but ship object is undefined/null, suggesting broken reference to current ship data or missing initialization check. The QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715 error may be related to ship data retrieval failure."
