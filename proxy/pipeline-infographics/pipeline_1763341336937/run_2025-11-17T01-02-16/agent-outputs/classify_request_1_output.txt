  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'DEBUG AND FIX' and describes a broken core functionality - the ship is 'completely non-functional for movement' and 'does not move at all' despite navigation commands. This is a critical bug affecting core gameplay. The request includes systematic debugging steps and requires investigation to identify root cause before fixing.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "DEBUG AND FIX: The player ship is completely non-functional for movement. Even after setting navigation targets and tapping locations in space to fly to, the ship does not move at all. Investigate the movement system to identify why the ship isn't responding to navigation commands. Check: 1) Navigation target setting logic, 2) Movement/physics update code, 3) Input handling for tap-to-move, 4) Any conditions that might prevent movement (flags, state checks, etc.), 5) Integration between navigation system and ship physics. Once the root cause is identified, implement a fix and verify the ship can now move to navigation targets.",
