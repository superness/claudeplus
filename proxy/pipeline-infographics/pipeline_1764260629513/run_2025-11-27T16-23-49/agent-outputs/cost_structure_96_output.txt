I can see the cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review the existing content against the requirements and what was requested. The document is already complete with all required sections:

1. ✓ Cost Structure Overview (fixed vs. variable, philosophy, key drivers)
2. ✓ Operating Expenses by Category (Personnel, Infrastructure, Marketing & Sales, G&A)
3. ✓ Cost Projections (5 Years) with detailed table
4. ✓ Burn Rate Analysis (monthly burn, runway calculations, milestones)
5. ✓ Breakeven Analysis (breakeven point, timeline, path to profitability)
6. ✓ Cost Optimization Opportunities (efficiency, scale economics, automation)

The document is well-structured, aligned with the revenue model, and contains thorough analysis. It appears the cost structure analysis is already complete and comprehensive.

The existing document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` already contains:

**Cost Structure Overview:**
- Fixed/Variable: 45-55% each at scale
- Philosophy: Product-first, community leverage, automation priority, lean operations, capital efficiency
- Key drivers: Snapshot storage/bandwidth, engineering talent, customer acquisition

**5-Year Cost Projections:**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $390K | $667K | $904K | $1,325K |
| Infrastructure | $26.5K | $63.5K | $131K | $210K | $306K |
| Marketing | $23K | $65K | $195K | $320K | $517K |
| G&A | $42K | $95K | $171K | $254K | $354K |
| **Total** | **$219K** | **$614K** | **$1,164K** | **$1,688K** | **$2,502K** |

**Key Metrics:**
- Breakeven: Month 26-28 (~5,833 customers, $1.19M ARR)
- Peak cumulative burn: ~$260K
- Recommended funding: $250K-400K Pre-Seed/Seed
- Operating margin at Year 5: 39%
- LTV:CAC: 14-18x (exceptionally strong)

**Personnel Plan:**
- Year 1: 1 FTE (founder only)
- Year 2: 3 FTEs (+senior backend, part-time DevOps/DevRel)
- Year 3: 5.5 FTEs (+full DevOps, frontend, customer success)
- Year 5: 11 FTEs (full team)

The cost structure is well-aligned with the revenue model ($4.1M ARR by Year 5) and supports the thesis target of $50K+ MRR potential.
