The revenue model document already exists and is comprehensive. Looking at it, it's actually quite complete with:

- Executive Summary
- Revenue Model Overview with 4 revenue streams
- Detailed Pricing Strategy with tiers ($0, $10/mo, $25/mo, Custom)
- Unit Economics (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, Payback, Gross Margin)
- 5-Year Revenue Projections table
- Revenue Growth Assumptions
- Sensitivity Analysis (Best, Base, Conservative cases)
- Appendices for persona-based revenue and altcoin profitability

The document appears to be complete and well-structured, meeting all the requirements for a revenue model document. It includes:

1. **Revenue Model Overview** - 4 streams with mix projections
2. **Pricing Strategy** - Philosophy, tiers, price point analysis, psychology, promotions
3. **Unit Economics** - CAC ($15-25), LTV ($280-400), LTV:CAC (>13x), payback (~1.5 months), gross margin (80-86%)
4. **Revenue Projections** - 5-year table with customers, ARPU, MRR, ARR, growth rate
5. **Growth Assumptions** - Customer acquisition, churn, expansion, market penetration
6. **Sensitivity Analysis** - Best ($8.4M ARR Y5), Base ($4.1M ARR Y5), Conservative ($1.5M ARR Y5)

The existing document is thorough and aligned with the thesis and market analysis. It appears a previous stage has already completed this work.
