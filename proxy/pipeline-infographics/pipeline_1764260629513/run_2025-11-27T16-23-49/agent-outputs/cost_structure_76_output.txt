The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it to ensure it aligns with the revenue model and thesis:

The existing cost structure document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is already complete and well-aligned with:

1. **The thesis refinement** - Remote-first, lean team structure matching hobbyist market positioning
2. **The revenue model** - OpEx projections correctly reference the $201.6K → $4.1M ARR trajectory
3. **Unit economics** - CAC ($15-25), LTV:CAC (14-18:1), and gross margins (81-86%) are consistent

**Key Cost Structure Highlights:**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $667K | $1.33M |
| Infrastructure | $27K | $131K | $306K |
| Marketing & Sales | $23K | $195K | $517K |
| G&A | $42K | $171K | $354K |
| **Total OpEx** | **$219K** | **$1.16M** | **$2.50M** |

**Financial Position:**
- Year 1: Near-breakeven (-$17K operating loss)
- Year 2: First operating profit ($58K)
- Year 3: Strong margins (24% operating margin)
- Year 5: Excellent margins (39% operating margin, $1.6M profit)

**Burn Rate & Funding:**
- Peak cumulative burn: ~$260K (Year 3 Q1)
- Breakeven: Month 26-28
- Recommended funding: $250K-400K Pre-Seed/Seed

**Key Strengths:**
- Low CAC ($15-25) driven by community-first marketing
- Sub-2-month payback period (exceptional)
- Infrastructure per-customer cost drops from $8 to $2.60 with scale
- Lean headcount: 1 FTE (Year 1) → 11 FTE (Year 5)

The document is complete and ready. No updates are needed.
