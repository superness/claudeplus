The file already exists with a comprehensive revenue model. Let me review it against the requirements and the market analysis to see if it needs updates or if it's already complete. The existing file is quite thorough, but I should verify it aligns with the latest market analysis inputs and includes all the required sections from the output format.

Looking at the existing file:
- ✓ Revenue Model Overview - present
- ✓ Pricing Strategy - present
- ✓ Unit Economics - present
- ✓ Revenue Projections - present
- ✓ Revenue Growth Assumptions - present
- ✓ Sensitivity Analysis - present

The existing revenue model is already comprehensive and well-structured. It aligns with the thesis (open-core SaaS with snapshot subscriptions), the market analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM figures), the customer personas (pricing aligned with Sarah, Marcus, Viktor, Alex, Wei), and the competitive analysis (pricing compared to Umbrel, MyNode, Start9).

The document is complete and meets all the requirements. Let me provide my decision.

The revenue model document at `business-plan/financial/01-revenue-model.md` is already comprehensive and complete. It includes:

**Revenue Model Overview**
- Primary revenue streams: Snapshot subscriptions (70%), support (15%), hardware (10%), enterprise (5%)
- Open-core SaaS model with infrastructure services
- Revenue mix projections across 5 years

**Pricing Strategy**
- 4 tiers: Community (Free), Starter ($10/mo), Pro ($25/mo), Enterprise (custom)
- Price point analysis vs competitors and value delivered
- Promotional pricing including launch specials, annual discounts, referral programs

**Unit Economics**
- CAC estimates: $75 Y1 → $40 Y5 (blended)
- LTV projections: $350-$550 range
- LTV:CAC ratio: 4.7:1 Y1 → 13.8:1 Y5
- Payback period: <6 months target
- Gross margin: 75-80%

**Revenue Projections (5 Years)**
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Paying Customers | 455 | 1,215 | 2,235 | 3,255 | 4,180 |
| ARR | $115K | $299K | $607K | $947K | $1.25M |
| Blended ARPU | $21 | $21 | $23 | $24 | $25 |

**Sensitivity Analysis**
- Best case: $2.4M ARR by Year 5
- Base case: $1.25M ARR by Year 5
- Conservative case: $660K ARR by Year 5
- Key variables: Conversion rate, churn rate, market size

The model is well-aligned with the thesis (open-core + snapshot services), market analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM figures), and customer personas (pricing matches willingness-to-pay research).
