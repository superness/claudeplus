I have created a comprehensive revenue model document for MineBox. Here's a summary of what was developed:

## Revenue Model Summary

**Model Type**: Open-Core SaaS with Infrastructure Services

**Pricing Tiers**:
- Free: $0 (full software, self-hosted)
- Starter: $10/month (1 coin snapshot sync)
- Pro: $25/month (5 coins, priority support, API)
- Enterprise: Custom ($100-500/month)

**Key Projections (Base Case)**:

| Year | Customers | MRR | ARR |
|------|-----------|-----|-----|
| 1 | 1,200 | $16,800 | $201,600 |
| 2 | 3,500 | $56,000 | $672,000 |
| 3 | 7,500 | $127,500 | $1,530,000 |
| 4 | 12,000 | $216,000 | $2,592,000 |
| 5 | 18,000 | $342,000 | $4,104,000 |

**Unit Economics**:
- Gross Margin: 81%+
- LTV:CAC Ratio: 14-19x
- Payback Period: <2 months
- Blended LTV: $347

**$50K MRR Target**: Achieved at Month 20 (base case)

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
- Best case: $8.4M ARR by Year 5
- Base case: $4.1M ARR by Year 5
- Conservative: $1.5M ARR by Year 5

The model validates the thesis that open-source software with paid snapshot infrastructure can achieve sustainable $50K+ MRR while maintaining community trust.
