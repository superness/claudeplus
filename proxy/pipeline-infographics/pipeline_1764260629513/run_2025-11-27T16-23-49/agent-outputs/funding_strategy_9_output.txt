I have created a comprehensive funding strategy for MineBox. Here's a summary of the key elements:

## Funding Strategy Summary

**Total Capital Required**: $800K-1M to profitability
**Recommended Initial Raise**: $500-750K (Seed round)
**Runway Requirement**: 24-30 months
**Expected Breakeven**: Month 36-48

### Use of Funds (for $750K raise):
| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $300K | 40% |
| Sales & Marketing | $150K | 20% |
| Infrastructure | $100K | 13% |
| Operations | $75K | 10% |
| Working Capital | $75K | 10% |
| Founder Salary | $50K | 7% |

### Funding Timeline:
- **Pre-Seed ($50-100K)**: Month 0 - MVP development
- **Seed ($400-600K)**: Month 6-9 - Team and growth
- **Bridge ($200-300K, if needed)**: Month 24-30 - Path to profitability
- **Series A (optional, $2-3M)**: Month 36-48 - Market expansion

### Cap Table Projections (Post-Seed):
- Founders: 75%
- Pre-Seed: 2.5%
- Seed Investors: 17.5%
- Option Pool: 5%

### Investor Return Projections:
| Scenario | Multiple | IRR |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Conservative | 0.9x | -3% |
| Base Case | 2.1x | 16% |
| Upside | 5.3x | 39% |
| Bull Case | 8.8x | 54% |

The strategy emphasizes a hybrid bootstrap/raise approach, targeting crypto-native angels and specialized funds who understand the open-core model and can add value through network connections to the Bitaxe/hobbyist mining community.
