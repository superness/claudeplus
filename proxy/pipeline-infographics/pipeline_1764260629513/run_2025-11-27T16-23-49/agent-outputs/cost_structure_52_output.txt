I've reviewed all the relevant documents. The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me verify if there are any gaps or if it needs updates based on the revenue model and thesis:

The existing cost structure document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is already comprehensive and well-aligned with:

1. **Thesis alignment** - Matches the $50K+ MRR target, open-core model, and Raspberry Pi 5 deployment focus
2. **Revenue model alignment** - Cost projections are properly tied to the revenue model's $139K Year 1 → $3.1M Year 5 ARR projections
3. **Market analysis alignment** - CAC assumptions reflect the community-driven acquisition strategy for Bitaxe owners

The existing document includes:
- **Cost Structure Overview** - 45-55% fixed/variable split, lean operations philosophy
- **Operating Expenses by Category** - Personnel (1→11 FTEs), Infrastructure ($26K→$306K), Marketing & Sales ($23K→$517K), G&A ($40K→$319K)
- **5-Year Cost Projections** - Total OpEx from $216K (Year 1) to $2.47M (Year 5)
- **Burn Rate Analysis** - Monthly burn projections, cumulative losses peaking at ~$750K
- **Runway Calculations** - $500K-750K seed funding recommendation
- **Breakeven Analysis** - Month 40-42 breakeven, 6,786 customers needed
- **Cost Optimization Opportunities** - Scale economics, automation opportunities

The document is complete, thorough, and properly cross-referenced with the revenue model. No updates are needed.
