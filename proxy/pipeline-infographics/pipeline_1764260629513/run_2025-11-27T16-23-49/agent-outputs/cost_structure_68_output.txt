The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me verify it aligns with the revenue model and thesis, and contains all the required sections from the task.

The existing cost structure document at `business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is complete and comprehensive. It includes all required sections:

**Burn Rate Analysis:**
- Monthly burn: $15K (Y1 Q1) → $145K (Y4 Q4)
- Cumulative losses peak at ~$750K in Year 3-4
- Recommended initial capital: $500K-750K for 28-42 months runway

**Breakeven Analysis:**
- Breakeven point: ~6,786 customers / $142,500 MRR / ~$1.71M ARR
- Breakeven timeline: Month 40-42 (Year 4 Q2)
