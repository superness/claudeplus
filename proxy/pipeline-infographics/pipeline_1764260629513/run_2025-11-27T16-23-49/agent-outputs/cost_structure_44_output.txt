I can see that a comprehensive cost structure document already exists at `business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md`. The document is complete and includes:

1. **Cost Structure Overview** - Fixed vs. variable breakdown, cost philosophy, key drivers
2. **Operating Expenses by Category** - Personnel, infrastructure, marketing & sales, G&A
3. **5-Year Cost Projections** - Detailed tables with all categories
4. **Burn Rate Analysis** - Monthly projections, runway calculations, milestones vs. cash
5. **Breakeven Analysis** - Customer/unit calculations, timeline, path to profitability
6. **Cost Optimization Opportunities** - Efficiency improvements, scale economics, automation

The document is well-aligned with the revenue model ($3.72M ARR Year 5) and shows:
- Year 1: $218K OpEx, $180K Revenue = -$38K loss
- Year 3: $1.15M OpEx, $1.26M Revenue = $105K profit (breakeven achieved)
- Year 5: $2.49M OpEx, $3.72M Revenue = $1.23M profit (33% operating margin)

The cost structure analysis is already complete and comprehensive. The document covers all required sections with detailed financial projections aligned to the revenue model.

**Key findings from the existing analysis:**
- **Personnel costs** dominate early years (70-77% Y1-Y2), declining to 36% by Y5
- **Infrastructure costs** scale efficiently ($8/customer → $2.60/customer)
- **Breakeven** projected at Month 30-33 (~$90K MRR, 2,826 customers)
- **Recommended funding**: $250-300K for 24-30 month runway to breakeven
- **Operating margin**: Grows from -21% (Y1) to +33% (Y5)
