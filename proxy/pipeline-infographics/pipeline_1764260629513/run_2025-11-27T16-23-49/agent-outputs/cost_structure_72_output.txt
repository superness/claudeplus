### Key Financial Metrics

### Funding Implications

**Recommended**: $250K-400K Pre-Seed/Seed Round
- Provides 26-42 months runway
- Reaches monthly breakeven with buffer
- Lower capital requirement than typical SaaS due to strong unit economics

### Cost Structure Strengths

1. **Lean personnel model**: 1 FTE in Year 1, scaling to 11 by Year 5
2. **Efficient infrastructure**: Per-customer costs decrease from $22 to $17 at scale
3. **Community-driven marketing**: Low CAC through organic/word-of-mouth channels
4. **Remote-first operations**: Minimal G&A overhead
