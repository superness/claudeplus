The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. After reviewing it against the requirements and comparing it to the thesis, revenue model, and cost structure documents, I can see it covers all the required sections:

1. **Funding Requirements** - Total capital, milestones, tranches, runway
2. **Use of Funds** - Detailed allocation table with categories
3. **Funding Strategy** - Bootstrap vs. raise, RBF, equity vs. debt, preferred sources
4. **Investment Thesis** - Why investors should fund, highlights, risk mitigation, returns
5. **Funding Timeline** - Round progression with milestones
6. **Investor Targeting** - Ideal profile, target types, strategic vs. financial, value-add
7. **Cap Table Projections** - Current, post-seed, dilution, option pool
8. **Exit Considerations** - Paths, comparables, timeline, return projections

The document is well-aligned with the revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5) and cost structure ($2.5M OpEx Year 5). The funding strategy is appropriate for a capital-efficient SaaS business targeting the hobbyist cryptocurrency mining market.

The funding strategy document at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` is complete with:

**Key Funding Highlights:**
- **Recommended raise**: $300-400K (target $350K) via SAFE notes
- **Valuation**: $1.4-1.75M pre-money
- **Runway**: 30+ months to reach monthly breakeven (Month 26-28)
- **Investor mix**: 70% financial / 30% strategic angels (crypto-native preferred)

**Use of Funds:**
| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $150K | 43% |
| Sales & Marketing | $60K | 17% |
| Operations | $45K | 13% |
| Working Capital | $60K | 17% |
| G&A | $35K | 10% |

**Expected Returns (Base Case):**
- Year 5 ARR: $4.1M
- Exit multiple: 5x ARR = $20.5M EV
- Investor return: 11.7x MOIC / 55% IRR

**Exit Paths:**
- Strategic acquisition (50% probability): $15-30M
- PE/Aggregator (25%): $12-20M  
- Profitable lifestyle business (20%): Distributions
- IPO (5%): Unlikely for niche market

The strategy emphasizes capital efficiency with a single round to profitability—rare in SaaS—enabled by exceptional unit economics (14-18x LTV:CAC).
