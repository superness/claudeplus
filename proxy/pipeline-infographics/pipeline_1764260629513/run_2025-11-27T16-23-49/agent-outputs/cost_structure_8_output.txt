I've created a comprehensive cost structure analysis for MineBox. Here's a summary of the key findings:

## Cost Structure Summary

**Total Operating Expenses (5-Year Projection):**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $390K | $665K | $900K | $1,310K |
| Infrastructure | $27K | $64K | $131K | $210K | $306K |
| Marketing & Sales | $22K | $58K | $177K | $285K | $597K |
| G&A | $40K | $84K | $142K | $201K | $261K |
| **Total** | **$215K** | **$595K** | **$1,115K** | **$1,596K** | **$2,474K** |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Headcount**: Grows from 1 FTE (founder) to 11 FTEs by Year 5, senior-heavy
2. **Infrastructure Cost Efficiency**: Per-customer costs drop from ~$8/month to ~$3.30/month at scale
3. **Breakeven Point**: ~5,000 paying customers / $110K MRR / $1.32M ARR
4. **Breakeven Timeline**: Month 48-54 (growth-focused) or Month 36 (capital-efficient)
5. **Recommended Initial Capital**: $400K-500K for 16-20 month runway
6. **Total Cumulative Investment to Breakeven**: ~$800K-1M

**Cost Optimization Levers:**
- CDN/P2P hybrid for bandwidth savings (15-25%)
- Community-driven support to reduce labor costs (40-50%)
- Automation of onboarding and billing
- Scale economics on shared snapshot storage
