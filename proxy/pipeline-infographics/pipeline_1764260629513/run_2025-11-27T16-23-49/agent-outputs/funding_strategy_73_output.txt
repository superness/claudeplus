I have created a comprehensive funding strategy document for MineBox. Here's a summary of what was developed:

## Funding Strategy Summary

**Recommended Raise: $350,000 (Pre-Seed/Seed)**

### Funding Requirements
- **Minimum Viable**: $250K (tight buffer)
- **Recommended**: $350K (comfortable runway)
- **Maximum**: $500K (accelerated growth)

### Use of Funds

| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $140K | 40% |
| Engineering Talent | $87.5K | 25% |
| Sales & Marketing | $52.5K | 15% |
| Infrastructure | $35K | 10% |
| Working Capital | $35K | 10% |

### Key Terms
- **Valuation**: $1.4M post-money SAFE
- **Dilution**: 20-25% at Seed
- **Founder Ownership Post-Seed**: 72.7%
- **Breakeven**: Month 26-28
- **Path to $50K MRR**: Month 20

### Expected Investor Returns (Base Case)

| Exit Valuation | Return | Multiple |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| $20M (conservative) | $4.4M | 12.6x |
| $25M (base) | $5.5M | 15.7x |
| $33M (upside) | $7.3M | 20.9x |

### Funding Timeline
1. **Seed** ($350K): Month 0 - MVP to $10K MRR
2. **Bridge** ($150K, optional): Month 18 - Growth acceleration
3. **Series A** ($2-3M): Month 36 - Scale to $150K+ MRR

The strategy is fully aligned with the revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5) and cost structure (breakeven Month 26-28), emphasizing MineBox's exceptional capital efficiency (14-18x LTV:CAC) as a key investment thesis.
