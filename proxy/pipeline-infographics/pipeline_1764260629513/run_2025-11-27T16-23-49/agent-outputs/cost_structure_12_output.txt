I can see there's already a comprehensive cost structure document in place at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md`. This document is already complete and well-structured, containing all the required sections:

1. **Cost Structure Overview** - Fixed vs. variable breakdown (45-55% each), cost allocation philosophy, key cost drivers
2. **Personnel Costs** - Complete headcount plan (1→11 FTEs over 5 years), salary ranges ($60K-180K base), contractor costs ($47K-$100K/year)
3. **Infrastructure Costs** - Cloud/hosting ($22.8K→$262.8K), third-party services, tools, scaling curves showing per-customer cost decreasing from $8 to $3.30
4. **Marketing & Sales Costs** - CAC targets ($75→$40), budget allocation, sales team timeline
5. **G&A Costs** - Remote-first facilities, legal/accounting, insurance, other overhead
6. **5-Year Projections** - Complete table from $215K (Y1) to $2.47M (Y5) total operating expenses
7. **Burn Rate Analysis** - Monthly projections, runway calculations ($400-500K recommended capital)
8. **Breakeven Analysis** - 5,000 customers at $110K MRR, Month 36-54 timeline depending on growth strategy
9. **Cost Optimization Opportunities** - Storage (20-30% savings), CDN (15-25%), automation priorities

The document aligns well with:
- The revenue model's projections ($115K→$1.25M ARR)
- The thesis's $50K+ MRR potential target
- The market analysis SOM of $600K-1.2M annually
- The open-core SaaS model with infrastructure-heavy value delivery

**Key Cost Structure Insights:**

**Critical Metrics:**
- Gross Margin: 72% → 82% (improving with scale)
- CAC Payback: 4.5 months
- LTV:CAC: 5:1 → 14:1
- Breakeven: Month 36-54 depending on growth investment

The cost structure document is complete and ready for the funding strategy phase.
