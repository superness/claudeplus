I've created a comprehensive funding strategy document for MineBox. Here's a summary of what's included:

## Funding Strategy Complete

The document at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` covers:

### Key Funding Parameters
- **Total Capital Required**: $250K-300K to reach breakeven (Month 30-33)
- **Recommended Structure**: Post-Money SAFE with $2M cap
- **Founder Ownership Post-Raise**: 70% (maintains control)
- **Expected Investor Returns**: 10-20x base case, ~17x probability-weighted

### Use of Funds Breakdown
| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $127K | 42% |
| Infrastructure | $53K | 18% |
| Sales & Marketing | $45K | 15% |
| Operations/G&A | $35K | 12% |
| Working Capital | $40K | 13% |

### Funding Strategy
- **Primary**: Angel investors (crypto-native preferred)
- **Bootstrap vs. Raise**: Recommends raising due to competitive window
- **RBF**: Considered for Year 2 growth acceleration (post-PMF)

### Investment Thesis Highlights
- Underserved $12-15M TAM with Bitaxe-driven demand
- Multi-coin SHA256 differentiation + snapshot sync value
- Open-core model follows GitLab/Bitwarden/HashiCorp pattern
- Capital-efficient path: breakeven at Month 30-33

### Exit Considerations
- Most likely: Strategic acquisition by node software or hardware company (55%)
- Timeline: Year 4-6 optimal
- Base case exit: $15M at 4x ARR
- Comparable multiples: 3-8x ARR for similar companies

The strategy aligns with the revenue model ($3.72M ARR Year 5) and cost structure ($2.49M OpEx Year 5, 33% operating margin) from previous stages.
