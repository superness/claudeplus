**Key Cost Structure Highlights:**

| Year | Personnel | Infrastructure | Marketing & Sales | G&A | Total OpEx |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-----|------------|
| 1 | $127K | $26.5K | $22K | $39.7K | $215K |

| 5 | $1.31M | $305.6K | $597K | $260.9K | $2.47M |

**Critical Metrics:**
- **Breakeven**: Month 48-54 (growth-focused) or Month 36 (capital-efficient)
- **Required Funding**: $400-500K for comfortable runway to $50K MRR
- **Gross Margin**: 72% → 82% with scale
- **Per-Customer Infrastructure**: $8/mo → $3.30/mo at 5,000 customers
- **LTV:CAC**: 5:1 → 14:1 improvement

The cost structure follows a lean, personnel-heavy model appropriate for a product-focused open-source company, with infrastructure costs scaling efficiently due to shared snapshot storage and CDN volume discounts.
