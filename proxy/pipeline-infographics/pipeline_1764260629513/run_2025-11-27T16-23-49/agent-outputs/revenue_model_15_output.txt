The revenue model document already exists and is comprehensive. Looking at what's there, it covers all the required sections:

- Revenue Model Overview (with primary revenue streams, model type, and revenue mix projections)
- Pricing Strategy (with philosophy, tiers/packages, price point analysis, psychology, and promotions)
- Unit Economics (with CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratios, payback period, gross margin, contribution margin)
- Revenue Projections (5-year table with customers, ARPU, MRR, ARR, growth rates)
- Revenue Growth Assumptions (customer acquisition, churn, expansion, market penetration)
- Sensitivity Analysis (best case, base case, conservative case, key variables)

The document is complete and well-structured. Let me verify it meets all the requirements from the task:

**Reviewing the existing document against requirements:**

| Required Section | Present | Notes |
|------------------|---------|-------|
| Revenue Model Overview | Yes | Primary streams, model type, revenue mix |
| Pricing Strategy | Yes | Philosophy, tiers, price analysis, psychology, promotions |
| Unit Economics | Yes | CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, payback, gross margin, contribution margin |
| Revenue Projections (5 Years) | Yes | Full table with all metrics |
| Revenue Growth Assumptions | Yes | Acquisition, churn, expansion, penetration |
| Sensitivity Analysis | Yes | All three scenarios + key variables |

The revenue model is complete and comprehensive. It aligns with:
- The thesis document (open-core SaaS, snapshot sync value, multi-coin differentiation, Pi-native)
- The market analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM figures, persona-based pricing)
- The competitive analysis (pricing vs. Umbrel, MyNode, Start9, pool fees)

The model projects realistic growth from $115K ARR in Year 1 to $1.25M ARR in Year 5, with healthy unit economics (LTV:CAC > 5:1) and reasonable churn assumptions.
