## Funding Strategy Complete

I've created a comprehensive funding strategy for MineBox at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md`. Key highlights:

**Funding Requirements**
- **Total Capital**: $500K-600K (recommended) for 18-20 months runway
- **Path to Breakeven**: Month 36 (capital-efficient) to Month 48-54 (growth-focused)
- **Structure**: Founder pre-seed ($100K) + Strategic Angel Seed ($400K)

**Use of Funds**
| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $225K | 45% |
| Sales & Marketing | $100K | 20% |
| Operations | $100K | 20% |
| Working Capital | $75K | 15% |

**Investment Thesis**
- Underserved $10M+ hobbyist mining market (Bitaxe proves demand)
- Strong unit economics: LTV:CAC 5:1+, 78% gross margin, <6 month payback
- Open-source model builds community trust while enabling sustainable revenue
- First-mover in snapshot-native, multi-coin mining infrastructure

**Cap Table Projections**
- Post-Seed: Founder 72.7%, Investors 18.2%, Option Pool 9.1%
- $2M pre-money valuation at seed
- Dilution management through revenue-based financing at $25K+ MRR

**Exit Considerations**
- Primary path: Strategic acquisition (60% probability) at 4-6x ARR
- Target acquirers: Braiins, Foundry, Blockstream, Casa, Umbrel
- Optimal window: Year 4-6 ($800K-1.5M ARR)
- Base case investor returns: 2.5x / 20% IRR over 5 years

The funding strategy aligns with the revenue model ($1.25M ARR Year 5) and cost structure ($500K breakeven capital) to present a capital-efficient opportunity for crypto-native angel investors.
