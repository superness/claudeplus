The revenue model document already exists and is comprehensive. It includes:

- **Revenue Model Overview** - Open-core SaaS with 4 revenue streams (subscriptions, hardware bundles, premium support, enterprise)
- **Pricing Strategy** - 4 tiers (Free, Starter $10/mo, Pro $25/mo, Enterprise $100+)
- **Unit Economics** - CAC of $12.50-$22, LTV of $187-$12,000 by tier, LTV:CAC ratios of 18-25:1
- **5-Year Projections** - From $139K ARR (Year 1) to $3.1M ARR (Year 5)
- **Revenue Growth Assumptions** - Customer acquisition, churn, expansion, and market penetration assumptions
- **Sensitivity Analysis** - Best case ($5.4M ARR Year 5), Base case ($3.1M ARR), Conservative ($1.45M ARR)

The existing document is thorough and well-aligned with the thesis and market analysis. It properly addresses:

1. The $50K+ MRR target from the thesis
2. Persona-specific pricing considerations (Viktor's self-host option, Wei's PPP pricing)
3. Open-core model matching the thesis recommendation
4. Realistic projections based on the 10,000-25,000 Bitaxe owner TAM

The revenue model is complete and ready for the next phase.
