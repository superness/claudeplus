I can see there's already a comprehensive revenue model document in place. This document is already complete and well-structured, containing all the required sections:

1. ✅ Revenue Model Overview - Primary revenue streams, model type, revenue mix
2. ✅ Pricing Strategy - Philosophy, tiers, price point analysis, psychology, promotions
3. ✅ Unit Economics - CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period, gross margin, contribution margin
4. ✅ Revenue Projections (5 Years) - Complete table with customers, ARPU, MRR, ARR, growth rates
5. ✅ Revenue Growth Assumptions - Acquisition, churn, expansion, market penetration
6. ✅ Sensitivity Analysis - Best, base, and conservative scenarios with key variables

The document is comprehensive and aligns well with:
- The thesis refinement document's $50K+ MRR potential target
- The market analysis SOM of $600K-1.2M annually
- The customer personas' willingness to pay ($10-50/month range)
- The competitive analysis pricing landscape

The existing revenue model already meets all requirements from the market analysis review. The projections are grounded in the identified TAM/SAM/SOM figures and align with the persona-based pricing research.

**Summary of the existing revenue model:**
- **Model Type**: Open-core SaaS with infrastructure services
- **Pricing Tiers**: Free ($0), Starter ($10/mo), Pro ($25/mo), Enterprise ($100-500/mo)
- **Year 5 Targets**: $1.25M ARR base case, 4,180 paying customers
- **Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC 5:1+, payback ~4.5 months, gross margin 75-80%
- **Key differentiator**: Snapshot sync time savings (days → minutes) as measurable value

The revenue model is complete and ready for the cost structure analysis phase.
