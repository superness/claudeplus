The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it to ensure it covers all the required sections and is fully aligned with the revenue model and cost structure documents. The existing document appears complete with all required sections:

1. **Funding Requirements** - Total capital, milestones, tranches, runway
2. **Use of Funds** - Detailed table and breakdown
3. **Funding Strategy** - Preferred sources, bootstrap vs. raise, RBF, equity vs. debt
4. **Investment Thesis** - Why investors should fund, highlights, risk mitigation, expected returns
5. **Funding Timeline** - Round-by-round roadmap with timing and milestones
6. **Investor Targeting** - Ideal profile, target investors by type, strategic vs. financial, value-add
7. **Cap Table Projections** - Current, post-seed, dilution projections, ESOP
8. **Exit Considerations** - Potential paths, comparable exits, timeline, return projections

The document is well-structured and aligned with:
- Revenue Model: $4.1M ARR Year 5, $50K MRR by Month 20, 81%+ gross margins, 14-18x LTV:CAC
- Cost Structure: $350K seed recommendation, breakeven Month 26-28, 39% operating margin Year 5

The funding strategy document is already complete and comprehensive. It includes all required sections with detailed financial projections, investor targeting strategies, cap table modeling, and exit analysis.

**Key highlights from the existing document:**
- **Recommended raise**: $350K Pre-Seed/Seed round
- **Valuation**: $1.4M post-money 
- **Founder ownership post-seed**: 72.7%
- **Path to profitability**: Month 26-28
- **Expected investor returns**: 10-16x MOIC, 50-85% IRR
- **Primary investors**: Bitcoin-aligned angels, crypto pre-seed funds
- **Exit paths**: Strategic acquisition ($15-50M), PE roll-up ($20-40M)

The document is fully aligned with the revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5) and cost structure (breakeven Month 26-28, $2.5M OpEx Year 5).
