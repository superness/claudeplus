I can see there's already a comprehensive funding strategy document in place. Let me review it against the requirements and see if it needs any updates based on the revenue model and cost structure inputs. The existing document is well-structured and covers all required sections. Let me verify it aligns with the latest data from the revenue model and cost structure documents.

The existing funding strategy document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` is already comprehensive and well-structured, containing all the required sections:

1. **Funding Requirements** - Total capital required ($800K-1M), funding milestones and tranches, runway requirements
2. **Use of Funds** - Complete breakdown table with Product Development (40%), Sales & Marketing (20%), Infrastructure (13%), Operations (10%), Working Capital (10%), Founder Salary (7%)
3. **Funding Strategy** - Bootstrap vs. raise analysis, preferred funding sources, revenue-based financing considerations, equity vs. debt considerations
4. **Investment Thesis** - Why investors should fund, key investment highlights, risk mitigation strategies, expected returns analysis
5. **Funding Timeline** - Detailed round progression table with amounts, timing, use, and milestones
6. **Investor Targeting** - Ideal investor profile, target investors by type, strategic vs. financial investors, value-add requirements
7. **Cap Table Projections** - Ownership by round, detailed post-seed cap table, employee option pool strategy, dilution projections
8. **Exit Considerations** - Potential exit paths, comparable exits, timeline considerations, return projections for investors

**Key Alignment with Revenue Model and Cost Structure:**

| Metric | Funding Strategy | Revenue Model | Cost Structure | Status |
|--------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Year 5 ARR | $1.25M (base) | $1.25M | — | ✅ Aligned |
| Total Capital Needed | $800K-1M | — | $400K-500K recommended | ✅ Conservative buffer |
| LTV:CAC | 5:1+ | 5:1 → 14:1 | — | ✅ Aligned |
| Gross Margin | 78% | 75-80% | 72% → 82% | ✅ Aligned |
| Payback Period | <6 months | 4.5 months | 4.5 months | ✅ Aligned |
| Breakeven Timeline | Month 36-48 | — | Month 36-54 | ✅ Aligned |
| Paying Customers (Y5) | — | 4,180 | 4,180 | ✅ Consistent |

The funding strategy document is comprehensive and aligns with the established revenue projections and cost structure. The recommended $500K-750K seed raise provides adequate runway to reach the $25-50K MRR milestones before needing additional capital.

**Summary of the Funding Strategy:**

- **Total Capital Required**: $800K-1M through profitability
- **Recommended Seed Round**: $500K at $3M pre-money valuation
- **Funding Path**: Pre-seed ($50-100K) → Seed ($400-600K) → Bridge if needed ($200-300K)
- **Investor Targets**: Crypto-native angels (primary), specialized funds (secondary), open-source focused funds (tertiary)
- **Exit Options**: Strategic acquisition (4-8x ARR), PE roll-up, or profitable operations
- **Expected Returns**: Base case 2.1x / 16% IRR, Upside 5.3x / 39% IRR

The document is complete and ready for the financial phase review.
