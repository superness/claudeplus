I've completed the thesis analysis. Here's a summary of what was extracted:

## Analysis Complete

The MineBox thesis document is well-structured and provides a comprehensive strategic framework. Key findings:

**Core Thesis**: MineBox targets hobbyist crypto miners with a multi-coin, snapshot-native infrastructure solution for Raspberry Pi 5, enabling solo mining on SHA256 altcoins with sub-$500 hardware.

**Business Model**: Open-source core + paid snapshot synchronization services (targeting $50K+ MRR), with hardware bundles as secondary revenue.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Multi-coin support (vs Bitcoin-only competitors)
- Snapshot sync reducing days to minutes
- Pi-first design matching hobbyist values
- Mining-focused (vs node-focused alternatives like Umbrel/Start9)

**Market Size**: $10M+ TAM through 2030, driven by Bitaxe adoption and home-lab culture.

**Critical Validations Needed**:
- Bitaxe sales data and growth trends
- SHA256 altcoin profitability calculations
- Pricing sensitivity research
- Snapshot adoption rates with verification

**Writing Guidance Captured**: Pain-first narrative, specific quantification (block times), transparency on trade-offs, persona-driven examples ("Sarah with her $200 Bitaxe").

The analysis document has been saved to `business-plan/00-thesis-analysis.md` with extracted concepts organized into business model, market, product/technology, operations, risks, evidence plan, writing guidance, and key questions sections.
