The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it against the requirements to see if any updates are needed based on the latest revenue model and cost structure data:

The existing document is well-structured and contains all the required sections:

1. **Funding Requirements** - Total capital, milestones, tranches, runway requirements
2. **Use of Funds** - Detailed allocation table with percentages
3. **Funding Strategy** - Sources, bootstrap vs. raise analysis, RBF, equity vs. debt
4. **Investment Thesis** - Why investors should fund, highlights, risk mitigation, returns
5. **Funding Timeline** - Round structure with amounts, timing, milestones
6. **Investor Targeting** - Ideal profile, target investors by type, strategic vs. financial
7. **Cap Table Projections** - Founder equity, post-seed, option pool, dilution
8. **Exit Considerations** - Exit paths, comparables, timeline, return projections

The document aligns well with the revenue model ($115K Y1 to $1.25M Y5 ARR) and cost structure ($215K Y1 to $2.47M Y5 OpEx). The funding strategy correctly identifies:
- $500K-600K capital requirement for 20-month runway
- $2M pre-money seed valuation with 16.7-18.2% dilution
- Strategic angel focus over institutional VC
- Path to breakeven by Month 36-42

The document is complete and comprehensive. I'll provide a summary to the user.
