The revenue model file already exists and is comprehensive. Looking at the content, it's a well-developed document that covers:

- Revenue Model Overview with primary streams and model type
- Pricing Strategy with tiers ($0 Free, $10 Starter, $25 Pro, Custom Enterprise)
- Unit Economics (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC, Payback Period, Gross Margin)
- 5-Year Revenue Projections
- Revenue Growth Assumptions
- Sensitivity Analysis (Best/Base/Conservative cases)

The existing document aligns well with the thesis refinement and market analysis. The projections are:
- Year 1 ARR: $201,600 (base case)
- Year 3 ARR: $1,530,000 (base case)
- Year 5 ARR: $4,104,000 (base case)

The model successfully addresses:
- Open-core SaaS approach with infrastructure services
- Pricing tiers matching persona willingness to pay
- Strong unit economics (LTV:CAC >13x)
- Path to $50K+ MRR thesis target by Month 20

The document is complete and ready. No updates are needed.
