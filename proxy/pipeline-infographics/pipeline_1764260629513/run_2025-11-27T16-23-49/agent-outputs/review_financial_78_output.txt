# MineBox Financial Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

The financial model is well-constructed, internally consistent, and demonstrates a compelling investment opportunity. The documents are comprehensive and investor-ready with some minor areas for improvement.

---

## 1. Accuracy & Consistency (35%) — Score: 9/10

### Numbers Verification

**Revenue Model Calculations:**
- Year 1 ARR: 1,200 customers × $14 ARPU × 12 = $201,600 ✓
- Year 3 ARR: 7,500 customers × $17 ARPU × 12 = $1,530,000 ✓
- Year 5 ARR: 18,000 customers × $19 ARPU × 12 = $4,104,000 ✓

**LTV Calculation Check (Blended):**
- LTV = ($15 × 81%) / 3.5% = $347 ✓ (correctly stated)

**Cost Structure Cross-Check:**
- Year 1: Personnel ($127K) + Infrastructure ($27K) + M&S ($23K) + G&A ($42K) = $219K ✓
- Year 5: $1,325K + $306K + $517K + $354K = $2,502K ≈ $2,502K (document says $2,501,940) ✓

**Operating Profit Verification:**
- Year 1: $201,600 - $218,700 = -$17,100 ✓
- Year 3: $1,530,000 - $1,164,350 = $365,650 ✓
- Year 5: $4,104,000 - $2,501,940 = $1,602,060 ✓

**Payment Processing Fees Check:**
- Year 3: $1,530,000 × 3.5% = $53,550 ✓
- Year 5: $4,104,000 × 3.5% = $143,640 ✓

### Cross-Document Alignment
All three documents reference consistent figures:
- ARR projections match across all documents ✓
- CAC/LTV metrics consistent ✓
- Breakeven timeline (Month 26-28) consistent ✓
- Funding ask ($350K) aligned with peak burn analysis ✓

## 2. Reasonableness (30%) — Score: 7.5/10

### Strengths

**Unit Economics (Excellent):**
| Metric | MineBox | SaaS Benchmark | Assessment |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------|
| LTV:CAC | 14-18x | 3-5x | Exceptionally strong |
| CAC Payback | 1.2-1.8 months | 12-18 months | Outstanding |
| Gross Margin | 80-86% | 70-80% | Above average |

**Growth Assumptions:**
- Year 1→2 growth (233%) is aggressive but reasonable for a new SaaS product
- Declining growth rates (233% → 128% → 69% → 58%) follow typical maturation curves

### Concerns

**1. CAC Projections May Be Optimistic**
- $15 blended CAC in Year 1 assumes 65% of customers come from organic/community (free or near-free)
- Community-driven acquisition at this scale requires established presence before launch
- **Risk**: If paid channels are needed earlier, CAC could double to $30+

**2. Churn Assumptions Are Aggressive**
- Year 1 monthly churn of 5% (46% annual) is realistic for early-stage
- Improving to 2.5% by Year 5 assumes strong product stickiness
- For a "sync infrastructure" product, users may churn after initial setup
- **Risk**: True churn could be 4-5% steady if product lacks ongoing engagement hooks

**3. Net Revenue Retention Trajectory**
- NRR improves from 59% (Year 1) to 94% (Year 5)
- Sub-100% NRR throughout the forecast indicates revenue leakage
- Expansion revenue assumptions (5% → 20%) require active upsell motions

**4. SOM Penetration Exceeding 100%**
- Year 5 shows 103% SOM penetration, which is acknowledged as "market larger than initially sized"
- This is hand-waved but signals TAM uncertainty

---

## 3. Completeness (20%) — Score: 9/10

### Documents Present
- ✓ Revenue Model (comprehensive)
- ✓ Cost Structure (detailed by category)
- ✓ Funding Strategy (complete with cap table)

### Key Metrics Included
- ✓ Unit economics (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC)
- ✓ 5-year projections
- ✓ Breakeven analysis
- ✓ Sensitivity analysis (Best/Base/Conservative)
- ✓ Cap table evolution
- ✓ Use of funds breakdown

### Areas Covered Well
- Scenario probability weighting with expected value calculation
- Multiple exit path analysis with comparables
- Detailed burn rate by quarter

---

## 4. Investor-Readiness (15%) — Score: 8.5/10

### Strengths

**Compelling Story:**
- Clear thesis: "Open-core + snapshot infrastructure in underserved hobbyist mining"
- Unique market position with Bitaxe tailwind
- Strong unit economics narrative

**Red Flags Addressed:**
- Crypto cyclicality risk acknowledged with multi-coin hedge
- Single founder risk addressed with early hire plan
- Snapshot trust concerns addressed (though could be stronger)

**Investor Value-Add Defined:**
- Specific investor profile (crypto-native angels, OSS-focused funds)
- Clear return expectations (10-25x MOIC)

### Weaknesses

**1. Revenue Concentration Risk Not Addressed**
- 70% of revenue from snapshot subscriptions by Year 3
- No discussion of platform risk (what if snapshots become commoditized?)

**2. Missing Cash Flow Statement**
- Only operating expenses shown; no full P&L or cash flow projection
- Working capital needs during growth not detailed

**3. Competitive Response Scenario Absent**
- "Competitive entry" listed as risk but no modeling of impact
- What happens if Umbrel adds mining features?

---

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Add CAC sensitivity table** showing impact if organic acquisition underperforms (e.g., CAC at $25, $35, $50)

2. **Include churn retention triggers** - what product features will drive churn from 5% to 2.5%? Current plan says "community features" but lacks specifics

3. **Address NRR below 100%** - explicitly acknowledge this is weak by SaaS standards and detail the path to 100%+ (specific expansion products needed)

4. **Add competitive scenario modeling** - what happens to Year 3 projections if a competitor launches with comparable features?

5. **Clarify Year 5 SOM overshoot** - the 103% penetration needs explanation beyond "market is larger" - either revise TAM or explain adjacent market capture

6. **Add monthly cash flow projection** for at least Year 1-2 (not just quarterly burn summary)

---

## Financial Red Flags

| Flag | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| CAC assumptions very optimistic | Medium | Model shows profitability even at 2x CAC, so downside is manageable |
| NRR <100% through Year 5 | Medium | Common for early-stage niche SaaS; trajectory is positive |
| SOM >100% by Year 5 | Low | Indicates TAM uncertainty, not fatal flaw |
| Single revenue stream dependency (70% snapshots) | Medium | Not addressed in documents |

---

## Verdict: **NEEDS_REVISION**

The financial model is solid and demonstrates strong fundamentals (exceptional unit economics, clear path to profitability, reasonable funding ask). However, several specific improvements are needed before it would pass rigorous investor due diligence:

1. CAC sensitivity analysis
2. Detailed churn improvement plan
3. NRR trajectory explanation
4. Competitive response scenario
5. Clearer TAM reconciliation

These are addressable revisions that would take 2-3 hours to complete. The core model does not need restructuring—it needs stress-testing documentation.
