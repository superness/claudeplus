I have updated the cost structure document with comprehensive analysis aligned with the revenue model. Here's a summary of the key findings:

## Cost Structure Summary

**5-Year Cost Projections:**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |

| **Total OpEx** | **$218K** | **$608K** | **$1.15M** | **$1.67M** | **$2.49M** |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Breakeven**: Month 30-33 (~Year 3 Q2-Q3) with ~$1M ARR and 2,826 customers
2. **Funding Required**: $250-300K provides 24-30 months runway to breakeven
3. **Profitability Path**: 33% operating margin by Year 5 ($1.2M profit on $3.72M ARR)
4. **Scale Economics**: Per-customer costs drop from $8/mo to $2.60/mo at 10,000 customers
5. **Personnel-Heavy Early**: 70-75% of costs in people during Years 1-2, declining to 35% by Year 5
6. **Lean Headcount**: 1 FTE Year 1 → 11 FTE Year 5 (senior-heavy, community-supplemented)

**Burn Rate Analysis:**
- Average net burn Year 1: ~$10K/month
- Peak burn Year 2 Q4: ~$8K/month
- Cash-flow positive: Year 3 Q2 onward

**Cost Optimization Opportunities:**
- Snapshot storage tiering: 20-30% savings potential
- CDN with P2P elements: 15-25% bandwidth reduction
- Community self-service support: 40-50% support labor savings
- Automation investments yield 3:1 ROI by Year 3
