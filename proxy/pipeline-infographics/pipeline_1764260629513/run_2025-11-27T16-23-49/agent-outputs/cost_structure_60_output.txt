The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me verify if it needs any updates based on the thesis and revenue model, and ensure it's complete.

The existing cost structure document at `/mnt/c/github/private-supercoinserv/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is already complete and well-aligned with:

1. **The MineBox thesis** - Addresses the open-source + paid infrastructure model with appropriate cost allocations
2. **The revenue model** - Cost projections tie directly to the revenue projections ($139K→$3.1M ARR over 5 years)
3. **All required sections** are present:
   - Cost Structure Overview (fixed vs. variable breakdown, philosophy, drivers)
   - Operating Expenses by Category (Personnel, Infrastructure, Marketing & Sales, G&A)
   - 5-Year Cost Projections with detailed tables
   - Burn Rate Analysis with quarterly projections
   - Breakeven Analysis (6,786 customers / $1.71M ARR breakeven point)
   - Cost Optimization Opportunities (scale economics, automation)

**Key highlights from the existing document:**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total OpEx | $216,540 | $1,145,800 | $2,466,900 |
| Operating Margin | -56% | -15% | 20% |
| Breakeven | — | — | Month 40-42 |
| Cumulative Cash Burn | $132K | $745K | Profitable |

**Funding Recommendation**: $500K-750K seed round for 28-42 months runway to reach breakeven.

The cost structure analysis is complete and ready for the funding strategy development phase.
