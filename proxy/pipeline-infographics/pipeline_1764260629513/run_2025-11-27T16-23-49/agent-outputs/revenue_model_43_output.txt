## Revenue Model Complete

I've reviewed and enhanced the revenue model document at `business-plan/financial/01-revenue-model.md`. The document includes:

### Revenue Model Overview
- **Primary revenue streams**: Snapshot Sync Subscriptions (65% at steady state), Premium Features (20%), Hardware Bundles (10%), Enterprise (5%)
- **Model type**: Open-Core SaaS with Infrastructure Services
- **Revenue mix projections** across 5 years showing subscriptions decreasing as % while enterprise grows

### Pricing Strategy
- **Four tiers**: Free ($0), Starter ($10/mo), Pro ($25/mo), Enterprise (custom $100-500+/mo)
- **Price point analysis** vs. competitors (Umbrel, MyNode, Start9, public pools)
- **Pricing psychology**: Anchor on time savings, $25 sweet spot, annual discounts
- **Promotions**: Launch specials, referral programs, PPP pricing for international users

### Unit Economics
- **CAC estimates**: $60 (Year 1) → $30 (Year 5) blended
- **LTV projections**: $144 (Starter) → $5,040+ (Enterprise)
- **LTV:CAC ratio**: 3.5:1 (Year 1) → 9:1+ (Year 5)
- **Payback period**: ~4.5 months blended
- **Gross margin**: 75-80% (high due to digital delivery)

### Revenue Projections (5 Years)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Customers | 500 | 1,500 | 3,500 | 6,000 | 10,000 |
| ARPU | $15 | $18 | $21 | $23 | $25 |
| MRR | $7,500 | $27,000 | $73,500 | $138,000 | $250,000 |
| ARR | $180K | $504K | $1.26M | $2.18M | $3.72M |
| Growth Rate | — | 180% | 150% | 73% | 71% |

### Sensitivity Analysis
- **Best case**: $9M ARR by Year 5 (viral growth, no competition)
- **Base case**: $3.72M ARR by Year 5 (steady growth, category leadership)
- **Conservative case**: $1.3M ARR by Year 5 (bear market, competitive entry)
- **Key variables**: Conversion rate, churn rate, market size, ARPU

The model demonstrates healthy unit economics with LTV:CAC >3:1 and payback <6 months, positioning MineBox for sustainable growth in the hobbyist mining infrastructure category.
