# MineBox Financial Model Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

---

## 1. Accuracy & Consistency (35%) — Score: 9/10

### Numbers Verification

**Revenue Projections Consistency:**
| Year | ARR (Revenue) | MRR | Customers | ARPU Check |
|------|---------------|-----|-----------|------------|
| 1 | $139,200 | $11,600 | 800 | $14.50 ✓ |
| 2 | $422,400 | $35,200 | 2,200 | $16.00 ✓ |
| 3 | $999,000 | $83,250 | 4,500 | $18.50 ✓ |
| 4 | $1,890,000 | $157,500 | 7,500 | $21.00 ✓ |
| 5 | $3,102,000 | $258,500 | 11,000 | $23.50 ✓ |

All MRR × 12 = ARR calculations are correct.

**Cost Structure Cross-Check:**
- Payment processing fees calculated at 3.5% of ARR — verified correct
- Y1: $139K × 3.5% = $4,865 ≈ $4,900 ✓
- Y5: $3.1M × 3.5% = $108,570 ≈ $108,600 ✓

**Operating Margin Verification:**
| Year | Revenue | OpEx | Operating P/L | Margin |
|------|---------|------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | $139,200 | $216,540 | -$77,340 | -56% ✓ |
| 3 | $999,000 | $1,145,800 | -$146,800 | -15% ✓ |
| 5 | $3,102,000 | $2,466,900 | $635,100 | 20% ✓ |

**LTV Calculations Verified:**
- Starter: ($10 × 75%) / 4% = $187.50 ✓
- Pro: ($25 × 78%) / 3% = $650 ✓
- Enterprise: ($150 × 80%) / 1% = $12,000 ✓

### Minor Issues Found
- Revenue mix percentages in Year 5 breakdown sum to exactly 100% ✓
- Personnel costs include potential double-counting note for Customer Success — acknowledged in document ✓

## 2. Reasonableness (30%) — Score: 7.5/10

### Growth Assumptions Assessment

**Customer Growth:**
- Year 1: 800 paying customers (from 25K TAM = 3.2% penetration) — Reasonable
- Year 5: 11,000 customers (from projected 60K TAM = 18.3% penetration) — Aggressive but achievable for niche leader

**LTV:CAC Analysis:**
| Year | LTV:CAC | Assessment |
|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | 25:1 | Exceptionally high — warrants scrutiny |
| 5 | 18:1 | Still very high but more reasonable |

The 25:1 LTV:CAC ratio exceeds the 3:1 benchmark by 8x. While the thesis explains this through community-driven acquisition, this is optimistic.

**CAC Reality Check:**
- Blended CAC of $12.50 (Year 1) assumes 60% organic acquisition at $5-10
- For a crypto infrastructure startup, this is plausible given community dynamics
- The 5% paid acquisition at $50 CAC is reasonable

**Churn Assumptions:**
- Monthly churn of 4% (Starter) = 48% annual churn — acknowledged as high in the document
- This is honest and aligns with hobbyist project abandonment patterns

### Concerns

1. **ARPU Growth**: From $14.50 to $23.50 (62% increase) over 5 years requires strong tier mix shift — feasible but execution-dependent

2. **Enterprise Tier**: Jump from 16 Enterprise customers (Year 1) to 660 (Year 5) is aggressive for a hobbyist-focused product

3. **Market Size Dependency**: Heavy reliance on Bitaxe market growing 25% annually through Year 5

## 4. Investor-Readiness (15%) — Score: 8.5/10

### Strengths
1. **Compelling Narrative**: Documents tell a coherent story from market opportunity → product → revenue → costs → funding
2. **Honest Risk Assessment**: Churn rates, competitive threats, and market size risks are acknowledged
3. **Aligned Numbers**: All three documents reference the same core metrics
4. **Clear Use of Funds**: Detailed 18-month allocation breakdown
5. **Realistic Exit Expectations**: Not projecting unicorn outcomes; $15-30M exit is grounded

### Potential Red Flags Addressed

- [x] Crypto market volatility acknowledged with sovereignty motivation
- [x] Open-source sustainability model explained with precedents

### Presentation Quality

- Assumptions explicitly stated
- Cross-references between documents

---

## Strengths

1. **Exceptional Internal Consistency**: All three documents align on core metrics ($3.1M ARR, Month 40-42 breakeven, 11K customers Year 5)

2. **Sophisticated Unit Economics**: Deep dive into LTV by tier, contribution margins, and payback periods

3. **Honest Assessment of Risks**: Annual churn of 46% (Year 1) isn't hidden; hobbyist abandonment is acknowledged

4. **Capital Efficiency Story**: "No Series A required" narrative is compelling for crypto-native angels

5. **Realistic TAM**: $12-15M market sizing avoids hyperbolic claims common in pitch decks

6. **Scenario Analysis**: Three scenarios (Best/Base/Conservative) with probability weighting shows rigor

---

## Financial Red Flags

1. **LTV:CAC Ratios Too Good**: 25:1 Year 1 is exceptional even for community-driven products. Real-world friction (support costs, failed signups, refunds) typically increases effective CAC.

2. **Enterprise Tier Projections**: 660 enterprise customers at $150+/month in Year 5 for a hobbyist mining product is optimistic. Enterprise typically means different (mining pools, hardware vendors), which may require different GTM.

3. **Snapshot Infrastructure Costs May Be Understated**: 5-10 full nodes at $150-250/month for multi-coin snapshot generation seems low if maintaining 5+ coins with fresh snapshots.

4. **No Customer Cohort Data**: LTV calculations assume static churn, but hobbyist projects often have "burst and fade" patterns that cohort analysis would reveal.

5. **Hardware Bundle Margin Unclear**: 10-15% of revenue from hardware bundles, but COGS for hardware not explicitly broken out in cost structure.

---

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Adjust LTV:CAC Presentation**: Add a footnote acknowledging that 25:1 is exceptional and provide a sensitivity showing LTV:CAC at 10:1 (still excellent) with corresponding CAC of $31.

2. **Detail Enterprise Segment**: Add a subsection defining what "Enterprise" means for MineBox (mining pools? hardware vendors? education institutions?) and validate the 660-customer Year 5 projection.

3. **Add Hardware COGS**: Include a line item in Cost Structure for hardware bundle COGS (typical 30-50% margin on hardware) to complete the unit economics.

4. **Include Monthly Cash Flow Year 1**: Replace quarterly burn projections with monthly granularity for Year 1 (investors scrutinize early cash management).

5. **Add Cohort Retention Curve**: Include a projected cohort analysis showing customer retention over 12 months post-acquisition, even if estimated.

6. **Stress-Test Node Infrastructure Costs**: Recalculate snapshot infrastructure costs for 5 coins × fresh snapshots × global CDN delivery. Current estimates of $500/mo storage at 100 customers may be under.

## Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**

The financial model is well-constructed and internally consistent, demonstrating strong analytical rigor. The core story is compelling: a capital-efficient open-source SaaS targeting an underserved niche with exceptional unit economics. However, three specific issues require revision before investor presentation:

1. The LTV:CAC ratios (18-25:1) need context or sensitivity analysis showing the model remains viable at more conservative ratios
2. The Enterprise tier projections (660 customers Year 5) need validation or reduction
3. Hardware bundle economics need explicit COGS treatment

These are refinements, not fundamental model problems. With 2-3 hours of work, this model would be investor-ready.
