## MineBox Financial Phase Review

---

### Overall Score: 7.5/10

---

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All three financial documents (Revenue Model, Cost Structure, Funding Strategy) are present and well-organized with clear section headers and tables.

2. **Strong Unit Economics Design**: LTV:CAC ratio of 5:1+ with payback period under 6 months demonstrates sound SaaS fundamentals. The progression from 4.7:1 (Y1) to 13.8:1 (Y5) shows improvement with scale.

3. **Coherent Pricing Strategy**: The tiered pricing ($0/10/25/100-500) aligns well with persona research. Value-based pricing tied to measurable time savings (3 days → 20 minutes) is compelling.

4. **Realistic Cost Scaling**: Infrastructure per-customer cost declining from $8 to $3.30 at scale is reasonable for CDN/storage-heavy workloads.

5. **Conservative Base Case**: Year 5 ARR of $1.25M is achievable for a niche market with 4,180 paying customers at $25 ARPU.

6. **Open-Core Model Justification**: The business model mirrors successful precedents (GitLab, Bitwarden, HashiCorp) and addresses the crypto community's sovereignty concerns.

### Financial Red Flags

1. **Internal Inconsistency - Year 5 ARR Projections**:
   - Revenue Model Executive Summary: "$1.8M - $2.4M" ARR
   - Revenue Model Base Case Table: "$1,254,000" ARR  
   - Funding Strategy: "$1.25M" ARR
   - **This is a significant discrepancy** - the Executive Summary overstates Year 5 targets by 43-91%.

2. **Persistent Operating Losses Through Year 5**:
   - Cost Structure shows OpEx as 197% of revenue in Year 5 ($2.47M costs vs $1.25M revenue)
   - This contradicts the funding strategy's claim of "profitability by Year 4"
   - The numbers don't add up to breakeven within the stated timeline

3. **Breakeven Timeline Inconsistency**:
   - Cost Structure: "Month 48-54" (Year 4 Q4 - Year 5 Q2)
   - Cost Structure also says: "Conservative Breakeven: Month 36"
   - Funding Strategy: "Month 36-48"
   - These conflicting timelines need reconciliation

4. **Year 5 Burn Rate Spike**:
   - Marketing & Sales jumps from $285K (Y4) to $597K (Y5) - a 110% increase
   - Yet revenue only grows 32% (Y4→Y5)
   - This aggressive spend isn't justified by growth trajectory

5. **Missing Sensitivity in Funding Strategy**:
   - Conservative case shows 0.7x-0.9x returns (-5% to -2% IRR)
   - This represents capital loss for seed investors
   - The "capital preservation" label understates actual downside

### Specific Revisions Required

1. **Reconcile Year 5 ARR figures**: Update Revenue Model Executive Summary from "$1.8M - $2.4M" to match base case "$1.25M" OR justify higher targets with updated projections.

2. **Fix P&L math for profitability path**: The Cost Structure shows 197% OpEx/Revenue in Y5. Either reduce costs OR increase revenue projections to demonstrate actual path to breakeven.

3. **Align breakeven timelines**: Pick one consistent timeline (Month 36, 42, 48, or 54) and update all three documents to use the same figure.

4. **Justify Year 5 sales investment**: Explain the strategic rationale for the $597K sales/marketing spend in Y5, or reduce it to align with revenue growth trajectory.

5. **Add cash flow projection table**: Include a simple monthly/quarterly cash flow showing when operating cash flow turns positive.

6. **Update conservative case language**: Rename "Capital Preservation" to "Downside Case" since 0.7x-0.9x is a 10-30% capital loss.

7. **Reconcile ARPU figures**: 
   - Revenue Model shows blended ARPU of $21-25
   - Cost Structure references $22 average MRR
   - Funding Strategy uses $35-40/month in Executive Summary
   - Align these to one consistent figure

8. **Add runway bridge scenario**: Include specific triggers for when bridge funding would be pursued (e.g., "if Y2 MRR <$15K, seek $300K bridge at Month 24")

### Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**: The financial documents are substantively complete but contain internal inconsistencies that would concern investors during due diligence. The key issues are: (1) conflicting Year 5 ARR figures between sections, (2) cost projections that don't align with profitability claims, and (3) inconsistent breakeven timelines. These are readily fixable but must be addressed before investor presentation.
