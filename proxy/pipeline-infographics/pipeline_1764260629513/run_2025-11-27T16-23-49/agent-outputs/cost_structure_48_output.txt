The cost structure document has been updated and aligned with the revenue model. Here's a summary of the analysis:

## Cost Structure Analysis Summary

**Total Operating Expenses (5-Year Projections):**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $390K | $667K | $904K | $1,325K |
| Infrastructure | $27K | $64K | $131K | $210K | $306K |
| Marketing & Sales | $23K | $65K | $195K | $320K | $517K |
| G&A | $40K | $87K | $153K | $229K | $319K |
| **Total** | **$217K** | **$605K** | **$1,146K** | **$1,664K** | **$2,467K** |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Burn Rate**: Peak cumulative losses of ~$750K by Year 3-4
2. **Breakeven**: Month 40-42 (mid-Year 4) at ~$130K MRR
3. **Path to Profitability**: Year 4 operating margin 12%, Year 5 operating margin 20%
4. **Capital Requirements**: Recommended $500K-750K Seed Round

**Unit Economics Highlights:**
- CAC: $12.50-$22 (exceptionally low due to community-driven acquisition)
- LTV:CAC: 18:1 to 25:1 (well above 3:1 threshold)
- CAC Payback: ~1.3 months
- Gross Margin: 75-80%

**Funding Implications:**
- $500K provides 28 months runway (marginal to breakeven)
- $750K provides 42 months runway (comfortable to breakeven with buffer)
- $1M provides 56+ months with significant buffer
