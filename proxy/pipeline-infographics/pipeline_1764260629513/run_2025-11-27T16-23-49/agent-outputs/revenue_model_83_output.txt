The revenue model document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it to verify it covers all required sections and aligns with the thesis and market analysis inputs.

The existing revenue model document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/01-revenue-model.md` is already complete and well-structured. It includes:

## Revenue Model Review Summary

**All Required Sections Present:**

- ✅ Revenue Projections (5-year table with customers, ARPU, MRR, ARR, growth)
- ✅ Revenue Growth Assumptions (acquisition, churn, expansion, market penetration)
- ✅ Sensitivity Analysis (best/base/conservative cases with key variables)

**Key Financial Projections:**
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Customers | 1,200 | 3,500 | 7,500 | 12,000 | 18,000 |
| ARPU | $14 | $16 | $17 | $18 | $19 |
| MRR | $16.8K | $56K | $127.5K | $216K | $342K |
| ARR | $201.6K | $672K | $1.53M | $2.59M | $4.1M |

**Unit Economics:**
- LTV:CAC ratio: 13.9-18.7x (excellent)
- Payback period: 1.2-1.8 months
- Gross margin: 80-86%

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Free: $0 (full self-hosted functionality)
- Starter: $10/month (1 coin sync)
- Pro: $25/month (5 coins, priority support)
- Enterprise: Custom ($100-500/month)

**Thesis Target Validation:**
The model achieves $50K MRR by Month 20 (Year 2), validating the thesis target of "$50K+ MRR potential."
