I have created a comprehensive funding strategy document for MineBox at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md`. Here's a summary of the key elements:

## Funding Strategy Summary

**Recommendation**: Raise $750,000 Seed Round at $3M Pre-Money Valuation

### Key Highlights:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Capital Required | $500K - $750K |
| Time to Breakeven | Month 40-42 |
| Founder Ownership Post-Seed | 75% |
| Expected Investor MOIC | 3-5x (base case) |
| Year 5 ARR Target | $3.1M at 20% operating margin |

### Use of Funds:
- **Product Development (40%)**: $300K - Engineering, security audits, documentation
- **Sales & Marketing (20%)**: $150K - Content, community, partnerships
- **Operations (15%)**: $112.5K - Infrastructure, DevOps, support
- **G&A (10%)**: $75K - Legal, accounting, insurance
- **Reserve (15%)**: $112.5K - Buffer and contingency

### Investment Thesis:
1. **Exceptional unit economics**: LTV:CAC of 18-25:1 vs. 3:1 benchmark
2. **Capital efficient**: $750K to profitability without Series A required
3. **Clear market timing**: 10,000+ Bitaxe owners, underserved segment
4. **Open-source advantage**: Community-driven CAC reduction

### Exit Considerations:
- Primary path: Strategic acquisition by Umbrel, Start9, or hardware manufacturer
- Expected valuation: $15-30M (5-6x ARR) in Year 5-7
- Investor returns: 3-6x multiple on seed investment

The document aligns with the revenue model ($3.1M ARR Year 5) and cost structure (breakeven Month 40-42, peak cumulative loss ~$750K).
