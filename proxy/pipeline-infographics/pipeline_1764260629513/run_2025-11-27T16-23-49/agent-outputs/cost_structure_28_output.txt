The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me verify its completeness against the required format and update it if needed.

Reviewing the existing document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md`, it already contains:

1. **Cost Structure Overview** - Fixed vs. variable breakdown, cost allocation philosophy, key cost drivers
2. **Operating Expenses by Category**:
   - Personnel Costs (headcount plan, salary ranges, contractors, hiring timeline)
   - Infrastructure Costs (cloud/hosting, third-party services, tools, scaling curves)
   - Marketing & Sales Costs (CAC, budget allocation, sales team, channel costs)
   - G&A (facilities, legal/accounting, insurance, other overhead)
3. **Cost Projections (5 Years)** - Complete table with all categories
4. **Burn Rate Analysis** - Monthly burn, runway calculations, milestones vs. cash
5. **Breakeven Analysis** - Breakeven point, timeline, path to profitability
6. **Cost Optimization Opportunities** - Efficiency improvements, scale economics, automation

The document is complete and well-structured. It aligns with the revenue model (which shows $115K Year 1 ARR growing to $1.254M Year 5 ARR) and the thesis (open-core model for hobbyist mining infrastructure).

The cost structure is already saved to the correct location: `business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md`

Key findings from the cost structure:
- **Total Year 1 OpEx**: $215K (against $115K revenue = -$100K loss)
- **Total Year 5 OpEx**: $2.47M (against $1.25M revenue = still loss, growth mode)
- **Breakeven**: Month 48-54 with full investment, or Month 36 with capital-efficient approach
- **Recommended Initial Capital**: $400-500K for 16-20 months runway
- **Gross Margin**: 72% → 82% improving with scale
- **LTV:CAC**: 5:1 → 14:1 over 5 years
