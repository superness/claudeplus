Now I have all the financial documents. Let me conduct a thorough review.

## MineBox Financial Model Review

### Overall Score: 8/10

### Strengths

1. **Exceptional Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC ratios of 18-25:1 are outstanding (industry average is 3-5:1). The sub-1.5 month payback period is similarly exceptional and suggests a capital-efficient model if assumptions hold.

2. **Internal Consistency**: All three documents align well:
   - Revenue model projects $3.1M ARR Year 5
   - Cost structure shows $2.47M OpEx Year 5 → 20% operating margin
   - Funding strategy correctly references both models

3. **Realistic Cost Scaling**: Infrastructure cost per customer declining from $8/month (100 customers) to $2.60/month (10,000 customers) reflects genuine SaaS economies of scale.

4. **Thoughtful Pricing Strategy**: Value-based pricing capturing <2% of user time savings provides pricing headroom. The $10/$25 price points are psychologically appropriate for hobbyist market.

5. **Comprehensive Sensitivity Analysis**: Best/Base/Conservative scenarios with probability weightings (20%/55%/25%) demonstrate mature financial thinking.

6. **Capital Efficiency**: Single-round path to profitability is attractive to investors. The $625K raise reaching breakeven at Month 40-42 is well-justified.

7. **Strong Gross Margins**: 75-80% gross margins are consistent with healthy SaaS businesses and infrastructure scales efficiently.

### Financial Red Flags

1. **Churn Rate Optimism**: The revenue model shows annual blended churn declining from 46% → 26%. While directionally reasonable, these are optimistic for a hobbyist product. Hobby projects have high abandonment rates.

2. **CAC May Be Underestimated**: $12.50-$22 blended CAC relies heavily on organic/community acquisition (60% at $5-10). If community channels saturate faster than projected, CAC could spike significantly in Years 3-5.

3. **Enterprise Tier Assumptions Untested**: The model projects 660 Enterprise customers at $150+/month by Year 5 (6% of customers, 13% of revenue). This B2B segment is speculative for a hobbyist-focused product.

4. **Market Size Dependency**: The entire model depends on the Bitaxe/hobbyist mining TAM estimate of 25,000+ owners growing to 60,000 by Year 5. If this market is 50% smaller, projections collapse proportionally.

5. **Year 3-4 Cost Spike**: OpEx jumps from $605K (Y2) to $1.15M (Y3) — an 89% increase — while revenue only grows from $422K to $999K. The negative operating margin persists longer than typical SaaS.

6. **Customer Success Costs Double-Counted**: The cost structure notes "Customer Success personnel costs included here; avoid double-counting with Personnel section" but the personnel table also includes Customer Success as a line item. Verify these aren't summed twice.

### Specific Revisions Required

1. **Verify Customer Success Cost Allocation**: Lines 229-233 of cost structure show $0→$220K for Customer Success in Marketing & Sales section. Lines 81-82 show Customer Success salary of $70K-125K. Confirm these are not double-counted in the Total OpEx.

2. **Add Churn Sensitivity**: Include a specific scenario showing impact of 50% higher churn rates (e.g., monthly Starter churn of 7.5% instead of 5%). This is a material risk for hobby products.

3. **Stress Test CAC Assumptions**: Model a scenario where organic acquisition drops from 60% to 40% of total and paid acquisition increases proportionally. Show impact on breakeven timeline.

4. **Clarify Enterprise Customer Definition**: The $150/month Enterprise tier with 660 customers by Year 5 needs validation. Are these truly enterprise or just larger hobbyists? What's the evidence for this segment?

5. **Reconcile Y4 Breakeven Math**: The burn rate analysis shows cumulative loss of ~$750K at peak, but the cost structure shows operating losses of $77K(Y1) + $183K(Y2) + $147K(Y3) = $407K. The runway calculations use different burn assumptions than the operating margin projections.

6. **Add Cash Flow Statement**: The current documents show P&L-style projections but no cash flow statement. With annual billing incentives (20% discount), actual cash collection may differ from recognized revenue.

### Math Verification

**Revenue Model Check (Year 5):**
- 11,000 customers × $23.50 ARPU = $258,500 MRR ✓
- $258,500 × 12 = $3,102,000 ARR ✓

**Cost Structure Check (Year 5):**
- Personnel: $1,325,000
- Infrastructure: $305,600  
- Marketing & Sales: $517,000
- G&A: $319,300
- **Total: $2,466,900** ✓ (matches stated $2,466,900)

**Funding Strategy Alignment:**
- Pre-money: $2M + Raise: $625K = Post-money: $2.625M ✓
- Seed ownership: $625K / $2.625M = 23.8% (document states 22.7% — minor discrepancy)
- Founder ownership: 100% - 22.7% - 4.5% pool = 72.8% ✓

**Breakeven Check:**
- Fixed costs: $95K/month × Contribution margin $14/customer = 6,786 customers ✓
- 6,786 × $21 ARPU = $142,506/month ✓
- ARR: $1.71M ✓

### Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**

The financial model is substantially complete and demonstrates strong fundamentals. However, there are several specific issues that should be addressed before presenting to investors:

1. A potential double-counting issue with Customer Success costs
2. Missing sensitivity analysis for the highest-risk variable (churn)
3. Minor math discrepancy in ownership percentage calculation
4. Lack of cash flow statement for a business with annual billing incentives

The unit economics are exceptional *if* the community-driven CAC and low churn assumptions hold. These assumptions are the critical investment risks and deserve more rigorous stress-testing in the model.

After addressing the 6 specific revisions above, this financial model would be investor-ready.
