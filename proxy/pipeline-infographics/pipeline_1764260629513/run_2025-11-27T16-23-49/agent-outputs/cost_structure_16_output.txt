The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it against the required output format to ensure it meets all requirements:

**Reviewing the existing document against requirements:**

The document at `business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is complete and well-structured. Key highlights:

**Cost Structure Summary:**

- **Total 5-Year OpEx**: $215K (Y1) → $2.47M (Y5)
- **Cost Mix**: Personnel 55-60%, Infrastructure 22-24%, Marketing 19-48%, G&A 21-34%
- **Breakeven**: ~5,000 paying customers, ~$110K MRR, Month 48-54 (growth-focused) or Month 36 (capital-efficient)
- **Recommended Initial Capital**: $400K-500K for 16-20 month runway
- **Key Efficiency Levers**: Per-customer infra cost decreases from $8 to $3.30 at scale

**Alignment with Revenue Model:**
- Infrastructure costs validate the 75-80% gross margin projections
- CAC estimates ($40-75) align with unit economics
- Burn rate analysis supports the funding strategy recommendations

The cost structure is comprehensive and ready to inform the funding strategy development.
