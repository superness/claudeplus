The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it against the revenue model and cost structure to verify completeness and alignment:

The existing funding strategy document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` is already comprehensive and well-aligned with the thesis, revenue model, and cost structure. It includes:

**Funding Requirements:**
- Total capital required: $500K-750K (Seed)
- Funding milestones and tranches
- Runway requirements with scenario analysis

**Use of Funds:**
- Detailed allocation table: Product Development (40%), Sales & Marketing (20%), Operations (15%), G&A (10%), Working Capital (15%)
- 18-month deployment breakdown

**Funding Strategy:**
- Preferred funding sources ranked (Angels, Micro-VCs, Strategic, RBF)
- Bootstrap vs. raise analysis
- Revenue-based financing considerations
- Equity vs. debt analysis

**Investment Thesis:**
- Why investors should fund MineBox (market timing, unit economics, capital efficiency, path to profitability)

**Funding Timeline:**

**Cap Table Projections:**
- Post-Seed cap table (Founders 75%, Pool 10%, Seed 15%)
- Seed round target terms

**Exit Considerations:**

The document is complete, thorough, and properly cross-referenced with the revenue model ($3.1M ARR Year 5, LTV:CAC 18-25:1) and cost structure (breakeven Month 40-42, peak cumulative loss ~$750K).
