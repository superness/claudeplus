The cost structure document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it to verify it covers all required sections and aligns with the thesis, revenue model, and operations plan inputs.

The existing cost structure document at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/study/business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is already complete and well-structured. Here's my review:

## Cost Structure Review Summary

**All Required Sections Present:**
- ✅ Cost Structure Overview (fixed vs. variable, allocation philosophy, key drivers)
- ✅ Operating Expenses by Category (Personnel, Infrastructure, Marketing & Sales, G&A)
- ✅ Cost Projections (5-year table with all categories)
- ✅ Burn Rate Analysis (monthly projections, runway calculations, milestones vs. cash)
- ✅ Breakeven Analysis (units/customers, timeline, path to profitability)
- ✅ Cost Optimization Opportunities (efficiency improvements, scale economics, automation)

**Key Financial Projections:**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $390K | $667K | $904K | $1,325K |
| Infrastructure | $27K | $64K | $131K | $210K | $306K |
| Marketing & Sales | $23K | $65K | $195K | $320K | $517K |
| G&A | $42K | $95K | $171K | $254K | $354K |
| **Total OpEx** | **$219K** | **$614K** | **$1,164K** | **$1,688K** | **$2,502K** |

**Key Metrics:**
- Breakeven: Month 26-28 (~5,833 customers at $99K MRR)
- Operating margin Year 5: 39%
- Recommended capital: $250K-400K pre-seed/seed
- Peak cumulative burn: ~$260K (Year 3 Q1)
- Per-customer cost declining from $22 → $17/mo with scale

**Alignment with Revenue Model:**
- Year 1: -8% operating margin (near breakeven)
- Year 2 onward: Profitable operations
- Year 5: $4.1M ARR vs. $2.5M OpEx = 39% margin
- LTV:CAC ratio 14-18:1 supported by $15-25 CAC

**Thesis Alignment:**
The cost structure supports the thesis of sustainable open-source business model with $50K+ MRR achieved by Month 20, requiring modest capital ($250-400K) with clear path to profitability.
