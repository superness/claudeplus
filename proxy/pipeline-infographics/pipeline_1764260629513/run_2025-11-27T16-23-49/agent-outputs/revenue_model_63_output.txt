## Revenue Model Summary

The MineBox revenue model document at `business-plan/financial/01-revenue-model.md` is now complete and aligned with the thesis. Key highlights:

### Revenue Model Overview
- **Primary Model**: Open-Core SaaS with subscription-based infrastructure services
- **Revenue Mix (Steady State)**: 68-75% Subscriptions, 10-15% Hardware, 8-12% Premium Support, 5-13% Enterprise

### Pricing Strategy
- **Free Tier**: $0 - Full software, self-hosted, community support
- **Starter**: $10/month - 1 mainnet coin snapshot sync
- **Pro**: $25/month - Up to 5 coins, priority support, API access
- **Enterprise**: $100+/month custom - Unlimited coins, SLA, white-label

### Unit Economics
- **Blended CAC**: $12.50 (Year 1) → $22.00 (Year 5)
- **Blended LTV**: $315 (conservative) → $1,554 (steady state)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 18:1 to 25:1 (exceptional)
- **Payback Period**: 1.1-1.3 months
- **Gross Margin**: 73-80%

### Revenue Projections (5 Years)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Paying Customers | 800 | 2,200 | 4,500 | 7,500 | 11,000 |
| ARPU | $14.50 | $16.00 | $18.50 | $21.00 | $23.50 |
| MRR | $11,600 | $35,200 | $83,250 | $157,500 | $258,500 |
| ARR | $139,200 | $422,400 | $999,000 | $1,890,000 | $3,102,000 |
| Growth Rate | — | 203% | 137% | 89% | 64% |

### Sensitivity Analysis
- **Best Case** (20% probability): $5.4M ARR by Year 5
- **Base Case** (55% probability): $3.1M ARR by Year 5
- **Conservative** (25% probability): $1.45M ARR by Year 5
- **Probability-Weighted**: $3.0M ARR by Year 5

The model validates the thesis target of $50K+ MRR potential, achieving this milestone between months 18-22 in the base case.
