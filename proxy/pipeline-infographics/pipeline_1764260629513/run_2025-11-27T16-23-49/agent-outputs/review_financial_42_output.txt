# MineBox Financial Analysis Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

## Strengths

### 1. **Exceptional Internal Consistency**
- All three documents align on key metrics: $3.72M ARR Year 5, breakeven Month 30-33, 10,000 paying customers
- Cost structure OpEx ($218K Year 1) correctly ties to funding requirement ($250-300K)
- LTV:CAC ratios consistent across revenue model (3.3:1 → 16.7:1) and funding thesis

### 2. **Healthy Unit Economics**
- LTV:CAC ratio starts at 3.3:1 (acceptable) and improves to 16.7:1 (excellent)
- Gross margins 75-80% are strong for infrastructure SaaS
- CAC payback period of 4.5 months blended is well below the 12-month rule of thumb

### 3. **Thorough Scenario Analysis**
- Best/Base/Conservative cases with probability weightings (20%/55%/25%)
- Sensitivity analysis covers key variables (conversion, churn, market size)
- Expected value calculations provide probability-weighted outcomes

### 4. **Reasonable Cost Assumptions**
- Personnel costs grow proportionally with revenue (71% → 36% of revenue)
- Infrastructure per-customer costs decline with scale ($8 → $2.60)
- Lean G&A with remote-first model

### 5. **Clear Funding Rationale**
- Capital ask ($250-300K) directly maps to runway requirements (28 months)
- Use of funds breakdown is specific and justified
- Exit analysis provides multiple paths with realistic multiples

## Financial Red Flags

### 1. **LTV Calculation Methodology Inconsistency** ⚠️
- Revenue model executive summary shows LTV:CAC of 3.5:1 in Year 1 (line 17)
- But detailed LTV:CAC targets show 3.3:1 in Year 1 (line 261)
- Minor discrepancy but should be reconciled

### 2. **ARPU Inconsistency Between Documents** ⚠️
- Revenue model projects blended ARPU of $15-$25/month (lines 335)
- But LTV calculation uses $18 ARPU with 3.5% churn → $401 LTV
- At $15 ARPU Year 1, actual LTV would be ~$334

### 3. **Aggressive Conversion Rate Assumptions**
- 15-20% free-to-paid conversion is optimistic for open-source software
- Industry benchmarks for open-source freemium typically show 2-5%
- May need to adjust projections or justify with comparable data

### 4. **Churn Rate May Be Optimistic**
- 3.5% monthly blended churn (42% annual) is used in LTV calculation
- But churn assumptions table shows 4% blended monthly (48% annual)
- Crypto market volatility may drive higher actual churn (5-6%+)

### 5. **Funding Strategy Valuation Cap Inconsistency** ⚠️
- Funding strategy summary recommends $2M cap (line 680)
- But detailed SAFE terms suggest $2.5-3M cap (lines 256-257)
- Should align on single recommended cap

### 6. **Customer Success Double-Counting Risk**
- Customer Success appears in both Personnel costs (line 56) and Sales costs (line 231)
- Document notes to avoid double-counting, but totals should be verified

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Reconcile LTV:CAC discrepancy**: Standardize Year 1 LTV:CAC to either 3.3:1 or 3.5:1 across all documents and tables

2. **Fix ARPU consistency**: Ensure LTV calculations use the same ARPU figures as revenue projections ($15 Year 1, not $18)

3. **Justify or revise free-to-paid conversion**: Either provide comparable data supporting 15-20% conversion OR adjust to 8-12% with revised revenue projections

4. **Align churn rate assumptions**: Use consistent monthly churn (either 3.5% or 4%) across all calculations

5. **Standardize valuation cap**: Choose either $2M or $2.5M cap and update all references in funding strategy

6. **Verify no double-counting**: Add explicit note showing Customer Success costs are allocated to one section only with clear cross-reference

7. **Add ARR calculation verification**: Total MRR × 12 should equal ARR. Verify:
   - Year 1: MRR $15,000 × 12 = $180,000 ARR ✓
   - Year 5: MRR $310,000 × 12 = $3,720,000 ARR ✓

8. **Add revenue mix math check**: Verify subscription/hardware/support percentages sum to 100% each year

## Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**: The financial model is well-structured and largely sound, but contains several minor inconsistencies that would undermine credibility in investor due diligence. The core unit economics and projections are reasonable, but the discrepancies in LTV:CAC ratios, ARPU figures, and valuation cap recommendations need to be resolved before presenting to investors.

The conversion rate assumption (15-20%) is the most significant concern and may require supporting evidence or downward revision.

Once the 8 specific revisions are addressed, this financial model would be investor-ready.
