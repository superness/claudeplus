Now I have all three financial documents. Let me conduct a comprehensive financial review.

# MineBox Financial Analysis Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

## Strengths

### Accuracy & Consistency (Excellent)
1. **Numbers align across all three documents**: Revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5) flows correctly to cost structure ($2.5M OpEx Year 5) and funding strategy ($350K raise targeting breakeven Month 26-28)
2. **Internal math is correct**: Unit economics calculations (LTV = ARPU × GM / Churn) verify correctly. Example: Pro tier $25 × 82% / 3% = $683 LTV ✓
3. **Cost projections sum properly**: Personnel + Infrastructure + M&S + G&A = Total OpEx across all years
4. **Revenue by stream sums to total**: Subscriptions + Hardware + Support + Enterprise = Total Revenue in each year

### Unit Economics (Outstanding)
- **LTV:CAC of 14-18x** is exceptional (industry benchmark: 3-5x)
- **Sub-2-month CAC payback** is outstanding (industry: 12-18 months)
- **81-86% gross margins** are strong for SaaS
- These metrics consistently flow across all documents

### Model Sophistication
- Comprehensive sensitivity analysis with Best/Base/Conservative scenarios
- Probability-weighted expected value calculation ($4.46M ARR)
- Detailed cohort analysis and churn modeling
- Thorough breakeven analysis with multiple path scenarios

### Strategic Alignment
- Thesis ($50K+ MRR potential) validated by projections (Month 20)
- Open-source + paid infrastructure model well-rationalized
- Pricing strategy (Free → $10 → $25) aligned with hobbyist persona

## Financial Red Flags

### 1. **NRR Below 100% Through Year 5** (Moderate Concern)
- Year 5 NRR projected at 94%, still below 100%
- This means the business never achieves "negative churn" where existing customers grow faster than churn
- For a SaaS business at this scale, NRR should reach 100%+ by Year 3-4

### 2. **Year 1 ARR Discrepancy**
- Revenue model states ARR of $201,600 (line 324)
- But also states "Total Revenue" of $160,000 (line 335)
- The difference (~$41K) isn't explained—likely timing difference between end-of-year ARR run rate vs. actual collected revenue, but should be clarified

### 3. **Customer Counts Don't Match Across Documents**
- Revenue model: 1,400 new customers Year 1, 1,200 net adds (lines 319-321)
- Cost structure: "800 new customers" for CAC calculation (line 193)
- This inconsistency affects CAC budget calculations

### 4. **CAC Numbers Inconsistent**
- Revenue model: CAC $15 Year 1, $20 Year 2, $25 Year 3 (lines 206-210)
- Cost structure: CAC $12.50 Year 1, $15 Year 2, $18 Year 3 (line 193-197)
- These should be aligned

### 5. **ARPU Assumptions Aggressive**
- Assumes ARPU grows from $14 to $19 over 5 years (35% increase)
- Simultaneously assumes Pro tier percentage grows from 35% to 54%
- While directionally correct, the combination may be optimistic given pricing power constraints in hobbyist markets

### 6. **Hardware Bundle Revenue Mechanics Unclear**
- Hardware bundles projected at $410K Year 5 (10% of revenue)
- Unit economics for hardware not detailed (margin, inventory, logistics)
- Could be higher COGS than assumed in gross margin calculations

### 7. **International PPP Pricing Impact Not Modeled**
- Document shows 40-60% regional discounts for PPP pricing
- Revenue projections don't appear to account for blended ARPU reduction from international expansion
- Year 5 targets 40,000 free users (likely international)—paid conversion at lower ARPU not modeled

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Reconcile Year 1 ARR vs. Revenue discrepancy**: Add a note explaining the $41,600 difference between $201,600 ARR and $160,000 total revenue (likely ARR is December run-rate × 12, while total revenue is actual collected)

2. **Align customer acquisition numbers**: Cost structure CAC calculation (800 customers) should match revenue model (1,400 new customers Year 1). Either adjust the marketing budget or the customer count.

3. **Standardize CAC projections**: Use consistent CAC numbers across both documents ($15/$20/$25 or $12.50/$15/$18—pick one and update both)

4. **Add hardware bundle unit economics**: Include gross margin on hardware bundles (likely 20-30% vs. 81% on subscriptions). This affects blended gross margin.

5. **Model PPP pricing impact on ARPU**: If targeting significant international expansion (especially Asia/Africa at 60% discount), Year 5 blended ARPU of $19 needs adjustment or segmentation

6. **Explain path to NRR > 100%**: Either adjust expansion revenue assumptions or explain why sub-100% NRR is acceptable for this niche market

7. **Add working capital timing for hardware**: Hardware bundles require inventory investment. Add a line item in Use of Funds or explain drop-ship model

## Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**

The financial model is comprehensive, well-structured, and demonstrates sophisticated thinking. The core unit economics are compelling (14-18x LTV:CAC, sub-2-month payback), and the path to $4.1M ARR is plausible.

However, there are **internal inconsistencies** (customer counts, CAC figures, Year 1 ARR vs. revenue) that would raise questions in investor due diligence. The discrepancies aren't fatal—they appear to be editing artifacts rather than fundamental model problems—but they need to be reconciled before presenting to investors.

**Required fixes are modest**: 2-3 hours of reconciliation work to align numbers across documents. Once corrected, this financial model would be investor-ready.
