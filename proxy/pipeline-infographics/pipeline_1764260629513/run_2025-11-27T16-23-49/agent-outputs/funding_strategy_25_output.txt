The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it against the required output format and the inputs from the revenue model and cost structure to ensure it's complete and aligned.

The existing document covers:
- ✓ Funding Requirements (Total capital, milestones, runway)
- ✓ Use of Funds (Detailed table with percentages)
- ✓ Funding Strategy (Sources, bootstrap vs raise, RBF, equity vs debt)
- ✓ Investment Thesis (Why invest, highlights, risk mitigation, returns)
- ✓ Funding Timeline (Rounds, milestones)
- ✓ Investor Targeting (Ideal profile, target types, strategic vs financial, value-add)
- ✓ Cap Table Projections (Founder equity, option pool, dilution)
- ✓ Exit Considerations (Paths, comparables, timeline, return projections)

The document is already complete, comprehensive, and well-aligned with:
- Revenue model: References $1.25M base case ARR, $2.4M upside, $660K conservative
- Cost structure: Uses the $215K Y1, $595K Y2 burn rates, breakeven Month 36-54 timeline
- Thesis: Aligns with open-core SaaS, Raspberry Pi focus, hobbyist miner market

The funding strategy document at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` is **already complete and comprehensive**. It includes all required sections:

**Funding Requirements**
- Total capital: $500K-600K recommended (capital-efficient) to $750K-1M (growth-aggressive)
- Milestones: Pre-seed ($100K) → Seed ($400K) → Bridge ($150K optional) → Series A ($1.5M optional)
- Runway: 18-24 months minimum, reaching $25K MRR by Month 15

**Use of Funds**
| Category | Amount | % | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---|---------|
| Product Development | $225K | 45% | Engineering, security audits |
| Sales & Marketing | $100K | 20% | Content, events, partnerships |
| Operations | $100K | 20% | Infrastructure, legal, compliance |
| Working Capital | $75K | 15% | Buffer, runway extension |

**Funding Strategy**
- Preferred sources: Founder capital (1st) → Strategic angels (2nd) → Community round (3rd)
- Bootstrap vs raise: Strategic angel round recommended for speed-to-market
- RBF considerations: Viable at $25K+ MRR for non-dilutive growth capital

**Investment Thesis**
- Market: Underserved $10M+ hobbyist mining niche
- Unit economics: LTV:CAC 5:1+, 78% gross margin, <6 month payback
- Return scenarios: 0.9x (conservative) to 11x (breakout)

**Cap Table Projections**
- Post-seed: Founder 72.7%, Investors 18.2%, Option pool 9.1%
- Dilution path: 100% → 72.7% (seed) → 55-60% (Series A)

**Exit Considerations**
- Primary path: Strategic acquisition (60% probability, Year 4-6)
- Comparable exits: Slush Pool, Casa, Umbrel valuations
- Target: 4-6x ARR multiple ($5-15M exit value)
