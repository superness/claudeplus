I can see there's already a comprehensive cost structure document in place. Let me review it against the thesis and revenue model to determine if it's complete or needs any updates.

The existing cost structure document at `business-plan/financial/02-cost-structure.md` is **thorough and well-aligned** with both the thesis and revenue model. It includes:

**Cost Structure Overview:**
- Fixed vs. variable cost breakdown (45-55% each)
- Cost allocation philosophy (product-first, community leverage, automation priority, lean operations)
- Key cost drivers (snapshot storage, engineering talent, customer acquisition, multi-coin infrastructure)

**Operating Expenses by Category:**

**Personnel Costs:**
- Headcount plan: 1 FTE (Year 1) → 11 FTE (Year 5)
- Salary ranges with benefits (25-30% overhead)
- Hiring timeline tied to MRR milestones ($5K → first hire, $50K → customer success)
- Contractor costs: $47K-$115K annually (security audits, legal, accounting, design)
- Total personnel: $127K (Y1) → $1.325M (Y5)

**Infrastructure Costs:**
- Cloud/hosting: $22.8K (Y1) → $262.8K (Y5)
- Per-customer cost improvement: $8/mo at 100 customers → $2.60/mo at 10,000 customers
- Third-party services and tools detailed
- Total infrastructure: $26.5K (Y1) → $305.6K (Y5)

**Marketing & Sales Costs:**
- Low CAC targets: $12.50 (Y1) → $22 (Y5) — community-driven
- Marketing budget: $22K (Y1) → $180K (Y5)
- No traditional sales team; founder-led sales through Y2
- Total M&S: $23K (Y1) → $517K (Y5)

**General & Administrative:**
- Fully remote, no physical office
- Legal/accounting/insurance
- Payment processing (3.5% of revenue)
- Total G&A: $42K (Y1) → $354K (Y5)

**5-Year Cost Projections:**

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Personnel | $127K | $390K | $667K | $904K | $1,325K |
| Infrastructure | $26.5K | $63.5K | $131K | $210K | $306K |
| Marketing | $23K | $65K | $195K | $320K | $517K |
| G&A | $42K | $95K | $171K | $254K | $354K |
| **Total** | **$219K** | **$614K** | **$1.16M** | **$1.69M** | **$2.50M** |

**Burn Rate Analysis:**
- Peak cumulative burn: ~$260K in Y3 Q1
- Monthly breakeven: Month 26-28
- Recommended initial capital: $250K-400K

**Breakeven Analysis:**
- Breakeven customers: 5,833 (at Year 3 run rate)
- Breakeven ARR: ~$1.19M
- Breakeven timeline: Month 26-28 (Early Year 3)

**Cost Optimization Opportunities:**
- Snapshot storage optimization: 20-30% savings
- CDN/P2P delivery: 15-25% savings
- Community support leverage: 40-50% savings
- Automation investments detailed with ROI

**Key Metrics:**
- Operating margin: -8% (Y1) → 39% (Y5)
- Gross margin: 80% → 86%
- OpEx as % of revenue: 108% → 61%
- LTV:CAC: 14:1 → 18:1

**Funding Implications:**
- Bootstrap ($50K): 8 months runway — High risk
- Angel/Pre-Seed ($250-300K): 26-31 months runway — Medium risk
- Seed ($400-500K): 42-52 months runway — Low risk

The document is complete, comprehensive, and properly aligned with:
- Revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5 base case)
- Thesis requirements ($50K+ MRR target)
- Market analysis (community-first marketing, low CAC)
- Unit economics from revenue model

**No updates needed.** The cost structure is ready to proceed to funding strategy.
