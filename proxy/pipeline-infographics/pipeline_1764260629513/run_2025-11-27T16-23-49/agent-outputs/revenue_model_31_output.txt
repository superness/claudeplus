I see there's already a comprehensive revenue model document in place. Looking at the market review feedback, the reviewer mentioned this is "APPROVED" and "Ready to proceed to financial phase." Since the revenue model already exists and appears complete, I should confirm the current state meets the requirements and signal completion to move to the next stage (cost structure).

Let me verify the document covers all required sections and then write the confirmation:

The existing revenue model document at `business-plan/financial/01-revenue-model.md` is already comprehensive and covers all required sections:

✅ **Revenue Model Overview** - Primary revenue streams (Snapshot Sync Subscriptions 70%, Premium Support 15%, Hardware Bundles 10%, Enterprise 5%), model type (Open-Core SaaS), revenue mix projections

✅ **Pricing Strategy** - Philosophy (value-based, self-sovereignty aligned), 4 tiers (Community Free, Starter $10/mo, Pro $25/mo, Enterprise custom), price point analysis vs competitors and value delivered, pricing psychology, promotional/introductory pricing

✅ **Unit Economics** - CAC estimates ($50-75 blended), LTV projections ($490 average), LTV:CAC targets (5:1+), payback period (<6 months), gross margin analysis (75-80%), contribution margin per customer

✅ **Revenue Projections (5 Years)** - Complete table with customers, ARPU, MRR, ARR, growth rates through Year 5

✅ **Revenue Growth Assumptions** - Customer acquisition, churn rate, expansion revenue, market penetration assumptions

✅ **Sensitivity Analysis** - Best case, base case, conservative case scenarios with key variables

The document is thorough and aligns with the thesis and market analysis inputs. The pricing recommendations ($0/Free, $10/Starter, $25/Pro) match the competitive analysis recommendations. The 5-year projections are grounded in the market sizing (SOM of $600K-1.2M annually, targeting 18-20% penetration by Year 5).

**Key Highlights:**
- Year 5 ARR target: $1.25M (base case) to $2.4M (best case)
- Paying customers by Year 5: 4,180 (base) to 6,500 (best)
- Unit economics are healthy: LTV:CAC 5:1+, payback <6 months
- Gross margins: 75-80% at scale

The revenue model is complete and ready for the next stage.
