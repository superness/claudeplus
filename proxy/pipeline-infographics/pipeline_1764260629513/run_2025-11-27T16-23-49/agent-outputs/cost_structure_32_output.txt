The cost structure document is comprehensive and already exists. Let me verify it covers all required sections per the task specification:

**Required Sections Checklist:**
- ✅ Cost Structure Overview (Fixed vs. variable, allocation philosophy, key drivers)
- ✅ Personnel Costs (Headcount plan, salary ranges, benefits, contractors, hiring timeline)
- ✅ Infrastructure Costs (Cloud/hosting, third-party services, tools, scaling curves)
- ✅ Marketing & Sales Costs (CAC, budget allocation, sales team, channel costs)
- ✅ General & Administrative (Office/facilities, legal, insurance, overhead)
- ✅ Cost Projections (5 Years) - Complete table with all categories
- ✅ Burn Rate Analysis (Monthly projections, runway, milestones vs. cash)
- ✅ Breakeven Analysis (Point calculation, timeline, path to profitability)
- ✅ Cost Optimization Opportunities (Efficiency, scale economics, automation)

The document is complete and well-structured. It aligns with the revenue model projections (455 → 4,180 customers, $115K → $1.25M ARR) and provides detailed cost breakdowns across all categories.

**Key Summary:**
- **Total OpEx Year 1**: $215,240
- **Total OpEx Year 5**: $2,473,500
- **Breakeven**: 5,000 customers / $110K MRR / ~Month 48-54 (growth-focused) or Month 36-42 (capital-efficient)
- **Recommended Funding**: $400K-500K for bootstrap path, $500K-750K for seed round
- **Gross Margin at Scale**: 78-82%
- **Personnel**: 55-60% of costs (lean, senior-heavy team growing from 1 to 11 FTEs)

The cost structure is ready for the funding strategy phase.
