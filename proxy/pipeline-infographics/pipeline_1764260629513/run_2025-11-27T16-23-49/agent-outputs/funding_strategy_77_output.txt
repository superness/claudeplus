The funding strategy document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review it against the requirements and the input from previous stages to determine if any updates are needed.

Looking at the existing document, it already covers:
- Funding Requirements with total capital, milestones, and runway
- Use of Funds with detailed category breakdown
- Funding Strategy including preferred sources, bootstrap vs. raise, RBF, equity vs. debt
- Investment Thesis with reasons to invest, highlights, risk mitigation, and returns
- Funding Timeline with rounds and milestones
- Investor Targeting with ideal profile, target investors, strategic vs. financial
- Cap Table Projections including founder equity, ESOP, ownership by round, dilution
- Exit Considerations with paths, comparables, timeline, and return projections

The document is well-aligned with:
- The thesis refinement (hobbyist mining, open-source, snapshot infrastructure)
- Revenue model ($4.1M ARR Year 5, $50K MRR Month 20)
- Cost structure (breakeven Month 26-28, $260K peak burn)

The existing document is comprehensive and complete. No significant updates are needed.
