Market analysis complete. I've created a comprehensive market analysis document at `business-plan/market/01-market-analysis.md` covering:

**Market Overview**
- Industry defined as intersection of hobbyist mining hardware, self-hosted infrastructure, and crypto node/pool software
- TAM of $10M+ annually through 2030
- Key drivers: self-sovereignty movement, hardware democratization (Bitaxe), educational value

**Target Market Segmentation**
- Four personas identified: Sarah (Bitaxe Owner), Marcus (Home-Lab Enthusiast), Viktor (Sovereignty Maximalist), Alex (Educator)
