The funding strategy document has been created. Here's a summary of what was developed:

## Funding Strategy Complete

I've created a comprehensive funding strategy for MineBox at `business-plan/financial/03-funding-strategy.md` that includes:

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Total Raise**: $625K (range $500K-750K) at $2M pre-money valuation
- **Runway**: 35-42 months to breakeven (Month 40-42)
- **Founder Ownership Post-Seed**: 72.7%

**Use of Funds:**
| Category | Amount | % |
|----------|--------|---|
| Product Development | $275K | 44% |
| Sales & Marketing | $125K | 20% |
| Operations | $100K | 16% |
| Working Capital | $125K | 20% |

**Expected Returns (Probability-Weighted):**
- 4.8x MOIC for seed investors
- ~38% IRR over 5 years

**Exit Paths:**
- Strategic acquisition (40% probability): $10-25M
- Private equity roll-up (20%): $15-30M
- Lifestyle business (20%): Ongoing cash flow

The document is fully aligned with the revenue model ($3.1M ARR Year 5) and cost structure ($2.47M OpEx Year 5) from previous stages.
