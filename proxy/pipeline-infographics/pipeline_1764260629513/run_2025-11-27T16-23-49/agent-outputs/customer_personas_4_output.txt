I've created comprehensive customer personas for MineBox at `business-plan/market/02-customer-personas.md`. The document includes five detailed personas:

1. **Sarah Chen — The Bitaxe Owner** (Primary target): A technically inclined professional who bought a Bitaxe but is frustrated by the complexity of running her own mining infrastructure. High conversion likelihood, active in crypto communities.

2. **Marcus Webb — The Home-Lab Enthusiast**: An IT professional with an extensive self-hosted stack who wants to add mining as another well-integrated service. Values Docker deployment, APIs, and Prometheus metrics.

3. **Viktor Lindqvist — The Sovereignty Maximalist**: A privacy-focused Bitcoin maximalist who requires cryptographic verification of all claims. Will pay premium for verified sovereignty and will become a vocal advocate if standards are met.

4. **Alex Rivera — The Crypto Educator**: A content creator who needs reliable demo setups for tutorials. High-leverage persona for word-of-mouth—a successful tutorial could drive significant adoption.

5. **Chen Wei — The International Builder** (Added): A developer from a country with currency instability who sees crypto mining as both financial sovereignty and career opportunity. Important for global reach and open-source contributions.

Each persona includes:
- Demographics and technical proficiency
- Psychographics (values, pain points, goals)
- Behavioral patterns (discovery, research, triggers, barriers)
- Customer journey with touchpoints and friction points
- Representative quotes and day-in-the-life scenarios
- How MineBox fits into their life

The document concludes with a cross-persona analysis showing shared characteristics, key differentiators, and product development implications.
