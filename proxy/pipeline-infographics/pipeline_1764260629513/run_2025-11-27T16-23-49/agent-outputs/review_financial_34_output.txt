# MineBox Financial Model Review

## Overall Score: 7.5/10

---

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All three financial documents (revenue model, cost structure, funding strategy) are present and well-structured with detailed tables and projections.

2. **Clear Revenue Model Logic**: The open-core SaaS model with snapshot infrastructure is well-articulated. The tiered pricing (Free → $10 Starter → $25 Pro → Enterprise) aligns with the hobbyist mining persona research.

3. **Healthy Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC of 5:1+ and payback period <6 months are strong fundamentals. Gross margins of 75-80% are appropriate for SaaS.

4. **Honest About Path to Profitability**: The documents acknowledge that breakeven occurs at Month 36-54 depending on growth vs. capital-efficiency priorities—this is realistic, not artificially optimistic.

5. **Sensitivity Analysis Present**: All three scenarios (best, base, conservative) are documented with specific drivers and assumptions.

6. **Funding Strategy Alignment**: The $500K-$750K ask aligns with the cost structure analysis and runway requirements.

## Financial Red Flags

### 1. **Internal Inconsistency: Year 5 ARR Projections**
- **Revenue Model Executive Summary**: Claims Year 5 ARR of "$1.8M - $2.4M"
- **Revenue Model Base Case Table**: Shows Year 5 ARR of **$1,254,000** (significantly lower)
- **Funding Strategy**: References "Base Case Year 5 ARR: $1.25M" and "Upside Case Year 5 ARR: $2.4M"

**Issue**: The Executive Summary overstates base case by ~$550K. The $1.8M-$2.4M range should be labeled as "Best Case" or the base case table needs updating.

### 2. **Perpetual Operating Losses in 5-Year Projection**
- **Cost Structure Year 5**: Total OpEx $2.47M vs. Revenue $1.25M = 197% of revenue
- This means the model shows **losses continuing through Year 5** even in the base case

**Issue**: The "path to profitability" narrative is optimistic given that Year 5 expenses exceed revenue by ~$1.2M. Breakeven at Month 48-54 only works if you assume dramatic Year 6 revenue acceleration or cost cuts not modeled.

### 3. **Year 5 Sales Spend Anomaly**
- Sales & Marketing jumps to $597K in Year 5 (from $285K in Year 4)
- This is 48% of Year 5 revenue

**Issue**: At Year 5 ($1.25M ARR), spending $597K on S&M implies deliberate growth investment, but this contradicts the "path to profitability by Month 48-54" claim.

### 4. **Customer Acquisition vs. CAC Budget Mismatch**
- Year 1: 455 new paying customers with $22K marketing budget = ~$48/customer acquired
- But stated CAC is $75

**Issue**: Either the marketing budget is understated, CAC is overstated, or significant acquisition happens outside the marketing line item. Needs clarification.

### 5. **Churn Rate Optimism**
- Stated monthly churn: 3.5% blended (35% annual)
- LTV calculation uses this 3.5% for 28.5-month average lifetime

**Issue**: For a hobbyist product in a volatile crypto market, 3.5% monthly churn may be optimistic. Crypto bear markets historically cause significant hobbyist attrition. Conservative case should model 5-6% churn.

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Reconcile Year 5 ARR**: Update Revenue Model Executive Summary to match the base case table ($1.25M) or explain the discrepancy. Current statement of "$1.8M - $2.4M" is misleading.

2. **Clarify Profitability Timeline**: Either:
   - Reduce Year 5 cost projections to show actual breakeven, OR
   - Extend projections to Year 6-7 where true breakeven occurs, OR
   - Present an explicit "profitability-first" scenario with reduced headcount/marketing

3. **Validate CAC Calculation**: Show explicit CAC math: (Marketing Spend + Sales Spend) / New Customers Acquired. Current figures don't align.

4. **Add Churn Sensitivity**: Model a 5% monthly churn scenario and show impact on LTV (would drop to ~$340 from $490, significantly changing unit economics).

5. **Hardware Bundle Revenue Validation**: Hardware is 25% of Year 1 revenue ($33,600 / $115,200). At $200-400 per bundle with ~20% margin, this implies 170-420 units. Is this realistic for Year 1? Provide bottom-up calculation.

6. **Enterprise Customer Assumptions**: 5 Enterprise customers in Year 1 at $200/month = $12K/year. These represent 10% of Year 1 ARR. What's the acquisition strategy for Enterprise? This segment is underdeveloped.

7. **Infrastructure Cost Scaling**: Storage costs assume ~$0.02/GB but actual multi-coin full nodes with snapshots could be 2-3TB per coin. Validate the 500GB/coin assumption against actual Bitcoin, Litecoin Cash, etc. blockchain sizes.

## Verdict

**NEEDS_REVISION**

The financial model is structurally sound and demonstrates understanding of SaaS economics, but contains material inconsistencies that would raise investor concerns:

- The Executive Summary ARR figures don't match the projection tables
- The "path to profitability" narrative doesn't reconcile with the 5-year numbers showing Year 5 operating losses
- Several assumptions (churn, CAC, enterprise acquisition) need validation or better documentation

These are correctable issues. Once the inconsistencies are resolved and assumptions validated, this would be a credible investor-ready financial package.
