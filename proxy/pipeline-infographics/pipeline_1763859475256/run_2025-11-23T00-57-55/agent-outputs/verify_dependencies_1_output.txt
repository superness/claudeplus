Perfect! CoiniumServ is already built. Now let me summarize the dependency status:

## Dependency Status Summary

**Available:**
- ✅ Build tools (build-essential installed)
- ✅ APT package manager
- ✅ Internet connectivity
- ✅ CoiniumServ.exe already built (PE32/.NET assembly)
- ✅ User has sudo access (password required)

**Missing:**
- ❌ **Mono runtime** - Required to run CoiniumServ.exe (.NET assembly)
- ❌ **bitcoind** - Required for cryptocurrency daemon
- ❌ **bitcoin-cli** - Required for daemon interaction
- ❌ **CPU miner** (cpuminer-multi or cgminer) - Required for mining

**Critical Issue:**
While the user has sudo privileges, passwordless sudo is NOT available. This means any installation requiring `sudo apt-get install` or similar commands will require interactive password entry, which cannot be automated in this environment.

**What Can Be Done Without Sudo:**
- Generate configuration files for daemon/pool/miner
- Create directory structures
- Download source code for building from source (if user has write permissions)

**What Requires Sudo:**
- Installing mono runtime via apt
- Installing bitcoind via apt or snap
- Installing system dependencies for building miners from source

Since the core required software (mono, bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, miner software) are all missing and require sudo access with password for installation, the dependencies are NOT satisfied.
