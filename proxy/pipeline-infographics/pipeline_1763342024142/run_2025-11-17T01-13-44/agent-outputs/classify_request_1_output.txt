{
  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "The request explicitly states 'BUG FIX REQUIRED' and describes a critical broken functionality - the player ship is completely non-functional for movement. This is clearly a bug where existing functionality (ship movement in response to navigation targets/tap-to-move commands) is not working as intended. The user is not requesting a new feature or simple change, but rather fixing broken core gameplay mechanics.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "BUG FIX REQUIRED: The player ship is completely non-functional for movement. It does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands. This is a critical gameplay bug that prevents basic player interaction. Investigate the ship movement system, identify why the ship is not responding to navigation commands, and fix the issue so that the player can properly control their ship using tap-to-move or navigation targets.",
    "keyIndicators": [
      "BUG FIX REQUIRED",
      "completely non-functional",
      "does not respond",
      "critical gameplay bug",
      "prevents basic player interaction"
    ],
    "affectedArea": "ship movement system, navigation, input handling, mobile touch controls",
    "priority": "high",
    "severity": "critical - core gameplay broken",
    "components": [
      "Ship.js",
      "ShipPhysics.js",
      "InputManager.js",
      "MobileInputManager.js",
      "NavigationManager.js"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key indicators that confirm BUG_FIX classification:**
1. Explicit statement: "BUG FIX REQUIRED"
2. Describes broken functionality: "completely non-functional"
3. Existing feature not working: "does not respond to navigation targets"
4. Critical severity: "prevents basic player interaction"
5. Request to investigate and fix: "Investigate...identify why...fix the issue"

This is unambiguously a bug fix request for a critical gameplay-breaking issue.
