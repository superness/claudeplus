UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to analyze the SuperCoinServ cryptocurrency mining pool server project and design a comprehensive meta-pipeline system that orchestrates multiple specialized pipelines covering the full software lifecycle (development, testing, deployment, and monitoring workflows).

APPROACH: I will explore the codebase structure to understand the technology stack, existing build/deployment processes, dependencies, and architecture. Then I will design a multi-layered pipeline orchestration system with specialized sub-pipelines that can be triggered independently or as part of a coordinated workflow.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob tool to find project structure files (*.sln, *.csproj, package.json, Dockerfile, etc.)
2) Use Read tool to examine CoiniumServ.sln and key configuration files to understand the .NET project structure
3) Use Grep tool to search for existing CI/CD configurations (*.yml, *.yaml in .github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, azure-pipelines.yml, etc.)
4) Use Bash tool to check for build scripts (build.sh, build.ps1, Makefile, etc.)
5) Use Read tool to examine existing config files in build/bin/Debug/config/ to understand deployment configuration needs
6) Use Grep tool to search for test projects and frameworks (NUnit, xUnit, MSTest references)
7) Use Glob tool to find monitoring/logging infrastructure files
8) Design meta-pipeline architecture with:
   - Development pipeline (build, unit tests, code quality, static analysis)
   - Integration testing pipeline (integration tests, database tests, API tests)
   - Deployment pipeline (staging, production, rollback mechanisms)
   - Monitoring pipeline (health checks, metrics collection, alerting)
9) Create orchestration layer that manages dependencies between pipelines
10) Document pipeline triggers, environment variables, secrets management, and failure recovery strategies

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the pipeline design handles edge cases like: partial build failures, test timeout scenarios, deployment rollback requirements, concurrent pipeline executions, resource constraints
- Will ensure the design accommodates multiple deployment targets (different coin configurations visible in build/bin/Debug/config/coins/)
- Will plan for handling modified files in git status (many config files show as modified)
- Will design for both Windows and Linux environments (project is in WSL)

EVIDENCE:
- Project file structure analysis showing all components
- Existing build/test/deployment configurations found
- Technology stack inventory (.NET/C#, web components, JSON configs)
- Dependency map between different pipeline stages
- Detailed pipeline architecture diagram/specification
- Environment-specific configuration requirements
- Failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms

CONFIDENCE: Medium - This is a complex architectural design task requiring deep understanding of the existing codebase structure, build processes, and deployment requirements. The project appears to be a .NET-based cryptocurrency pool server with extensive configuration files. I can create a comprehensive pipeline design, but without running the actual builds or tests, some assumptions about dependencies and integration points may need validation during implementation.
