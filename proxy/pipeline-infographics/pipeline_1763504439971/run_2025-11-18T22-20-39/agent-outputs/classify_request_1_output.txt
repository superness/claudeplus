  "reasoning": "This request is clearly asking to ADD new functionality to the existing debug menu. Key indicators include 'added to the debug menu', 'This feature should', and the detailed specification of new behavior. While the debug menu exists, the 'Reset Player State' functionality is entirely new. This requires: (1) Creating a new debug menu option, (2) Implementing reset logic across multiple game systems, (3) Adding a confirmation dialog UI, (4) Coordinating state reset across ResourceManager, EconomyManager, SkillSystem, ShipFittingManager, NavigationManager, and other systems. This is not fixing something broken (BUG_FIX), not a simple 1-5 line change (QUICK_CHANGE), not restructuring existing code (REFACTOR), and not asking for information (QUESTION). It's a clear enhancement request to add new debug functionality.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The user wants a 'Reset Player State' option added to the debug menu. This feature should completely reset all player progress and state back to starting conditions, including: ship inventory, fitted modules, player location, skill points, currency, unlocked items, and any other persistent player data. The option should be clearly labeled in the debug menu (e.g., 'Reset Player State' or 'Start Over'), include a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resets, and fully reinitialize the player to the default starting state as if they were playing for the first time.",

**Analysis Summary:**

This is a **FEATURE_REQUEST** because:
- ✅ Adds NEW functionality (reset player state option)
- ✅ Requires new UI element (confirmation dialog)
- ✅ Requires new logic across multiple systems
- ✅ Enhancement to existing debug menu
- ✅ Not fixing broken behavior
- ✅ Not a simple parameter change
- ✅ Requires coordination across game managers

The request involves moderate complexity as it needs to:
1. Add new debug menu option
2. Implement comprehensive state reset logic
3. Create confirmation dialog UI
4. Reset multiple game systems (inventory, skills, economy, fitting, navigation)
5. Clear localStorage appropriately
6. Reinitialize player to default starting state
