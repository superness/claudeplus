Excellent! Let me analyze the infrastructure state:

## Current Infrastructure State Analysis

**✓ Daemon Status:**
- Bitcoin daemon processes running (PIDs 38018, 99793)
- RPC accessible and responding
- Chain: regtest mode ✓
- Block height: 332 (wallet should be funded)
- Config exists: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf ✓

**✗ Pool Status:**
- CoiniumServ process NOT running
- No Stratum port (3333) listening
- Pool config exists: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json ✓

**⚠ Dependencies:**
- bitcoind: installed ✓
- mono: installed ✓
- cpuminer: NOT found ✗

**✗ Miner Status:**
- Not configured yet (expected, since pool not running)

## Gap Identification

1. **Missing dependency**: cpuminer not installed
2. **Pool not running**: Despite daemon being operational
3. **Miner not configured**: Cannot proceed without pool
4. **No validation performed**: End-to-end cycle not verified

## Strategic Decision

The infrastructure is **partially complete**:
- Daemon is operational and healthy (already at block 332, fully funded)
- Configs exist for both daemon and pool
- Dependencies partially installed (missing cpuminer)

**However**, there's an anomaly: the daemon is running but **no ports are listening** (netstat showed no 18443 or 3333). This could indicate:
- Daemon RPC might be on a different port/interface
- Pool definitely not running (as confirmed by process check)

**Optimal path**: Since dependencies are mostly present but cpuminer is missing, and we need a complete infrastructure setup, I should start with a dependency check to ensure everything required is available before proceeding to pool setup.

## DECISION REASONING

**Current State:**
- Daemon: Running and RPC-accessible (block 332, regtest mode)
- Pool: Not running (process not found, no Stratum port)
- Dependencies: Partial (bitcoind ✓, mono ✓, cpuminer ✗)
- Configs: Exist for both daemon and pool

**Gaps Identified:**
1. cpuminer missing (required for miner setup phase)
2. Pool server not running (critical gap - blocks miner setup)
3. No validation performed yet

**Strategic Routing:**
Starting with dependency verification is the correct foundation move because:
- The user requested "complete SuperCoin mining infrastructure" with "miner setup"
- cpuminer is missing, which will block the miner setup phase later
- Better to catch and fix missing dependencies NOW before attempting pool/miner setup
- Dependency installer will verify all components and install cpuminer
- After dependencies are complete, can proceed directly to pool setup (skipping daemon, as it's already running)

**Dependency Chain:**
Dependencies → Pool Setup (daemon already running) → Miner Setup → Validation

This follows the principle of "check state first, delegate wisely, respect dependencies."
