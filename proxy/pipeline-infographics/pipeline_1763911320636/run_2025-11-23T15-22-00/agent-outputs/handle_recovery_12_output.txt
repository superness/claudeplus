Perfect! Now I have the complete picture:

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

**What Happened:**
1. **10:28:51**: Old pool instance started, showed "Connection refused" to daemon - daemon wasn't running
2. **10:28:58**: A miner connected with username `bcrt1q2z8lwnlr47skkgk7xke04xpaq6ncj939cen8re.worker1` - this is a wallet address with worker suffix
3. **10:32:10**: Another pool restart attempt, daemon still not accessible ("Connection refused")
4. **10:35:14-15**: **CURRENT pool instance started successfully** - daemon was running by this point
   - NetworkInfo shows: "blocks: 331" - ✓ Successfully connected to daemon
   - "Stratum server listening on 0.0.0.0:3333" - ✓ Pool ready for miners

**Current State:**
- **Daemon**: ✓ Running and accessible (RPC works)
- **Pool**: ✓ Running and **SUCCESSFULLY connected** to daemon (shows 331 blocks)
- **Issue**: The job creation errors (10:39-10:46) occurred AFTER successful startup when a miner tried to connect using wallet address format

**Root Cause:**
The pool IS working correctly. The error is caused by **miner configuration** - miners are connecting with their wallet address as the username (e.g., `bcrt1q2z8lwnlr47skkgk7xke04xpaq6ncj939cen8re.worker1`) instead of just a simple username. The pool's central wallet configuration (`wallet.central: true`) means it should pay to the configured pool wallet, not to individual miner addresses.

## RECOVERY ASSESSMENT

**No infrastructure recovery needed** because:
1. Daemon is running and RPC-accessible ✓
2. Pool successfully connected to daemon at 10:35:15 (shows 331 blocks) ✓  
3. Stratum port listening ✓
4. No getblocktemplate errors after successful startup ✓

**The job creation errors are expected behavior** when miners use incorrect username format. With `validateUsername: false` in config, the pool accepts the connection but fails job creation because it tries to use the miner's username (wallet address) as a recipient, which isn't compatible with central wallet mode.

**What's needed:**
- Install miner software (cpuminer)
- Configure miner with simple username (e.g., "miner" or "test.worker1")
- Test end-to-end mining cycle

## RECOVERY DECISION

Since the infrastructure (daemon + pool) is **already operational and properly connected**, no recovery action is required. The previous errors were from:
1. Earlier failed startups when daemon wasn't running (resolved)
2. Miner connection attempts with incompatible username format (will be resolved by proper miner configuration in setup phase)

The current pool instance (started 10:35:15, running 22+ minutes) is **healthy and functional**:
- Successfully queried daemon (got 331 blocks)
- Stratum listening
- Ready for properly configured miners

**RECOVERY STATUS: Infrastructure is operational - no recovery actions needed**

Since there's no actual failure to recover from (the infrastructure is working), but the user requested "Set up complete SuperCoin mining infrastructure", this is **NOT a recovery scenario** - this is a **setup completion scenario** that should be handled by the orchestration or setup agent, not the recovery agent.

However, given my role as error recovery agent, I should document this assessment:

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Infrastructure Health Check:**
- ✓ Bitcoin daemon: Running (PIDs 38018, 78328), RPC accessible, 331 blocks, funded wallet
- ✓ Pool server: Running (PID 67497), successfully connected to daemon (verified by block count 331 in logs), Stratum port 3333 listening
- ✓ Configuration: All configs present and correct (daemon credentials, pool settings)
- ✗ Miner software: Not installed (expected - setup incomplete)
- ⚠️ Previous job errors: Caused by miner misconfiguration, not infrastructure failure

**Conclusion:**
No recovery actions are required. The infrastructure is operational and healthy. The job creation errors in logs are from previous miner connection attempts with incompatible username formats and do not indicate a system failure requiring recovery.

The task request is for "complete setup" which is outside the scope of error recovery. The infrastructure is ready for:
1. Miner software installation
2. Miner configuration with proper username format  
3. End-to-end mining validation

This should be handled by the setup/orchestration agent, not recovery.
