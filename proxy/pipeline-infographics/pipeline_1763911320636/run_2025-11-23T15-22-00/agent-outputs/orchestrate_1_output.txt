## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

✓ **Dependencies**:
- Mono runtime: INSTALLED (required for CoiniumServ)
- CoiniumServ binary: EXISTS at /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe
- bitcoind: NOT INSTALLED (no `bitcoind` in PATH, but a bitcoind process is running)
- bitcoin-cli: NOT FOUND (command not available)

✓ **Configurations**:
- Daemon config: EXISTS at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with correct RPC settings (user: coiniumtest, port: 18443)
- Pool config: EXISTS at config/config.json (global config)
- Pool-specific config: EXISTS at config/pools/default.json (enabled: true, daemon connection configured)

⚠ **Running Components**:
- Daemon: RUNNING (pgrep found bitcoind regtest process)
- Pool: NOT RUNNING (CoiniumServ not in process list)
- RPC accessibility: CANNOT VERIFY (bitcoin-cli not found)

**Critical Observations**:
1. Daemon process is running, but `bitcoind` command not in PATH - suggests manual start or non-standard installation
2. Cannot verify daemon health without bitcoin-cli access
3. Pool config is ready but pool server is not running
4. Stratum port 3333 not detected in netstat (confirms pool not running)

**Infrastructure Gaps Identified**:
1. **bitcoind/bitcoin-cli binary location unknown** - need to find and verify
2. **Daemon health verification needed** - is it really operational or stuck?
3. **Pool server needs to be started** - CoiniumServ not running
4. **End-to-end validation pending** - no validation has been performed

**Dependency Chain Analysis**:
- Dependencies: Partial (Mono ✓, CoiniumServ binary ✓, bitcoind location unknown)
- Configs: Complete (daemon ✓, pool ✓)
- Daemon: Running but health unknown
- Pool: Not running (depends on healthy daemon)
- Miner: Not configured
- Validation: Not performed

## Strategic Decision

The daemon process is running but I cannot verify its health because `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-cli` are not in PATH. This is a critical blocker - I need to:

1. Locate the bitcoind installation
2. Verify the daemon is actually operational (RPC responding, blocks generated, wallet funded)
3. Only then proceed to pool setup

However, this is a **dependency verification issue** - the bitcoin binaries exist (process is running) but are not properly accessible. This could be:
- A PATH configuration issue
- A non-standard installation location
- A manual start without proper environment setup

Given that:
- A bitcoind process IS running (confirmed by pgrep)
- But bitcoin-cli is NOT accessible (command not found)
- This creates uncertainty about daemon health

The safest approach is to delegate to **daemon setup** agent, which will:
- Locate existing bitcoind installation
- Verify RPC is actually working
- Check block height and wallet funding status
- Either confirm daemon is ready OR restart it properly if it's in a bad state

This is more appropriate than dependency check because:
- The software IS installed (process running, Mono exists, CoiniumServ binary exists)
- We're not missing software, we're missing proper daemon initialization verification
- The daemon setup agent is designed to handle "daemon exists but health unknown" scenarios

DECISION: delegate_daemon_setup

REASONING:
Current infrastructure assessment reveals:
- Daemon process running (pgrep confirmed bitcoind regtest process exists)
- bitcoin-cli not accessible (command not found, cannot verify RPC health)
- Pool config exists and correctly points to daemon (RPC: 127.0.0.1:18443, user: coiniumtest)
- Pool server not running (needs healthy daemon first)

Critical gap: Daemon health is unknown. Process running ≠ operational daemon. Need to:
1. Locate bitcoind installation and verify RPC accessibility
2. Confirm block height and wallet funding (should have 101 blocks)
3. Validate daemon is actually serving RPC requests

Daemon is foundation component - pool depends on it. Cannot proceed to pool setup without confirming daemon is truly operational, not just running as a process. Delegating to bitcoin_daemon_manager to locate binaries, verify/establish daemon health, and prepare for pool connection.
