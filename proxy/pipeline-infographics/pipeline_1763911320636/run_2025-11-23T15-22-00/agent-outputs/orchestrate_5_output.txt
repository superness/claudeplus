## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current State Assessment**:

✅ **Daemon Status**: RUNNING and HEALTHY
- Process running (PID 38018, started 09:04)
- RPC accessible on port 18443 (verified via curl)
- Block height: 331
- Wallet: pool_wallet with 25 BTC confirmed balance
- Configuration: Correct (coiniumtest/testpass123)

✅ **Configurations**: EXIST and CORRECT
- Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with correct RPC settings
- Pool config: bitcoin.json with matching credentials and wallet address
- Pool main config: config.json with proper website/logging settings

✅ **Dependencies**: PARTIALLY INSTALLED
- bitcoind: INSTALLED and running
- Mono: INSTALLED (/usr/bin/mono)
- CoiniumServ binary: EXISTS at correct location
- bitcoin-cli: NOT in PATH (but not critical - daemon accessible via curl)
- cpuminer/minerd: NOT INSTALLED

❌ **Pool Status**: NOT RUNNING
- CoiniumServ process not running
- Stratum port 3333 not listening
- Pool never started or crashed

❌ **Miner Status**: NOT CONFIGURED
- No mining software (cpuminer/minerd) installed

**Critical Finding from Daemon Logs**:
Multiple "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt" errors detected, suggesting previous failed connection attempts (possibly from pool trying wrong credentials).

**Gap Analysis**:
1. ✅ Daemon operational and funded - COMPLETE
2. ❌ Pool server not running - NEEDS START
3. ❌ Miner not installed - NEEDS INSTALLATION

**Dependency Order**:
Since daemon is already running and healthy, we can skip daemon setup. However, I notice cpuminer is missing. The logical flow is:
- Pool depends on daemon (✅ daemon ready)
- Miner depends on pool (❌ pool not running)
- But we should verify/install miner software before starting pool

**Decision Reasoning**:
The infrastructure is partially set up with daemon running successfully. However, before starting the pool, we should ensure all dependencies (including mining software) are present. This follows the principle of verifying dependencies before attempting component setup.

Alternative consideration: We could start the pool first (since miner dependency doesn't block pool startup), but it's more robust to verify all software is installed before proceeding.
