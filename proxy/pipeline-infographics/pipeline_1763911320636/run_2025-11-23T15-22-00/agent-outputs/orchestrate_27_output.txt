## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current State Assessment:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✓ Installed
   - bitcoind: found at /usr/bin/bitcoind
   - CoiniumServ.exe: binary exists at /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/

2. **Configurations**: ✓ Exist
   - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf present
   - Pool config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json present

3. **Bitcoin Daemon**: ✓ Running and Healthy
   - Process running (PIDs: 38018, 103465)
   - RPC accessible and responding
   - Chain: regtest mode
   - Block height: 332
   - Wallet funded: 50 BTC confirmed balance + 2087.50 BTC immature
   - Status: Fully operational

4. **Pool Server**: ✗ Not Running
   - CoiniumServ process not detected
   - Stratum port 3333 not listening
   - Status: Needs setup

5. **Miner**: ⚠ Unknown Status
   - Configuration status unclear
   - Will need setup after pool is operational

**Identified Gaps:**
- Pool server is not running (primary gap)
- Miner configuration unknown (secondary gap)
- End-to-end validation not performed (final gap)

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Dependencies: Satisfied ✓
- Configs: Satisfied ✓
- Daemon: Satisfied ✓ (running, RPC working, wallet funded)
- Pool: NOT satisfied ✗ (next component to set up)
- Miner: Blocked by pool
- Validation: Blocked by pool + miner

**Strategic Decision:**
Skip dependency check and config generation since both are complete. Skip daemon setup since daemon is already running, healthy, and wallet is funded. Proceed directly to pool setup as the next required component in the dependency chain.
