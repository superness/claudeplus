Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the infrastructure state:

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

**Current State:**
1. **Bitcoin Daemon (bitcoind)**:
   - Status: ✓ RUNNING (PIDs: 38018, 78328)
   - RPC: ✓ ACCESSIBLE on port 18443
   - Config: ✓ EXISTS at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (correct credentials: coiniumtest/testpass123)
   - Blockchain: ✓ OPERATIONAL (331 blocks in regtest)
   - Wallet: ✓ FUNDED (blocks generated from startup logs)

2. **CoiniumServ Pool**:
   - Status: ✓ RUNNING (PID: 67497)
   - Stratum Port: ✓ LISTENING on port 3333 (0.0.0.0:3333)
   - Web Interface: ✓ LISTENING on port 8081
   - Pool Config: ✓ EXISTS at /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/bitcoin.json
   - Daemon Connection: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Pool started but showing old 401 Unauthorized errors from initial startup (Nov 18), current RPC test shows daemon is accessible with correct credentials
   - Job Manager: ⚠️ **ERRORS DETECTED** - "Invalid wallet address" errors when miners connect (address format issue with ".worker1" suffix)

3. **Dependencies**:
   - bitcoind: ✗ NOT IN PATH (but processes running, likely from custom install location)
   - Mono: ✓ INSTALLED (/usr/bin/mono)
   - CoiniumServ.exe: ✓ EXISTS
   - cpuminer: ✗ NOT INSTALLED

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - bitcoin.conf: ✓ EXISTS (correct RPC settings)
   - pool config.json: ✓ EXISTS (correct main config)
   - pool bitcoin.json: ✓ EXISTS (pool-specific config with wallet address)

**Issues Identified:**
1. Pool is experiencing job creation failures with "Invalid wallet address" errors when miners attempt to connect (address format issue)
2. cpuminer not installed (no miner available)
3. Pool logs show "Error recaching statistics" repeatedly (non-critical, but indicates missing implementation)
4. Pool may need restart to ensure fresh connection to daemon (old 401 errors from Nov 18 in logs)

**Gap Analysis:**
- Daemon: ✓ Complete and operational
- Pool: ⚠️ Running but has connection/job creation issues that need recovery
- Miner: ✗ Not installed (needs dependency installation)
- Validation: ✗ Not yet performed

**Next Action Decision:**
The infrastructure is partially set up but has quality issues that will prevent successful mining:
1. Pool is running but experiencing job creation failures
2. Miner software is missing
3. Need validation to verify end-to-end flow

Since the pool has active issues (job creation failures) and the old daemon connection logs suggest it may not be properly connected, I should delegate to recovery first to ensure pool is properly connected and functional, then proceed to miner setup.

## DECISION: delegate_recovery

**REASONING:**

Current infrastructure state assessment reveals the following:

**What exists:**
- Bitcoin daemon: RUNNING (2 processes, PIDs 38018/78328), RPC accessible on port 18443, 331 blocks in regtest, wallet funded
- Pool server: RUNNING (PID 67497), Stratum port 3333 listening, web interface on port 8081
- Configurations: All config files exist with correct settings (bitcoin.conf with RPC auth, pool configs)
- Dependencies: Mono installed, CoiniumServ.exe present

**Issues detected:**
1. **Pool job creation failures**: Logs show repeated "Invalid wallet address" errors when miners attempt to connect - pool cannot create mining jobs due to wallet address format issue (address + ".worker1" suffix not being parsed correctly)
2. **Old daemon connection errors**: Pool startup logs from Nov 18 show 401 Unauthorized errors, though current RPC test confirms credentials are correct - suggests pool may have stale connection state
3. **No miner software**: cpuminer not installed - blocking miner setup step
4. **Pool statistics errors**: Repeated "Error recaching statistics" (non-critical but indicates issues)

**Why recovery is needed:**
The pool server is running but functionally broken - it cannot create jobs for miners due to wallet address parsing errors. The presence of old 401 authentication errors suggests the pool may have started with incorrect credentials and needs to be restarted with fresh daemon connection state. Recovery agent should:
1. Restart pool with correct configuration to clear stale connection state
2. Verify daemon-pool RPC connection is working properly
3. Test job creation to ensure wallet address issue is resolved
4. Prepare clean state for miner setup

**Dependencies satisfied:**
- Daemon is operational and RPC-accessible (verified with curl test)
- Configuration files exist with correct settings
- Pool process exists but needs functional recovery

After recovery establishes healthy daemon-pool connection and resolves job creation issues, we can proceed to install miner dependencies and complete setup.
