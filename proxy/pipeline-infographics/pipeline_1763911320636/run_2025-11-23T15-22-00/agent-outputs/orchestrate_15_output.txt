## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

Based on comprehensive diagnostics, here's the current infrastructure state:

### ✅ **DAEMON: OPERATIONAL**
- **Process**: Running (PID 38018) with `-regtest -daemon`
- **RPC**: Accessible on 127.0.0.1:18443
- **Credentials**: coiniumtest/testpass123 ✓
- **Blockchain**: 331 blocks (regtest)
- **Wallet**: pool_wallet with 25 BTC balance ✓
- **Config**: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf exists and correct

### ⚠️ **POOL: RUNNING BUT WITH ERRORS**
- **Process**: Running (PID 67497) - mono CoiniumServ.exe
- **Stratum Port**: Listening on 0.0.0.0:3333 ✓
- **RPC Connection**: Connected to daemon ✓
- **Critical Issues**:
  1. **Job creation failing repeatedly**: "Invalid wallet address: bcrt1q2z8lwnlr47skkgk7xke04xpaq6ncj939cen8re.worker1"
     - Pool is appending ".worker1" to wallet address, making it invalid
     - This prevents job creation for miners
  2. **Statistics errors**: "Error recaching statistics; The method or operation is not implemented" (every 7 seconds)
     - Non-critical but indicates incomplete implementation
  3. **Web server failed**: Port 81 access denied (needs elevated privileges)
     - Non-critical for mining functionality

### ❌ **MINER: NOT CONFIGURED**
- No miner process detected
- Needs configuration with pool connection

### 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The pool is operational but **cannot create mining jobs** because:
- Pool config has wallet address: `bcrt1qu8l9f6kk6cmf6n50qyc8j40nvqdhsm5nk87s50`
- When a miner connects with username like "address.worker1", the pool incorrectly tries to use the full username as a wallet address
- CoiniumServ's wallet validation rejects "bcrt1q2z8lwnlr47skkgk7xke04xpaq6ncj939cen8re.worker1" as invalid

This is a **configuration issue** - the pool config needs adjustment to either:
1. Disable username validation (already set: `"validateUsername": false`)
2. Use a different wallet address format that CoiniumServ accepts
3. Fix the pool's username parsing logic

## DELEGATION DECISION

The infrastructure is **partially operational** but has a **critical pool configuration issue** preventing job creation. This requires recovery intervention to:
1. Fix the pool configuration to handle worker usernames correctly
2. Restart the pool with correct settings
3. Validate job creation works

I need to delegate to the error recovery agent to diagnose and fix the pool's job creation failure.

**REASONING:**

Current state assessment:
- ✅ Dependencies: Installed (bitcoind, mono, CoiniumServ)
- ✅ Daemon config: Exists and correct
- ✅ Daemon running: Process active, RPC accessible, wallet funded with 25 BTC, 331 blocks
- ✅ Pool config: Exists with daemon connection settings
- ⚠️ Pool running: Process active, Stratum port listening BUT job creation failing
- ❌ Miner: Not configured

**Gap identified**: Pool is running but **critically broken** - cannot create mining jobs due to wallet address validation errors when miners connect. The error pattern shows the pool is appending worker names to wallet addresses, creating invalid addresses like "bcrt1q...worker1".

**Why delegate_recovery**:
1. Pool process is running but functionally broken (job creation fails)
2. This is not a startup failure but a runtime configuration issue
3. The recovery agent specializes in diagnosing and fixing component failures
4. Need to either fix the config or restart with corrected settings
5. Cannot proceed to miner setup until pool can create jobs

**Dependencies**: Daemon is healthy and operational, so recovery can focus solely on the pool configuration issue.

DECISION: delegate_recovery
