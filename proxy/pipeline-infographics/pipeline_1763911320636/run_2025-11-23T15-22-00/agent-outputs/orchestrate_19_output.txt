## Infrastructure State Assessment Complete

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✅ **Daemon Status**: RUNNING
- Process: bitcoind -regtest -daemon (PID 38018)
- Block height: 332 (actively mining)
- RPC configured: port 18443, user: coiniumtest
- Wallet appears funded (seeing coinbase transactions in logs)
- Note: bitcoin-cli not in PATH but daemon is operational

✅ **Configurations**: EXIST
- Bitcoin config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (RPC settings correct)
- Pool main config: config.json (website, logging configured)
- Pool coin config: pools/default.json (daemon connection configured correctly)

✅ **CoiniumServ Binary**: EXIST
- Located at: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe

✅ **Mono Runtime**: INSTALLED
- Found at: /usr/bin/mono

❌ **Pool Server**: NOT RUNNING
- CoiniumServ process not detected
- Stratum port 3333 not listening

❌ **Dependencies Partial**: BITCOIN CLIENT TOOLS MISSING
- bitcoind binary running but not in PATH (likely custom installation)
- bitcoin-cli not found (needed for wallet operations)
- cpuminer not found (needed for mining)

⚠️ **Daemon Log Concerns**:
- Multiple "incorrect password attempt" errors detected
- Suggests previous connection attempts with wrong credentials
- Current config credentials: coiniumtest/testpass123

## Gaps Identified:

1. **Bitcoin client tools not accessible via PATH** - daemon running but CLI tools not available for wallet verification
2. **cpuminer not installed** - needed for actual mining
3. **Pool server not running** - main component missing
4. **Wallet funding uncertain** - cannot verify wallet balance without bitcoin-cli
5. **End-to-end validation not performed** - infrastructure incomplete

## Delegation Strategy:

Given the partial infrastructure state:
- Daemon is running (skip daemon setup initially)
- Configs exist and appear correct
- Missing: proper dependency verification, pool server launch, miner setup, validation

**First Action**: Need to verify dependencies are properly installed and accessible. While bitcoind is running, the fact that bitcoin-cli is not accessible suggests potential path issues or incomplete Bitcoin Core installation. Also need cpuminer for the complete mining cycle.

REASONING:
Starting infrastructure orchestration for SuperCoin mining setup. Current state analysis reveals:

**Already Complete:**
- Bitcoin daemon running in regtest mode (PID 38018, height 332)
- Configuration files exist with correct RPC settings (user: coiniumtest, port: 18443)
- CoiniumServ binary present
- Mono runtime installed

**Missing Components:**
- Bitcoin CLI tools not in PATH (bitcoin-cli needed for wallet verification)
- cpuminer not installed (required for mining)
- Pool server not running (CoiniumServ needs to be started)
- End-to-end validation not performed

**Initial Strategy:**
Although daemon is running, proper dependency verification is the foundation. The absence of bitcoin-cli in PATH suggests potential issues with Bitcoin Core installation completeness. Need to verify all required software is properly installed and accessible before proceeding with pool setup and miner configuration.

Dependencies are the prerequisite for all other components - must ensure bitcoin-cli is accessible for wallet operations and cpuminer is installed for mining functionality.
