## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment**:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - bitcoind: ✓ Running (PID 38018) but bitcoin-cli not in PATH
   - Mono runtime: ✓ Installed (v6.8.0.105)
   - CoiniumServ binary: ✓ Present at build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe
   - cpuminer: ✗ Not installed

2. **Configurations**:
   - bitcoin.conf: ✓ Exists with correct RPC settings (user: coiniumtest, port: 18443)
   - Pool config.json: ✓ Exists with proper structure
   - Pool default.json: ✓ Exists with daemon connection config matching bitcoin.conf
   - Wallet address configured: bcrt1qu8l9f6kk6cmf6n50qyc8j40nvqdhsm5nk87s50

3. **Running Components**:
   - Daemon: ✓ Running but RPC accessibility uncertain (bitcoin-cli not available, seeing incorrect password attempts in logs)
   - Pool: ✗ Not running
   - Miner: ✗ Not installed/configured

4. **Issues Detected**:
   - bitcoin-cli not in PATH (dependency gap)
   - Recent RPC authentication failures in daemon logs
   - No mining ports active (18443 RPC, 3333 Stratum)
   - cpuminer not installed (dependency gap)
   - Block height unknown (cannot verify wallet funding without RPC access)

**Gap Analysis**:

Primary gaps:
1. Missing bitcoin-cli for RPC communication verification
2. Missing cpuminer for mining operations  
3. Cannot verify daemon RPC is truly accessible (bitcoin-cli missing)
4. Cannot confirm wallet funding status
5. Pool not running
6. Miner not configured

**Decision Logic**:

The infrastructure has partial setup (daemon running, configs exist) but critical dependencies are missing:
- bitcoin-cli is essential for validating daemon health and wallet status
- cpuminer is required for the mining component

Without these dependencies, subsequent steps (daemon setup verification, pool setup, miner setup) cannot be properly validated or executed.

**Reasoning**:

Starting fresh infrastructure setup with intelligent gap-filling. While daemon appears to be running and configs exist, critical dependencies are missing:

1. **bitcoin-cli not found**: Essential for RPC communication validation - cannot verify daemon health, wallet funding, or block height without it
2. **cpuminer not installed**: Required for miner setup component
3. **RPC authentication failures detected**: Logs show incorrect password attempts, need to verify RPC is properly configured and accessible

Dependencies are foundational - must ensure all required software is installed and properly configured before proceeding with component setup. The dependency check will:
- Verify/install bitcoin-cli (part of Bitcoin Core package)
- Install cpuminer for mining operations
- Validate Mono runtime (already confirmed installed)
- Verify CoiniumServ binary (already confirmed present)

This ensures a solid foundation before moving to daemon verification and pool setup phases.
