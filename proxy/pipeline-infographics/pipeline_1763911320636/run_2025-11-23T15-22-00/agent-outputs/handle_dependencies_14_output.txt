## Dependency Installation Complete

All required dependencies for the SuperCoin mining infrastructure have been successfully installed and verified:

**Installed Components:**

1. **Mono Runtime v6.8.0.105** - Already installed, verified functional
2. **Bitcoin Core Daemon v25.0** - Located at `/home/super/bitcoin/bin/bitcoind` (currently running)
3. **Bitcoin CLI v27.0** - Located at `/home/super/bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-cli` (RPC communication tool)
4. **CPUMiner v2.5.1** - Built from source and installed to `/home/super/bin/minerd` with AVX2/XOP support
5. **CoiniumServ** - Pool server binary verified at `build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe`

**Key Actions Taken:**

- Located bitcoin-cli in `/home/super/bitcoin/bin/` (was not in PATH but existed)
- Cloned, compiled, and installed cpuminer from source with optimizations
- Verified all binaries are executable and functional
- Generated comprehensive dependency report

**Important Notes:**

- bitcoin-cli and minerd are not in system PATH - recommend adding `/home/super/bitcoin/bin` and `/home/super/bin` to PATH for convenience
- bitcoind is already running (PID 38018)
- All components tested and confirmed working

The infrastructure is now ready for the next phase: daemon setup verification, pool configuration, and miner orchestration.
