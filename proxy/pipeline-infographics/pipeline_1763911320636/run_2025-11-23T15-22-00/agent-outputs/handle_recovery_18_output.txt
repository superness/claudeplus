## RECOVERY OPERATION COMPLETE

**Failure Type**: Pool Address Validation Error  
**Recovery Strategy**: Configuration Fix + Graceful Restart

### Problem Diagnosed
The CoiniumServ pool was running but unable to create mining jobs due to wallet address validation failures. The pool config contained an old legacy address `mq6MnX6dShWqhrS6fo6Be7w2P9yaq6z9af` that didn't exist in the daemon's descriptor-based wallet.

### Recovery Actions Executed

1. **RPC Verification**: Confirmed daemon accessible with correct credentials (coiniumtest:testpass123)
2. **Address Generation**: Created new valid legacy address `n3tDGFLckRiyNnXuVj4Ss9bCNEF2mZyAcq`
3. **Address Validation**: Verified new address passes daemon's validateaddress RPC
4. **Configuration Update**: Modified pool config at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json`
5. **Pool Restart**: Gracefully stopped old pool process (PID 85922) and restarted with corrected config
6. **Connection Verification**: Confirmed Stratum listening on port 3333
7. **Job Creation Test**: Validated pool creating and broadcasting jobs
8. **End-to-End Test**: Generated test block, confirmed pool detected and rebroadcast work

### Infrastructure Status - OPERATIONAL ✓

**Bitcoin Daemon**:
- PID: 38018
- Block height: 332
- RPC: Accessible (port 18443)
- Wallet: 50 BTC confirmed, 2087.5 BTC immature

**CoiniumServ Pool**:
- PID: 88775 (new process after restart)
- Stratum: Listening on 0.0.0.0:3333
- Wallet address: n3tDGFLckRiyNnXuVj4Ss9bCNEF2mZyAcq (validated)
- Job creation: Working - "Broadcasted new job to 1 subscribers"
- Block detection: Working - responds to new blocks in network

**Miner**:
- PID: 86492
- Connection: ESTABLISHED to pool (127.0.0.1:3333)
- Receiving jobs: Yes
- Mining address: mkE94jx5HwUinUTiSCQvJNTSgFUSMAG5CW

### Recovery Metrics
- **Total time**: ~2 minutes
- **Attempts**: 1 (successful on first try)
- **Downtime**: <1 minute (graceful restart)
- **Components affected**: Pool only (daemon and miner unaffected)
- **Success rate**: 100%

### Verification Results
✓ No address validation errors in pool logs  
✓ Jobs broadcasting successfully every ~55 seconds  
✓ Pool detects new blocks and rebroadcasts work  
✓ Miner maintains stable connection  
✓ RPC calls between pool and daemon working  
✓ Full mining cycle validated end-to-end  

The SuperCoin mining infrastructure is now fully operational with intelligent error recovery completed. The pool can create valid mining jobs, the miner is receiving work, and all components are communicating properly.
