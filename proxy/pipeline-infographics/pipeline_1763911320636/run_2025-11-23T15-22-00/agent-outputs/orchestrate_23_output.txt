## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

✓ **Daemon Status**: RUNNING
- Process ID: 38018 (bitcoind -regtest -daemon)
- RPC Connection: WORKING (block height: 332)
- Configuration: EXISTS and properly configured
- RPC Credentials: coiniumtest:testpass123 on port 18443

✓ **Configurations**: EXIST
- Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf ✓
- Pool config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json ✓
- Pool-specific config: config/pools/default.json ✓ (Stratum port 3333, connected to daemon)

✓ **Software Components**:
- Mono runtime: INSTALLED (/usr/bin/mono)
- CoiniumServ.exe: EXISTS
- Bitcoin daemon: RUNNING

✗ **Missing Components**:
- bitcoin-cli: NOT FOUND (CLI tools not installed, though daemon is running)
- Pool server: NOT RUNNING
- cpuminer: NOT FOUND (miner software not installed)

✗ **Gaps Identified**:
1. Bitcoin CLI tools missing (needed for wallet operations)
2. Wallet funding status unknown (cannot verify without bitcoin-cli)
3. Pool server not running
4. Miner software not installed

## Decision Reasoning

The infrastructure is **partially operational**:
- The Bitcoin daemon is already running in regtest mode with proper RPC configuration
- Configuration files are properly set up for both daemon and pool
- Mono runtime is available to run CoiniumServ

However, there are **critical missing dependencies**:
- bitcoin-cli is missing (cannot verify wallet funding or perform wallet operations)
- cpuminer is not installed (needed for mining)

Since we need bitcoin-cli to:
1. Verify if the wallet has been funded with the initial 101 blocks
2. Create mining wallet addresses if needed
3. Perform wallet operations for the pool

And we need cpuminer to actually mine, the next logical step is to **verify and install missing dependencies** before proceeding with pool setup.

Even though the daemon is running, we cannot validate its wallet state or proceed confidently without the CLI tools. The dependency check agent should:
1. Install bitcoin-cli (Bitcoin Core client tools)
2. Install cpuminer or equivalent mining software
3. Verify Mono runtime (already installed, but good to confirm)
4. Verify CoiniumServ availability (already present)

After dependencies are installed, we can verify wallet funding, then proceed to pool setup, miner configuration, and finally end-to-end validation.
