Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now provide a structured bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship does not respond to any navigation targets or tap-to-move commands - ship remains stationary despite navigation commands being set",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player double-taps/double-clicks on a location or object, the ship should calculate thrust vector toward that target and begin moving at the specified speed (default 75% on approach). W/S keys should control speed percentage, while navigation system controls direction.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains completely stationary with no movement despite navigation commands being set. Navigation targets appear to be detected and processed by InputManager (logs show navigation command state), but the ship's physics engine receives no thrust input or the thrust magnitude is being lost/corrupted somewhere in the data flow pipeline.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "Navigation target system (InputManager.js)",
    "Ship physics update pipeline (Ship.js)",
    "Physics thrust processing (ShipPhysics.js)",
    "Input command propagation (SpaceshipSimulator.js main loop)"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to fully initialize and load player ship",
    "Step 3: Double-click or double-tap on any empty space location in the game canvas",
    "Step 4: Observe that navigation notification appears (\"Approaching coordinates: X, Y, Z\")",
    "Step 5: Observe ship HUD - ship velocity should increase but remains at 0 m/s",
    "Step 6: Check browser console logs - navigation command shows active target and speedSetting > 0",
    "Step 7: Observe ship position - ship does not move at all despite active navigation",
    "Step 8: Alternative test: Press W key repeatedly to increase manual thrust to 100%",
    "Step 9: Observe ship still does not move even with manual thrust commands"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js:1730-1767 (main update loop - calls updateWithMiningAndExploration)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js:195-376 (updateWithNavigation method - processes navigation commands and calculates thrust)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js:380-486 (calculateThrustFromNavigation - converts navigation to thrust vector)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js:69-113 (updatePhysics - receives thrust vector and updates velocity/position)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js:117-149 (updateTargetVelocity - processes thrustInput.magnitude)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js:675-687 (getNavigationCommand - returns navigation state)",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js:692-713 (setNavigationTarget - sets navigation command with speedSetting)"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Based on the extensive debug logging in the code, the most likely root cause is that thrustVector.magnitude is being lost or corrupted during object spreading/passing between methods. The code shows multiple BUGFIX comments specifically addressing 'magnitude field preservation' issues (Ship.js:350-356, ShipPhysics.js:71-77). The navigation command appears to be set correctly with speedSetting=0.75, but when the thrustVector is passed from Ship.updateWithNavigation() → ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() → ShipPhysics.updateTargetVelocity(), the magnitude property may not survive the object spread operations or may be getting nullified. Key evidence: ShipPhysics.js line 126 shows 'magnitude = this.thrustInput.magnitude || 0' which suggests magnitude can be undefined/null, and line 120-124 has a safety check that warns if thrustInput is null. The ship literally cannot move if thrustInput.magnitude evaluates to 0, even if the direction vector (x,y,z) is set correctly."
