I'll analyze this bug report about the afterburner physics issue that persists despite the previous fix attempt.

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Afterburner module causes instant ship movement instead of EVE-style acceleration curves - previous velocity object fix ineffective",
  "expectedBehavior": "When afterburner is fitted, ship should maintain EVE-style physics with smooth acceleration curves (V(t) = V_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ))), orientation-based thrust direction, and gradual velocity changes based on agility and mass",
  "actualBehavior": "When afterburner is fitted: (1) Ship instantly changes direction ignoring current orientation, (2) Throttle changes instantly affect speed with no acceleration curve, (3) EVE-style physics completely bypassed",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "physics",

    "afterburner_module",
    "acceleration_system"
  ],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)",
    "Step 2: Open Ship Fitting UI (F key or click fitting button)",
    "Step 3: Fit an afterburner module to the ship (any afterburner type)",
    "Step 4: Close fitting UI and activate afterburner module",
    "Step 5: Press W key to increase throttle",
    "Step 6: Observe: Ship speed changes INSTANTLY instead of following acceleration curve",
    "Step 7: Press A or D key to change direction",
    "Step 8: Observe: Ship direction changes INSTANTLY ignoring ship orientation",
    "Step 9: Compare to behavior WITHOUT afterburner fitted (should show smooth acceleration)",
    "Step 10: Check browser console for any physics calculation errors"
  ],

  "hypothesis": "The previous fix changed velocity from THREE.Vector3 to plain object, but this likely only addressed a symptom, not the root cause. The real issue is probably: (1) Afterburner activation bypasses the EVE physics update loop entirely, OR (2) Afterburner applies velocity changes directly instead of through acceleration calculations, OR (3) Afterburner speed bonus is being applied to current velocity instead of max velocity in the exponential formula, OR (4) The ship's update method has conditional logic that skips physics calculations when afterburner is active. Need to trace the complete code path from afterburner activation → velocity calculation → ship position update to find where EVE-style physics is being circumvented.",
  "additionalContext": {
    "previousFixAttempt": "Changed velocity from THREE.Vector3 to plain object in ShipPhysics.js",
    "whyPreviousFixFailed": "Likely addressed data structure issue but not the actual physics bypass logic",
    "keyPhysicsFormula": "V(t) = V_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ)) where τ is agility-based time constant",
    "testingRequired": [
      "Verify bug exists with afterburner fitted",
      "Verify normal physics works without afterburner",
      "Test fix restores acceleration curves with afterburner",
      "Test orientation-based thrust is respected",
      "Validate exponential acceleration formula is applied"
    ]
  }
}
```
