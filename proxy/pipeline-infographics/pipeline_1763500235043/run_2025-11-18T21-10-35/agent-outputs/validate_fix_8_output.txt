No new evidence files were created, meaning the test didn't complete. The issue is that the test requires the HTTP server to be running. Let me check the implementation stage output to see what their validation approach was:

Based on my analysis of the evidence:

## VALIDATION ANALYSIS

### 1. Fix Review

**Original Bug**: Afterburner causes instant speed changes instead of EVE-style smooth acceleration curves.

**Previous Fix Attempt (Failed)**: Changed velocity from `THREE.Vector3` to plain object in `ShipPhysics.js` - This did NOT resolve the issue.

**Current Fix (Implemented)**: Modified `Ship.js` line 91-114 to preserve current velocity when `maxVelocity` changes due to afterburner fitting/unfitting. The fix:
- Detects when `maxVelocity` changes (e.g., 350 → 525 m/s when afterburner fitted)
- Preserves current velocity value (doesn't reset to zero or max)
- Allows physics system to naturally accelerate from current speed to new max through exponential curves
- Prevents instant velocity jumps

### 2. Post-Fix Evidence Analysis

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: No post-fix validation evidence exists. The evidence files I found are all from BEFORE the current fix was implemented:

- `bug_evidence_afterburner_physics_1763500451964.json` (Nov 18 16:14) - **BEFORE fix** (shows instant 525 m/s jump)
- `afterburner_fix_summary.json` (Nov 18 16:21) - **Fix summary** (describes what SHOULD happen)
- Current Ship.js has uncommitted changes with the velocity preservation fix

**The validation test was NOT run after the fix was applied.**

### 3. Before vs After Comparison

**BEFORE FIX** (from evidence file):
- Phase 1 (no afterburner): Speed at 1s = 80.40 m/s, Speed at 3s = 142.43 m/s ✅ (normal curve)
- Phase 2 (with afterburner): Speed at 0.5s = **525 m/s** ❌ (INSTANT!)
- Deceleration: 525 → 0 m/s in 0.5s ❌ (INSTANT!)

**AFTER FIX** (expected behavior per fix documentation):
- Should maintain current speed when afterburner fitted
- Should smoothly accelerate from current speed to new max over ~7-21 seconds
- No instant velocity jumps (< 50 m/s per frame)

**ACTUAL AFTER FIX** (validation evidence): **MISSING** - No validation run detected

### 4. Regression Check

**Cannot perform regression check** - No post-fix evidence exists to analyze for:
- New errors introduced
- Broken WebSocket commands  
- Other system impacts

### 5. Confidence Assessment

```json
{
  "validation": "FIX_INCOMPLETE",
  "bugResolved": "UNKNOWN - NOT TESTED",
  "beforeAfterComparison": {
    "before": "Instant acceleration to 525 m/s in 0.5s when afterburner fitted",
    "after": "NO POST-FIX EVIDENCE - Validation test not executed",
    "match": "CANNOT_DETERMINE"
  },
  "regressionCheck": {
    "newErrors": "UNKNOWN - No evidence file",
    "brokenCommands": "UNKNOWN - No evidence file",
    "status": "VALIDATION_NOT_RUN"
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reason": "Fix was implemented in Ship.js (lines 91-114) but validation test was never executed after the fix. The only evidence files are from BEFORE the fix was applied, showing the bug still exists in that earlier state. User reports bug still exists, suggesting fix may not be working, but without post-fix validation evidence, cannot confirm."
}
```

## Conclusion

The fix validator **CANNOT verify the fix** because:
1. ❌ No post-fix validation test was executed
2. ❌ All evidence files are from BEFORE the current fix
3. ❌ User reports bug still exists despite fix being implemented
4. ❌ The fix is uncommitted code changes (not deployed)

**The user's report that "the fix didn't work" appears accurate** - the current fix in Ship.js is uncommitted and likely was never actually tested in the browser. The previous fix (Vector3 → plain object) was tested and confirmed to fail.

**DECISION: FIX_INCOMPLETE**
