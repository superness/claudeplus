## Summary

I've successfully identified and fixed the **real root cause** of the afterburner physics bug. Here's what I found:

### The Bug

When an afterburner was fitted, ships would instantly jump to max velocity (525 m/s) in 0.5 seconds instead of following the smooth EVE-style exponential acceleration curve.

### Root Cause

The bug was in **ContentManager.js** ship definitions:
- Atron had `agility: 3.2` (should be 3,840,000)
- Condor had `agility: 2.8` (should be 2,940,000)

These values were the `inertiaModifier` instead of the calculated `agility = mass × inertiaModifier`.

### Why This Caused Instant Acceleration

In EVE physics, the acceleration time constant is calculated as:
```
τ = agility / 500,000
```

**With the bug:**
- τ = 3.2 / 500,000 = 0.0000064 seconds (microscopic!)
- Ships reached max velocity in a single frame

**After the fix:**
- τ = 3,840,000 / 500,000 = 7.68 seconds (correct!)
- Ships follow proper exponential curves

### The Fix

I corrected the agility values in `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ContentManager.js`:

1. **Atron**: Changed `agility: 3.2` → `agility: 3840000`
2. **Condor**: Changed `agility: 2.8` → `agility: 2940000`

### Verification

Created and ran `verify_afterburner_fix.js` which confirms:
- ✅ Atron time constant: 7.680s (correct)
- ✅ Condor time constant: 5.880s (correct)
- ✅ With afterburner fitted: 6.912s (still correct)
- ✅ Expected acceleration at 0.5s: 36.6 m/s (NOT 525 m/s instant!)

### Expected Behavior Now

With the fix, when an afterburner is fitted:
- **0.5s**: 37 m/s (7% of max) instead of instant 525 m/s
- **1.0s**: 71 m/s (14% of max)
- **5.0s**: 270 m/s (51% of max)
- **10.0s**: 402 m/s (77% of max)

This matches authentic EVE Online physics with smooth exponential acceleration curves.
