Now I've identified the **ROOT CAUSE**! Let me create the root cause analysis JSON:

```json
{
  "rootCause": "When an afterburner is fitted, syncStatsFromFitting() changes maxVelocity (350 → 525 m/s), which causes updateTargetVelocity() to instantly recalculate targetVelocity to the new max speed. Since the ship already has current velocity near the old max (350 m/s), and the new targetVelocity jumps to 525 m/s, the exponential acceleration formula in applyExponentialAcceleration() sees a huge velocity difference and rapidly accelerates the ship to the new target speed, creating the appearance of instant movement. The previous fix changed velocity data structure but didn't address the core issue: targetVelocity recalculation when maxVelocity changes mid-flight.",

    "Ship rapidly accelerates to new target, appearing instant",
    "Same issue on deceleration: targetVelocity drops instantly when afterburner unfitted"
  ],
  
  "whyItHappens": "The EVE physics system is designed to smoothly accelerate toward a targetVelocity using exponential curves. However, when maxVelocity changes mid-flight (due to fitting an afterburner), the targetVelocity is instantly recalculated to the new max speed. This creates a large velocity gap that the exponential formula tries to close rapidly, making movement appear instant. The issue is compounded because the ship may already be moving at the old max speed (350 m/s), and when targetVelocity jumps to 525 m/s, the acceleration curve kicks in aggressively to reach the new target.",
  
  "whyPreviousFixFailed": "The previous fix changed velocity from THREE.Vector3 to a plain object { x, y, z }. This addressed potential reference issues with Vector3 internal state, but did NOT fix the actual physics problem: targetVelocity recalculation when maxVelocity changes. The instant movement behavior is caused by the physics logic, not the data structure.",
  
  "proposedFix": "When syncStatsFromFitting() changes maxVelocity, preserve the current velocity ratio instead of letting targetVelocity jump. For example: if ship is moving at 350 m/s (100% of old max), and maxVelocity increases to 525, the current velocity should remain 350 m/s and only gradually accelerate to 525 m/s through normal physics. The fix should either: (1) Scale current velocity proportionally: newVel = (currentVel / oldMax) * newMax, OR (2) Preserve absolute velocity: keep currentVel at 350 and let physics naturally accelerate to new max, OR (3) Add smooth transition: gradually interpolate maxVelocity over 1-2 seconds instead of instant change."
