## Execution Report

**Reproduction Test Execution: COMPLETED**

### Environment Setup ✓
- HTTP server started with caching disabled (`-c-1` flag)
- Old Chrome processes killed
- Working directory: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships`

### Test Execution ✓
- **Script**: `test_afterburner_bug_verification.js`
- **Status**: Executed successfully (23 commands completed)
- **Evidence File**: `bug_evidence_afterburner_physics_1763500451964.json`
- **Console Logs**: Captured (5 errors, 0 exceptions)

### Critical Findings: BUG REPRODUCED ✓

#### Phase 1: Without Afterburner (Normal Physics) ✅
- Speed at 1s: **80.40 m/s**
- Speed at 3s: **142.43 m/s**
- Behavior: **Normal EVE-style exponential acceleration curve**

#### Phase 2: With Afterburner Fitted ❌ BUG CONFIRMED
- Speed at 0.5s: **525 m/s** (INSTANT!)
- Speed at 1.5s: **525 m/s** (no change)
- Behavior: **INSTANT ACCELERATION TO MAX SPEED**
- Deceleration: **INSTANT (525 → 0 m/s in 0.5s)**

### Bug Analysis

**Previous Fix Attempt**: Changed velocity from `THREE.Vector3` to plain object
**Result**: **INEFFECTIVE** - Bug still present

**Root Cause**: The previous fix changed the data structure but did not address the core physics logic. When an afterburner is fitted:
1. `maxVelocity` changes from ~150 m/s to ~525 m/s
2. The system recalculates `targetVelocity` instantly
3. Ship velocity jumps to match the new target
4. Exponential acceleration curve is bypassed

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Ship should maintain current speed when afterburner fitted
- Should smoothly accelerate to new max over 7-21 seconds (exponential curve)
- Should smoothly decelerate when throttle reduced

**Actual Behavior**:
- Ship instantly jumps to 525 m/s (0.5s response time)
- No acceleration curve observed
- Instant deceleration to 0 m/s

### Conclusion

The bug has been **conclusively reproduced**. The evidence shows:
- ✅ Normal physics working WITHOUT afterburner (exponential curve)
- ❌ Instant movement WITH afterburner (physics bypass)
- ❌ Previous fix did NOT resolve the issue

**Next Steps**: The implementation stage should investigate `Ship.syncStatsFromFitting()` and the velocity/targetVelocity calculation logic to preserve current velocity when maxVelocity changes.
