Now I have a complete understanding of the game structure. This is an American Checkers game where the player (Red) plays against an AI (Black). Let me analyze the bug.

## Bug Analysis

**Bug Summary**: AI takes control of both players (Red and Black) for multiple consecutive turns after human makes first move

**Expected Behavior**: After the human player (Red) makes one move, the AI (Black) should make one move, then control should return to the human player (Red) for their next turn. The turn alternation should be: Red (human) → Black (AI) → Red (human) → Black (AI), etc.

**Actual Behavior**: After the human makes 1 move as Red, the AI controls both Black AND Red for several turns instantly before returning control to the human player.

**Affected Systems**: Turn System, AI System, Input System

**Severity**: HIGH - This fundamentally breaks core gameplay by taking away player control

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a new game of American Checkers
2. Make one move as the Red player (drag and drop a piece)
3. Observe that the AI makes a move for Black (expected)
4. Observe that the AI ALSO makes moves for Red (unexpected) for several turns
5. Eventually, control returns to the human player

**Likely Source Files**: 
- `client/game.js` (lines 1100-1297: GameController class, specifically `executeMove`, `scheduleAIMove`, and `executeAIMove` methods)

**Initial Hypothesis**: 

The bug is in the `executeAIMove` method (lines 1237-1297). After the AI completes its turn, it calls `this.turnSystem.endTurn()` at line 1293, which switches `currentPlayer` back to `'red'`. However, there's a critical flaw:

1. When `executeAIMove` completes (non-multi-jump), it calls `this.turnSystem.endTurn()` at line 1293
2. This changes `currentPlayer` to `'red'`
3. But the method does NOT check if the current player is human after ending the turn
4. If some condition causes the AI logic to run again (possibly through UI update callbacks or timing issues), the AI could execute moves for Red

The more likely issue is in how the game state is being checked or there could be a recursive call happening. Looking at:
- Line 1211-1213: After human move, if AI is enabled AND it's black's turn, `scheduleAIMove()` is called
- Line 1286-1296: After AI multi-jump, when the jump chain ends, `endTurn()` is called but there's no check to prevent further AI execution

The root cause appears to be that `aiThinking` flag management combined with the `setTimeout` callbacks may cause race conditions where the AI continues to play even when it's Red's turn. The issue might also be in `updateUI()` or somewhere that inadvertently triggers another AI move cycle.

Another possibility: After `executeAIMove` calls `endTurn()` and sets `aiThinking = false`, if `updateUI()` somehow triggers game logic again, or if there's a rendering loop that evaluates game state incorrectly, it could cause the AI to move again.
