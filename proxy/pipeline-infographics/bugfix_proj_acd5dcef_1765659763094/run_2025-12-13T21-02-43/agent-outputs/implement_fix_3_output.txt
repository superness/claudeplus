The fix has been implemented.

**Changes Made**:

File: `client/game.js`
- Added a guard check at line 1238-1243 at the beginning of `executeAIMove()` method
- The guard verifies `this.turnSystem.currentPlayer === 'black'` before allowing AI execution
- If it's not black's turn, the method resets `aiThinking` to false and returns early

**Why This Fixes It**:

The bug was caused by a race condition where stale `setTimeout` callbacks from `scheduleAIMove()` could fire after the turn had already switched back to red. Without the guard, `executeAIMove()` would execute moves for black pieces even when `turnSystem.currentPlayer` was 'red', causing the AI to control both players.

The fix ensures that even if multiple or stale setTimeout callbacks fire, the AI will only execute moves when it's actually black's turn in the turn system.

**Testing Suggestion**:

1. Start a new game as red
2. Make a single move
3. Wait for AI (black) to make its move
4. Verify control returns to you (red) for your next move
5. Repeat several turns to confirm the turn alternation works correctly
6. Test with capturing moves that could trigger multi-jumps
