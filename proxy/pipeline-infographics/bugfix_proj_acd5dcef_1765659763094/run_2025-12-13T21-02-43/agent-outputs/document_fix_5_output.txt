I can now see the fix that was applied. Let me document this properly.

---

**Bug Fix Summary**:

**Bug**: AI controls both Black and Red pieces for several consecutive turns after human makes first move

**Root Cause**: Race condition in `executeAIMove()` - stale `setTimeout` callbacks from `scheduleAIMove()` could fire after the turn had already switched back to red, causing the AI to execute moves when it wasn't the AI's turn. The method lacked a guard to verify the current player before proceeding.

**Fix**: Added a guard check at the beginning of `executeAIMove()` (lines 1238-1243) that verifies `this.turnSystem.currentPlayer === 'black'` before allowing any AI move execution. If not black's turn, it resets `aiThinking` to false and returns early.

**Files Modified**:
- `client/game.js`: Added guard clause at lines 1238-1243 in `executeAIMove()` method to prevent AI execution when it's not black's turn

**Impact**:
- No side effects - the fix only prevents invalid execution, normal gameplay unchanged
- Multi-jump sequences still work correctly since `currentPlayer` remains 'black' throughout the AI's multi-jump until `endTurn()` is called
- Human player moves are unaffected as this code only runs in the AI execution path

**Testing Notes**:
1. Start a new game of American Checkers
2. Make a move as Red (human player)
3. Observe AI makes exactly ONE move as Black
4. Verify control returns to human player (Red)
5. Repeat turns to confirm proper alternation: Red → Black → Red → Black
6. Test multi-jump scenarios to ensure AI can complete full jump chains

**Comments Added**:
- `client/game.js:1238-1240`: Guard comment explaining the fix prevents stale setTimeout callbacks from executing AI moves during red's turn
