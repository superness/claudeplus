### Visual Validation

#### Screenshot: 01-initial-scene.png
**What I See:**

- [x] Enemy health bar reduced - PASS (enemy took damage)
- [ ] Skill cooldown visible on skill bar - UNCLEAR (first skill slot appears same color)

#### Failed Test Screenshots Analysis

**Companion AI Test (test-failed-1.png):**
- Shows player at 0/735 health (DEAD)
- Companions still visible with health bars
- Enemy still present
- Tests timed out waiting for companion AI behavior

**Enemy Attacking Player Test (test-failed-1.png):**
- Player at 254/735 health
- Enemy present but appears not attacking
- Scene looks normal but test timed out

**Death and Loot Test (test-failed-1.png):**
- Shows combat log with "Looted 7 Thrones" and "Looted 2x Cloth Scraps" - **LOOT SYSTEM WORKS!**
- Loot pickup text appearing in combat log
- Scene shows loot drops occurred even though test timed out

### Visual Issues Found

1. **No Floating Damage Numbers** - Damage numbers are not visibly floating up when damage is dealt. This is a critical combat feedback missing.

2. **Dark Scene/Lighting** - The terrain and environment are very dark. While characters are visible, the overall scene lacks proper illumination for a polished look.

3. **Placeholder Character Models** - All characters (player, companions, enemies) use simple geometric shapes rather than actual Warhammer 40K models. Player is a golden sphere/humanoid, companions are red figures, enemies are purple.

4. **No Visible Terrain Detail** - Ground is a flat dark surface with no texture detail, structures, or environmental objects.

5. **Skill Effects Subtle** - Skill visual effects are minimal - just slight glows rather than dramatic 40K-style effects (bolter fire, plasma bursts, etc.)

6. **No Target Frame UI** - When selecting an enemy, there's no dedicated target info panel showing enemy name, health, type, etc.

7. **Test Timeouts** - Several tests involving AI behavior (companion AI, enemy AI attacking) timed out, suggesting these systems may not be triggering reliably.

### Summary
- **Functional Tests**: 11/12 passed (92%)
- **Visual Validation Tests**: 4/8 passed (50%)
- **Visual Checks**: 
  - Initial Scene: 6/7 passed
  - UI Elements: 5/6 passed
  - Combat: 3/3 passed
  - Targeting: 2/3 passed
  - Skill Effects: 1/3 passed
  - Damage Numbers: 1/4 passed

### Critical Visual Issues
1. **Floating damage numbers not visible** - Essential combat feedback missing
2. **Test timeouts for AI-driven tests** - Companion AI and Enemy AI tests failing
3. **Placeholder models** - No actual character models yet
4. **Dark environment** - Lighting needs improvement

The core combat systems work (damage is dealt, loot drops, health updates) but visual feedback (especially floating damage numbers) and AI behavior triggering need fixes.
