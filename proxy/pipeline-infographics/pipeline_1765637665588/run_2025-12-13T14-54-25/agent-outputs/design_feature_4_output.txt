I've created a comprehensive **Visual Combat Design Document** that fills in the missing specifications from the existing design docs. Here's a summary of the design decisions I made:

## Design Decisions Summary

### 1. **Art Style Decision: Stylized Mid-Poly (GW1-inspired)**
- Not hyper-realistic (performance + readability)
- Not cartoon (maintain grimdark 40K tone)
- Clear silhouettes recognizable at all zoom levels
- Player models: 15,000-25,000 triangles
- Common enemies: 3,000-6,000 triangles

### 2. **Death Animation Approach: Damage-Type Specific**
- Kinetic: Ragdoll knockback
- Piercing: Clutch wound + collapse with blood pool
- Explosive: Ragdoll launch + debris particles
- Thermal: Burn while falling (2 seconds)
- Electric: Convulse + lightning crackle
- Warp: Reality tear + dissolution
- Boss deaths: Multi-phase dramatic sequences (3-5 seconds)

### 3. **Enemy Threat Color System (matching existing docs)**
- Minoris (WHITE): 80-150 HP - cannon fodder
- Majoris (BLUE): 180-350 HP - standard troops
- Extremis (YELLOW): 400-800 HP - elites
- Terminus (PURPLE): 2,000-8,000 HP - bosses
- Apex (GOLD): 8,000-20,000+ HP - world/raid bosses

### 4. **Faction Color Palettes**
- Imperial: Gold/White/Crimson/Steel Blue
- Tau: Cyan/White/Orange/Dark Blue
- Ork: Green/Red/Yellow/Brown

### 5. **Audio Design**
- Faction-specific weapon sounds and voice lines
- Dynamic music system (exploration → combat → boss)
- Imperial: Orchestral/Gothic; Tau: Electronic/Alien; Ork: Heavy metal/Chaos

### 6. **Terrain/Lighting Specifications**
- Zone types per faction with distinct lighting
- Weather system (rain, dust storm, warp storm)
- Decal system for blood/scorch marks with fade timers

The document integrates with all existing systems (combat mechanics, damage types, enemy tiers) while providing the missing visual specifications needed for client implementation.
