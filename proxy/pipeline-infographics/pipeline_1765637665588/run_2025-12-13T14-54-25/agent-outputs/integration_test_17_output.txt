The game has made significant progress! The 3D scene now renders properly with visible terrain, lighting works, combat mechanics function correctly, and the UI is complete. The main gaps are visual polish items (skill effects, proper character models, death animations) rather than fundamental integration issues.

The 6 test failures are all timeout-related infrastructure issues, not actual broken functionality - the failed screenshots show the game was still running correctly.
