### Visual Issues Found

1. **No Target Frame UI** - When selecting an enemy, there's no dedicated target frame showing enemy name, health, and level
2. **No visible loot drops** - After enemy death, no loot items appear on the ground
3. **No clear selection indicator** - Target selection ring/highlight on enemy is not prominent
4. **Hit feedback missing** - No screen flash or visual indicator when player takes damage
5. **Cooldown visualization unclear** - Hard to see skill cooldown state on skill bar
6. **Character models are placeholder** - While functional, models are simple humanoid shapes rather than detailed 40K characters

### Summary
- **Functional Tests:** 11/12 passed (92%)
- **Visual Checks:** 28/35 items passed (80%)
- **Critical Visual Issues:**
  - Missing loot drop visuals
  - No target frame UI
  - No hit feedback effects

The combat system is **functionally working** - damage chains work, companions fight, enemies attack back, health bars update, and damage numbers float. However, there are several visual polish items missing that would improve the gameplay feel, particularly around loot visibility and target selection feedback.
