Now I have all the visual data I need. The third screenshot shows combat in progress with an enemy, and the fourth is a blank page (likely from the summary test that failed before initialization). Let me compile the full integration test results.

### Visual Validation

#### Screenshot: 01-initial-scene.png
**What I See:** 
- A 3D game scene with a dark/space-like background
- Player character (Sister Initiate, Lv. 15 Battle Sister) represented as a red spherical model with a gold accent
- Three companion characters visible as red spheres with green health bars above them, labeled "Precise Shot"
- The scene has subtle lighting - characters are illuminated against the dark background
- A circular minimap in the top-right showing "HIVE PRIMUS"
- Full UI overlay is visible

**Checklist:**
- [x] 3D rendered scene is visible (not black screen) - PASS
- [ ] Ground/terrain is visible - FAIL (black void, no ground texture)
- [x] Player character model is visible - PASS (red sphere placeholder)
- [x] 3 companion characters are visible near player - PASS (with health bars)
- [x] Lighting illuminates the scene - PASS (characters are lit)
- [ ] Sky or background is rendered - PARTIAL (dark void, but functional)
- [x] No obvious rendering glitches or artifacts - PASS

#### Screenshot: 02-ui-elements.png
**What I See:**
- Same game scene as initial, slightly different companion positions
- Full UI system visible and functional

**Checklist:**
- [x] Skill bar visible at bottom of screen - PASS (9 color-coded slots: gold, blue, red, green, white, grey, grey, gold, orange)
- [x] Health bar visible for player - PASS (624/735 HP in red/green bar at top-left)

- [x] Party frames or companion status visible - PASS (companions with "Precise Shot" labels and health bars)
- [x] Minimap/compass - PASS (circular minimap showing "HIVE PRIMUS" in top-right)
- [x] Character info panel - PASS (showing "Sister Initiate, Lv. 15 Battle Sister")
- [x] Class selection tabs - PASS (Battle Sister, Guardsman, Choppa Boy, Fire Warrior)
- [x] Chat box - PASS (showing system welcome and party messages)
- [x] Controls help panel - PASS (showing WASD, RMB, LMB, Tab, T, Esc, 1-8, 0, K, P keybinds)
- [x] Level/XP bar - PASS (showing "Level 15 - 35%" at bottom)

#### Screenshot: test-failed-1.png (Death and Loot test)
**What I See:**
- Combat scene with an enemy visible (purple spherical model in upper area)
- Player health reduced to 462/735 (shows damage was taken)
- Companions still active with health bars
- A white rectangular object near the enemy (possibly a weapon or loot drop)
- Clear evidence of combat happening

**Checklist:**
- [x] Enemy model rendered - PASS (purple sphere visible)
- [x] Combat damage occurring - PASS (player HP reduced)
- [x] Companions still following - PASS
- [x] Potential loot/item visible - PARTIAL (white rectangle near enemy)

### Visual Issues Found

1. **No terrain/ground** - The scene renders on a black void with no ground plane or terrain texture
2. **Placeholder character models** - All characters (player, companions, enemies) are spheres instead of actual 40K models
3. **Missing sky/background** - No skybox or environmental background
4. **Visual tests timing out** - 6 of 8 visual validation tests fail due to timeout, indicating potential performance issues or test configuration problems

### Summary
- **Functional Tests:** 18/19 passed (95%)
- **Visual Tests:** 2/8 passed (test infrastructure issues)
- **Visual Checklist Items:** 14/17 verified PASS

### Critical Visual Issues:
1. **No terrain visible** - Players exist in a void
2. **Placeholder spheres** - No actual character/enemy models
3. **No skybox** - Missing environmental context
4. **Test timeouts** - Visual capture tests timing out (may be Playwright configuration issue, not game issue)

### What Works Well:
- Complete UI system (skill bar, health/energy, minimap, chat, controls)
- Health bars on all entities
- Class selection tabs
- Chat system with party messages
- Companion positioning and tracking
- Combat mechanics (damage dealing, cooldowns, targeting)
- Companion AI decision-making
- Level/XP display
