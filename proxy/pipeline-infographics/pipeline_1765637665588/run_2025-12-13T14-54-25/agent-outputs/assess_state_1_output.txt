## Current State

**Client exists: YES**
- Full Three.js 3D client in `/client/` directory
- Vite-based build system with TypeScript
- `index.html` with Guild Wars 1-style UI (8+1 skill bar, party frames, minimap, chat)
- Core architecture includes: Game, World, Player, ThirdPersonCamera, InputManager, EntityManager, CombatManager, PartyManager

**Design docs: Extensive**
- `combat-design.md` - Complete GW1-style combat system (damage formulas, 12 classes across 3 factions, conditions, skill lines)
- `henchmen-heroes-design.md` - Full companion system (henchmen 70%, heroes 90% effectiveness, threat tiers)
- `progression-design.md`, `balance-analysis.md`, `data-model.md`, `api-specification.md`, and more

**Backend code: Substantial**
- Express/TypeScript API server in `/src/`
- PostgreSQL database with migrations
- WebSocket combat handlers
- Services: auth, character, combat, companion, mission, economy
- Full repository pattern with models

**Can run: YES (both)**
- Backend: `npm run dev` (ts-node-dev)
- Client: `cd client && npm run dev` (Vite)

**Current Combat Status (based on user notes):**
- 3D scene visible - PASS
- Player character visible - PASS (placeholder sphere)
- Companions visible - PASS (spheres with health bars)
- Lighting present - PARTIAL (UI lit, scene dark)
- UI complete - PASS (major elements present)
- Actual character models - FAIL (placeholder spheres)
- Visible terrain - FAIL (black void/dark)
- Combat validation - needs more work

**Missing for "combat working":**
- Skill visual effects / animations
- Damage numbers floating up (CombatFeedback exists but may need fixes)
- Enemy AI fighting back (EnemyAI exists)
- Companion AI using skills (CompanionAI exists)
- Health bars updating in real-time
- Sound effects
- Skill cooldown visuals
- Death animations
- Visible loot drops (LootVisualization exists)
- Better lighting/terrain visibility

## Recommendation

The client exists and has significant architecture in place. The core game loop runs, entities spawn, and combat systems are wired up. The issues are primarily **visual polish** - placeholder geometry, dark lighting, and incomplete visual feedback systems.

**We should NOT set up a new client** - we should continue improving the existing one. The next priorities based on user feedback are:
1. Fix terrain/lighting visibility (black void issue)
2. Replace placeholder spheres with actual models or better visuals
3. Ensure combat feedback systems (damage numbers, effects) are fully working
4. Complete enemy/companion AI combat behavior
