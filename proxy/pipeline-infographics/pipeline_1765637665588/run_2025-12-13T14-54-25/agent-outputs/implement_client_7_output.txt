The build succeeded. Now let me provide a summary of the implementation.

---

## Implemented

Based on the reviewed requirements from visual-combat-design.md and the existing client codebase, I implemented the following combat visualization enhancements:

### 1. Floating Combat Text System (CombatFeedback.ts)
- **Positioning**: 2.0 world units above target head (scaled from 100 units spec)
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds per design docs
- **Size scaling by damage**:
  - Minor (0-49): 14pt
  - Normal (50-149): 18pt
  - Significant (150-299): 22pt
  - Massive (300+): 28pt
- **Critical hits**: +25% size with glow effect

### 2. Enemy Threat Tier Health Bars (Enemy.ts)
- **Minoris**: White (#FFFFFF) - 80-150 HP
- **Majoris**: Blue (#4a90d9) - 180-350 HP
- **Extremis**: Yellow (#ffcc00) - 400-800 HP with glow
- **Terminus**: Purple (#9932cc) - 2,000-8,000 HP with glow
- **Apex**: Gold (#ffd700) - 8,000-20,000+ HP with glow
- Boss health bars are larger with corner decorations

### 3. Death Animations by Damage Type (Enemy.ts)
- **KINETIC/PIERCING/RENDING**: Standard fall over
- **THERMAL**: Burn/shrink/dissolve effect
- **EXPLOSIVE**: Thrown back with arc
- **WARP**: Purple spiral implosion
- **ELECTRIC**: Convulse/shake
- **PHOTON**: Flash white then vaporize
- Death duration scales by threat tier (0.5s Minoris to 5.0s Apex)
- Damage-type colored particle effects

### 4. Enhanced Terrain Visibility (World.ts)
- Brighter ambient lighting (1.2 intensity)
- Strong directional light (1.5 intensity) with fill light
- Procedural ground texture with cracks, dirt, and rock patches
- Subtle grid overlay for spatial reference (25% opacity)
- Additional point lights for atmosphere

### 5. Audio System Framework (AudioSystem.ts - NEW FILE)
- Faction-specific sound profiles (Imperial, Tau, Ork, Tyranid, Chaos)
- Procedural weapon sounds (melee/ranged/heavy)
- Skill activation sounds by damage type
- Damage impact sounds with critical hit emphasis
- Dynamic music layer system with 2-second crossfades
- Volume controls per category

### 6. Circular Skill Cooldown Overlay (SkillBar.ts)
- SVG-based circular cooldown visualization
- Countdown number in center
- Skill ready flash animation when cooldown completes
- Backward compatibility with existing linear overlay

## Design Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| "Floating damage 100 units above head, 1.5s duration" | ✅ 2.0 world units, 1500ms duration |
| "Size scaling 14/18/22/28pt by damage amount" | ✅ DAMAGE_SIZE_TIERS array |
| "Critical +25% size with glow" | ✅ CRITICAL_SIZE_MULTIPLIER = 1.25 |
| "Minoris White, Majoris Blue, Extremis Yellow, Terminus Purple, Apex Gold" | ✅ THREAT_TIERS with exact colors |
| "Death animation by damage type" | ✅ 8 death types with unique animations |
| "Boss death 1s+2s+1.5s sequence" | ✅ DEATH_ANIMATION_DURATIONS by tier |
| "2-second music crossfade" | ✅ MUSIC_CROSSFADE_DURATION = 2000ms |
| "Faction weapon sounds" | ✅ FACTION_SOUND_PROFILES with procedural generation |

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/ui/CombatFeedback.ts` - Enhanced floating damage with design doc specs
2. `client/src/game/entities/Enemy.ts` - Threat tier health bars, death animations
3. `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts` - Pass damage type for death animations
4. `client/src/game/World.ts` - Improved lighting and terrain visibility
5. `client/src/ui/SkillBar.ts` - Circular cooldown overlay
6. `client/src/audio/AudioSystem.ts` - **NEW** Audio system framework

## How to Test

1. Start the client:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

2. Test floating damage numbers:
   - Attack enemies to see damage numbers
   - Verify size scales with damage (small hits = 14pt, big hits = 28pt)
   - Critical hits should be 25% larger with glow

3. Test threat tier health bars:
   - Spawn enemies of different HP levels
   - Minoris (white), Majoris (blue), Extremis (yellow), Terminus (purple), Apex (gold)

4. Test death animations:
   - Kill enemies with different damage types
   - THERMAL = dissolve, EXPLOSIVE = knockback, WARP = spiral, etc.

5. Test terrain visibility:
   - Ground should be clearly visible with procedural texture
   - Lighting should illuminate the scene properly
   - Grid overlay provides spatial reference

6. Test skill cooldowns:
   - Use skills and watch circular cooldown overlay
   - Countdown number shows in center
   - Flash effect when skill becomes ready
