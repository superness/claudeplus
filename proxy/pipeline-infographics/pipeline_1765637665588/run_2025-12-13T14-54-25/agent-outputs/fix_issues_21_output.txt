## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Player skill visual effects not playing
- **File**: `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts`
- **Fix**: Added `playSkillEffect()` call in `performSkillExecution()` method. The SkillEffectSystem was initialized but never called when the player executed skills - it was only being called for companion skills. Now when players use skills (melee, ranged, heals, buffs, etc.), the appropriate visual effect (projectiles, melee slashes, cones, explosions, heal particles, buff auras) will play.

### Issue 2: Missing hit feedback when enemies take damage
- **File**: `client/src/game/entities/Enemy.ts`  
- **Fix**: Added a hit flash system with:
  - New state variables: `hitFlashTimer` and `hitFlashDuration`
  - New method `updateHitFlash()` that updates the emissive intensity of enemy meshes during the flash
  - New method `triggerHitFlash()` that starts the flash by setting mesh emissives to white at high intensity
  - Modified `takeDamage()` to call `triggerHitFlash()` when damage is applied

The hit flash creates a brief white emissive glow on all enemy mesh materials for 0.15 seconds when they take damage, providing clear visual feedback that attacks are connecting.
