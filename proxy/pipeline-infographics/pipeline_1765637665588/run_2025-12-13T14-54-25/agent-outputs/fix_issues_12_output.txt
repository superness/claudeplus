## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Terrain/ground not visible (black void)
- File: `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- Fix: 
  - Increased fog distance from 50-200 to 80-300 so terrain is visible farther
  - Changed clear color from `0x0a0a0a` to `0x1a1a1a` (slightly brighter)
  - Increased tone mapping exposure from 0.8 to 1.0 for better visibility

### Issue 2: Sky dome too dark  
- File: `client/src/game/World.ts`
- Fix: Brightened sky dome colors - `topColor` from `0x0a0a0a` to `0x0f0f12`, `bottomColor` from `0x1a0a0a` to `0x251a18`

### Issue 3: Ground texture too dark
- File: `client/src/game/World.ts`
- Fix: 
  - Brightened ground material color from `0x554433` to `0x665544`
  - Brightened base texture color from `#302820` to `#403830`
  - Increased noise brightness range from 30-70 to 40-90

### Issue 4: Multiple enemies test timing out
- File: `client/tests/combat.spec.ts`
- Fix: 
  - Reduced max iterations from 100 to 30
  - Reduced waitForFrames from 10 to 6 frames per iteration
  - Added explicit timeout of 20 seconds to the evaluate call

### Issue 5: Visual validation tests timing out
- File: `client/tests/visual-validation.spec.ts`
- Fix:
  - Added `test.setTimeout(60000)` to all long-running tests
  - Reduced `waitForFrames(30)` calls to `waitForFrames(20)`
  - Reduced `waitForFrames(180)` (3 seconds) to `waitForFrames(90)` (1.5 seconds)
  - Changed "death and loot" test to spawn weaker enemy (`TYR_RIPPER_SWARM`) at closer range
  - Optimized kill loop to check all skill slots and use shorter waits
