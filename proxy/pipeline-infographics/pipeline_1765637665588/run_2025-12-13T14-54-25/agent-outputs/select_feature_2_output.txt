### Why This Feature
All 13 priority features from the list are implemented. The user's feedback indicates **visual polish is the missing piece** - specifically:
- Skill visual effects / animations
- Death animations  
- Better lighting (scene is dark/black void)
- Replace placeholder spheres with actual models

The next step is **improving visual feedback for combat** - skill effects, animations, and fixing the black void/lighting issue that makes terrain invisible. This isn't a new feature from the list, but rather completing "combat working" as defined by the user's requirements.
