### Referenced Systems

**Guild Wars 1 Philosophy:**
> "Readability over spectacle: Players must instantly understand what's happening"
> "Every action has clear visual and audio response"
> "Performance-first: Effects must run smoothly on mid-range hardware"

**Henchmen/Heroes Integration** (from henchmen-heroes-design.md):
- Companions need same visual feedback systems (health bars, damage numbers)
- Heroes at 90% effectiveness, Henchmen at 70% - visual indicators should reflect this
- AI companions follow same death/resurrection visual sequences

**Combat Mechanics Integration** (from combat-design.md):
- 8 damage types must each have distinct visual identity
- Condition effects (Bleeding, Burning, Poison, Corruption, Shock) need visual indicators
- Skill activation times (0.25-3 seconds) must have cast bar visuals
