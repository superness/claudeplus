I'll analyze this request to classify it properly.

## Analysis

**User Request**: Ships instantly jump to their throttle speed instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually. Need smooth acceleration/deceleration with realistic momentum.

**Key Indicators**:
- "instantly jump" - indicates incorrect behavior
- "instead of" - shows expected vs actual behavior mismatch
- "needs to be fixed" - explicit bug language
- Problem: Current behavior is wrong (instant speed changes)
- Expected: Gradual acceleration/deceleration with momentum

**Classification Reasoning**:

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** because:

1. **Something is broken**: The physics system is not working as intended - ships are teleporting to target speeds instead of accelerating smoothly
2. **Core functionality issue**: Movement/physics is fundamental game behavior that's malfunctioning
3. **Behavior correction needed**: The current implementation doesn't match the expected EVE-style physics described in CLAUDE.md
4. **Not a new feature**: Smooth acceleration should already exist (the codebase has `EVEPhysics.js` and `ShipPhysics.js` with exponential acceleration curves documented)
5. **Keywords present**: "issue", "needs to be fixed", describes broken behavior

This is NOT:
- **QUICK_CHANGE**: Requires investigation and likely multi-line physics logic fixes
- **FEATURE_REQUEST**: Smooth acceleration should already be implemented per the architecture docs
- **REFACTOR**: This is fixing broken behavior, not improving working code
- **QUESTION**: User is reporting a problem, not asking for information
