ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
- The plan correctly identifies that reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 is the first critical step
- Demonstrates good practice by planning to examine existing pipeline files to understand the expected JSON schema
- Includes validation steps to ensure JSON structure matches existing patterns
- All 7 stages are clearly enumerated with their service mappings
- File path is specific and concrete (/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json)
- Logical progression of research → understand schema → create file

**Weaknesses:**
- Step 4 (Grep for pipeline-related code) may be unnecessary if the JSON schema is clear from existing templates - could add complexity without value
- The plan doesn't specify what to do if section 3.1 is missing or if no example pipeline files exist (no fallback/error handling)
- "Medium" confidence with reason "need to read documentation" is appropriate, but the plan could be more explicit about what specific information gaps exist
- TEST_CONSIDERATIONS mentions validation but doesn't specify HOW to validate (e.g., JSON lint, schema validation, comparison tool)

**Evidence Quality Analysis:**
The proposed evidence is Strong for most aspects:
1. ✅ Content from section 3.1 - CONCRETE proof of requirements understanding
2. ✅ Examples of existing pipeline JSON - CONCRETE proof of schema understanding  
3. ✅ Complete generated JSON content - CONCRETE proof of deliverable
4. ✅ File write confirmation - VERIFIABLE proof of completion

However, there's a gap: No evidence planned for validating that the JSON actually matches the schema correctly (beyond visual inspection).

**Risk Assessment:**
- LOW risk: The task is well-defined with clear inputs/outputs
- The plan is comprehensive and methodical
- Main risk is if documentation/examples don't exist, but this would be discovered in step 1-2

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The plan provides multiple concrete verification points:
- Source documentation quote (section 3.1)
- Schema examples from existing files
- Complete generated output
- File path confirmation

The evidence trail would clearly demonstrate understanding → research → correct implementation.

**Minor Improvement Suggestions (not blocking):**
- Add explicit JSON validation step (e.g., parse test)
- Specify what to do if MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md doesn't exist
- Could reduce from 6 steps to 4-5 by combining related research steps

**Conclusion:**
This is a well-structured plan with clear steps, concrete evidence collection, and appropriate confidence level. The plan demonstrates understanding of the requirement (create pipeline JSON), has a logical research-then-implement flow, and specifies verifiable evidence. The 7 stages are explicitly listed, preventing scope creep or misunderstanding.
