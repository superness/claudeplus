UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a pipeline JSON file for miner integration based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline has 7 stages with specific component assignments and should be written to a specific file path.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1's specifications and requirements
2. Analyze the pipeline structure and stage definitions provided
3. Examine any existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the correct format/schema
4. Create a properly formatted JSON file with all 7 stages and their component mappings
5. Write the complete pipeline to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1 requirements
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files: `claudeplus/templates/*.json`
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema/format
4) Draft the complete miner-integration.json with:
   - Stage 1: ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager
   - Stage 2: configure_miner → config_generator
   - Stage 3: start_miner → miner_manager
   - Stage 4: verify_stratum_subscribe → stratum_monitor
   - Stage 5: verify_authorization → miner_pool_connector
   - Stage 6: verify_job_delivery → job_validator
   - Stage 7: miner_integration_verified → END
5) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json
6) Use Read tool to verify the written file is correct

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify the JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Ensure all 7 stages are included with correct component mappings
- Confirm the pipeline follows the schema/format of existing pipeline files
- Validate that section 3.1 requirements from the plan document are met
- Check that the END stage is properly defined
- Ensure the file path is created correctly (directory exists, file is writable)

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1
- Format/schema from existing pipeline JSON files
- The complete JSON content written to the file
- Verification read of the final file showing all 7 stages correctly defined

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can read the specification document and create the JSON file, but confidence depends on finding clear documentation of the pipeline JSON schema format in existing files. If existing templates are well-structured, confidence increases to High.
