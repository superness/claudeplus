UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline has 7 specific stages with defined flows (ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager, etc.) and needs to be written as a complete pipeline JSON to a specific file path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1 specifications
2. Examine existing pipeline JSON templates (if any) to understand the expected JSON structure
3. Map the 7 stages to proper pipeline JSON format with correct stage definitions, transitions, and component references
4. Validate the JSON structure matches the pipeline requirements (stages, flows, components)
5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified output path

STEPS:
1. Use Read tool to examine MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and locate section 3.1 specifications
2. Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON schema
3. Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the structure (stages, transitions, components, metadata)
4. Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - 7 stages defined: ensure_pool_running, configure_miner, start_miner, verify_stratum_subscribe, verify_authorization, verify_job_delivery, miner_integration_verified
   - Stage flows mapping to components: pool_server_manager, config_generator, miner_manager, stratum_monitor, miner_pool_connector, job_validator
   - Transition logic between stages
   - Start/end states
5. Use Write tool to create the complete pipeline JSON at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json
6. Verify the file was written correctly using Read tool

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Validate that all 7 stages are present in correct order
- Ensure each stage correctly maps to its designated component (e.g., ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager)
- Verify JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Check that the pipeline has clear start (ensure_pool_running) and end (miner_integration_verified) states
- Ensure transitions between stages are logical and complete
- Validate against section 3.1 requirements from the planning document

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of section 3.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the specifications
- Example pipeline JSON structure from existing templates
- The complete miner-integration.json file content showing all 7 stages with proper mappings
- Verification read of the written file to confirm it matches the design

CONFIDENCE: Medium - Need to first examine the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 to understand full specifications and see existing pipeline JSON examples to match the expected schema. The stage names and component mappings are clearly defined, but the exact JSON structure format needs to be discovered from existing templates.
