UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 7 stages with specific component mappings, and the output should be written as JSON to a specific file path.

APPROACH: I will first read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1's specifications, then examine any existing pipeline templates in the templates directory to understand the expected JSON structure. After understanding the requirements and format, I will plan to construct the complete pipeline JSON with all 7 stages and their configurations.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository
2) Use Read to examine section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand pipeline requirements, component specifications, and any additional configuration details
3) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory to understand the JSON schema/structure
4) Use Read to examine 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the exact format, required fields, and structure
5) Design the complete JSON structure with all 7 stages:
   - ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager
   - configure_miner → config_generator
   - start_miner → miner_manager
   - verify_stratum_subscribe → stratum_monitor
   - verify_authorization → miner_pool_connector
   - verify_job_delivery → job_validator
   - miner_integration_verified → END
6) Include all necessary fields such as stage names, component references, dependencies, timeout configurations, error handling, and any metadata specified in section 3.1
7) Use Write to create the complete pipeline JSON at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates in the templates directory
- Ensure all 7 stages are correctly defined with proper component mappings
- Validate that stage dependencies flow correctly (ensure_pool_running before configure_miner, etc.)
- Check that the END stage is properly referenced from miner_integration_verified
- Ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Verify all component names match those specified in the requirements (pool_server_manager, config_generator, etc.)

EVIDENCE:
- Content from section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the detailed specifications
- Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected schema
- The final miner-integration.json file content showing all 7 stages properly configured
- Validation that the JSON syntax is correct and follows the template structure

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While the stage names and component mappings are clearly specified, I need to read section 3.1 to understand any additional configuration requirements (timeouts, retry logic, error handlers, etc.) and examine existing templates to ensure the JSON structure is correct. The confidence will increase to High once I validate the schema against existing examples.
