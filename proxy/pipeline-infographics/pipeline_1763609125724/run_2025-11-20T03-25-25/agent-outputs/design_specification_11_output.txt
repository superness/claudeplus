UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should define 7 stages with specific handlers, and the output should be written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json`.

APPROACH: 
1. First, locate and read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1's specifications
2. Understand the pipeline structure requirements from the document
3. Map out the 7 stages with their corresponding handlers as specified
4. Determine the correct JSON schema/format for the pipeline definition
5. Check if there are existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to follow the same format
6. Create the complete pipeline JSON structure with all required fields
7. Write the JSON file to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md: `pattern: "**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md"`
2) Use Read to examine section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand pipeline requirements
3) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files: `pattern: "**/templates/*.json"` to understand the expected format
4) Use Read to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to determine the schema structure
5) Use Grep to search for pipeline-related code to understand handler specifications: `pattern: "pool_server_manager|config_generator|miner_manager"` 
6) Construct the JSON structure with all 7 stages:
   - ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager
   - configure_miner → config_generator
   - start_miner → miner_manager
   - verify_stratum_subscribe → stratum_monitor
   - verify_authorization → miner_pool_connector
   - verify_job_delivery → job_validator
   - miner_integration_verified → END
7) Use Bash to verify the target directory exists: `ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/`
8) Use Write to create the miner-integration.json file at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json`
9) Use Read to verify the written file is valid JSON and contains all required stages
10) Use Bash to validate JSON syntax: `cat /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json | python3 -m json.tool` (if available)

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify the JSON structure matches the schema used by other pipeline files
- Ensure all 7 stages are included in the correct order
- Validate that each stage has the proper handler mapping
- Confirm the final stage correctly points to END
- Check that the file path is accessible and writable
- Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and parseable
- Verify no required fields from section 3.1 are missing
- Test that the pipeline definition aligns with the automation plan specifications

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of section 3.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing pipeline specifications
- Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected schema format
- The complete JSON content that will be written to miner-integration.json
- File listing showing the created file exists at the target path
- JSON validation output confirming proper syntax
- Comparison showing all 7 stages are correctly mapped to their handlers

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a structured task with clear requirements (7 stages and their handlers are explicitly provided). However, confidence depends on:
- Finding and reading section 3.1 of the automation plan document to ensure full compliance
- Understanding the exact JSON schema expected by examining existing pipeline files
- Confirming all handler names and any additional required fields per the specification
