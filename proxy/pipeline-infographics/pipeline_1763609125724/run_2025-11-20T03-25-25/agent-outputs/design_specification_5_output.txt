UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 7 stages with specific service calls, and the final JSON should be written to a specific path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1's requirements and specifications
2. Examine existing pipeline JSON templates in the claudeplus/templates directory to understand the expected structure and format
3. Map each stage (ensure_pool_running, configure_miner, start_miner, verify_stratum_subscribe, verify_authorization, verify_job_delivery, miner_integration_verified) to their corresponding services
4. Structure the pipeline JSON with proper dependencies, parameters, and flow control
5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified location

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool on MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to examine section 3.1 specifications for the miner-integration pipeline
2) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files: pattern "*.json" in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/
3) Use Read tool on 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure
4) Use Grep to search for references to the services mentioned (pool_server_manager, config_generator, miner_manager, stratum_monitor, miner_pool_connector, job_validator) to understand their interfaces and parameters
5) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stages array with proper ordering and dependencies
   - Each stage containing: id, service, action, parameters, success_criteria, failure_handling
   - Flow control logic for stage transitions
   - Final verification stage leading to END state
6) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json with the complete pipeline structure

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify the pipeline handles the sequential flow: pool setup → miner config → miner start → stratum subscribe → authorization → job delivery → verification
- Ensure proper error handling at each stage (what happens if pool fails to start, miner config is invalid, stratum connection fails, etc.)
- Validate that each stage has appropriate success/failure criteria
- Check that dependencies between stages are correctly specified (e.g., can't start miner before pool is running)
- Ensure the pipeline can handle edge cases like timeouts, connection failures, and invalid configurations
- Verify the final stage properly transitions to END state upon successful integration

EVIDENCE:
- Content from section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing requirements
- Example pipeline JSON structures from existing templates
- Service interface definitions from codebase search results
- Complete miner-integration.json file with all 7 stages properly configured
- Validation that JSON is syntactically correct and follows the template schema

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While the stage names and service mappings are clearly specified, I need to read the actual MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 to understand specific requirements, parameters, timeouts, and success criteria for each stage. The confidence will increase to High once I examine the specification document and existing pipeline templates to ensure proper structure.
