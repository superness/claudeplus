ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. The plan correctly identifies the need to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md first to understand requirements
2. Shows logical sequencing: find file → read section 3.1 → analyze → check examples → create JSON → write file
3. Identifies the 7 stages with their specific component mappings as provided by the user
4. Recognizes the importance of checking existing pipeline formats for consistency
5. Lists comprehensive test considerations (JSON validity, stage ordering, component mappings, etc.)

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence quality is WEAK** - The plan does not specify what concrete artifacts will prove the task is complete beyond "showing the JSON structure" and "verify file was written"
2. **Missing validation steps** - No plan to validate the JSON against a schema or test it with the actual system
3. **Vague success criteria** - "Will show the complete JSON structure" is not specific enough. What makes it "complete" and "correct"?
4. **No verification of section 3.1 alignment** - Doesn't specify how it will prove the implementation matches section 3.1's specifications
5. **Confidence level is concerning** - "Medium" confidence with 4 significant dependencies suggests uncertainty about requirements
6. **Missing specifics on JSON structure** - Doesn't detail what fields/properties each stage needs (inputs, outputs, validators, error handlers, etc.)

**Specific Gaps:**
- No mention of how to verify the pipeline will actually work when consumed by the system
- Doesn't specify what exact information from section 3.1 will be extracted and how
- No plan to validate that component names match existing components in the codebase
- Lacks detail on how transitions/dependencies between stages will be encoded

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence consists mainly of:
- Showing file contents (not proof of correctness)
- Confirming file write (not proof of functionality)
- Displaying the JSON (not proof it meets requirements)

**Missing evidence:**
- Detailed mapping of section 3.1 requirements → JSON implementation
- Validation that all required fields per section 3.1 are present
- Proof that component names reference real, existing components
- Confirmation that JSON schema matches system expectations

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific reasoning:**
1. The plan lacks concrete, verifiable evidence that the pipeline JSON will be correct and complete according to section 3.1
2. "Medium" confidence indicates the planner is uncertain about critical aspects
3. No validation strategy to prove the JSON will work with the consuming system
4. Evidence steps are too generic ("will show", "will verify") without measurable success criteria
5. Missing specific extraction plan for requirements from section 3.1

**What would make this APPROVABLE:**
- Specify exact fields/properties to extract from section 3.1 (e.g., "for each stage, extract: name, component, inputs[], outputs[], validators[], error_handlers[]")
- Define concrete validation: "JSON must parse without errors AND match schema X AND reference only existing components"
- Better evidence: "Will create comparison table: Section 3.1 Requirement | JSON Implementation | Status"
- Higher confidence with clear justification or acknowledge need for iterative refinement
- Plan to validate component names exist in codebase (e.g., grep for pool_server_manager, config_generator, etc.)

DECISION: REJECTED
