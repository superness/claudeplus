Excellent! The miner-integration pipeline has been successfully created. Let me provide a summary of what was delivered:

## Pipeline Creation Summary

**File Created**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json`

**Pipeline Structure**: Complete JSON configuration matching the schema from existing SuperCoinServ pipelines

### 7 Stages Implemented (as specified in section 3.1):

1. **ensure_pool_running** → `pool_server_manager`
   - Verifies pool server is up and stratum port is listening
   - Timeout: 15 seconds
   - Failure action: abort

2. **configure_miner** → `config_generator`
   - Generates miner configuration with pool URL and worker credentials
   - Supports parameterized pool URL, port, worker name, and password
   - Timeout: 15 seconds
   - Failure action: abort

3. **start_miner** → `miner_manager`
   - Launches mining software with generated configuration
   - Verifies process is running
   - Timeout: 30 seconds
   - Failure action: cleanup_and_abort

4. **verify_stratum_subscribe** → `stratum_monitor`
   - Checks stratum subscribe handshake completion
   - Verifies extranonce assignment
   - Includes 5-second wait for connection establishment
   - Timeout: 20 seconds
   - Failure action: retry_or_abort

5. **verify_authorization** → `miner_pool_connector`
   - Validates worker authorization
   - Confirms difficulty is set
   - Timeout: 15 seconds
   - Failure action: check_credentials_and_abort

6. **verify_job_delivery** → `job_validator`
   - Confirms miner receives valid mining jobs
   - Validates job format and required fields
   - Includes 3-second wait for job delivery
   - Timeout: 35 seconds
   - Failure action: diagnose_and_abort

7. **miner_integration_verified** → `stratum_monitor` + `miner_manager`
   - Final validation of stable connection
   - Verifies jobs are flowing and miner is healthy
   - Timeout: 15 seconds per action
   - Failure action: report_partial_success

### Additional Configuration Sections:

- **pipeline_config**: Default settings for pool connection, timeouts, and logging
- **validation_settings**: Stratum protocol validation rules and required job fields
- **cleanup_on_completion**: Defines post-pipeline cleanup behavior

The pipeline follows the established JSON schema from existing SuperCoinServ pipelines and fully implements the requirements from section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md.
