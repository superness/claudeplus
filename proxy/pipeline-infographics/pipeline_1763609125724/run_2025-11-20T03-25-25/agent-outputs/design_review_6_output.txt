ASSESSMENT:

**Understanding of Requirements:**
The plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the core task - creating a 7-stage miner-integration pipeline JSON based on section 3.1 of a specification document. The stage sequence is clearly outlined with service mappings provided.

**Approach Quality:**
The approach is methodical and logical:
- ✅ Reading the specification document first (essential)
- ✅ Examining existing templates to understand schema structure
- ✅ Searching for service interfaces to understand parameters
- ✅ Structured design methodology
- ✅ Writing to the specified output location

**Critical Strengths:**
1. Explicitly plans to read section 3.1 before implementation (not making assumptions)
2. Will examine existing pipeline JSON templates to ensure consistency
3. Plans to search for service interface definitions
4. Considers error handling and edge cases
5. Clear sequential steps from research → design → implementation

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague Evidence Specification**: The plan lists what will be collected but doesn't specify HOW to verify the pipeline is correct. What makes a "properly configured" stage? How will we know the JSON structure is complete?

2. **Missing Validation Steps**: No mention of:
   - JSON schema validation against any defined schema
   - Comparing against section 3.1's actual requirements checklist
   - Verifying all required fields per stage are present
   - Testing JSON syntax validity

3. **Medium Confidence Flag**: The designer explicitly states "Medium confidence" because they haven't read the specification yet. This is concerning - the plan should be based on actual requirements, not assumptions.

4. **Incomplete Test Considerations**: While edge cases are mentioned, there's no plan to verify the pipeline JSON actually addresses them in the final artifact.

**Evidence Quality Issues:**
- "Complete miner-integration.json file with all 7 stages properly configured" - This is circular. What defines "properly configured"?
- "Validation that JSON is syntactically correct and follows the template schema" - No specific validation tool or method mentioned
- Missing: A concrete checklist derived from section 3.1 that can be verified against the final output

**What's Missing:**
1. Specific validation criteria from section 3.1 (can only be determined after reading it)
2. A concrete checklist of required fields per stage
3. Method for validating the JSON (tool, schema, manual verification)
4. Comparison criteria against existing pipeline templates
5. Clear success criteria: "The pipeline is complete when X, Y, Z are verified"

**Positive Aspects:**
- The research-first approach is correct
- Service mapping is clearly specified
- Error handling is considered
- The plan won't proceed blindly without reading specs

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is too vague and lacks concrete verification methods. Phrases like "properly configured" and "follows the template schema" don't provide measurable validation criteria. There's no specification of what exact elements from section 3.1 will be checked against the final output.

**To improve to Strong, the plan would need:**
- Specific checklist items extracted from section 3.1
- Named validation tool or method (e.g., "validate using jq", "compare against schema.json")
- Concrete field-by-field verification approach
- Clear pass/fail criteria

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** 
While the approach is sound and research-focused, the plan lacks concrete, verifiable evidence collection methods. The "Medium confidence" self-assessment indicates the planner knows they're working with incomplete information. The evidence criteria are too vague ("properly configured", "follows schema") without specific validation methods. 

**Required Revisions:**
1. The plan should be resubmitted AFTER reading section 3.1, with specific requirements extracted
2. Add concrete validation steps (JSON syntax check, schema validation, field-by-field verification)
3. Define measurable success criteria based on actual specification requirements
4. Specify exact validation methodology (tools, comparison methods)
5. Increase confidence to High with justification based on actual specification content

The planner should execute steps 1-3 of their plan (read spec, examine templates, search services) and then resubmit a plan with concrete, specification-based evidence criteria.

DECISION: REJECTED
