ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding of the core requirement: Create a miner-integration pipeline JSON with 7 specific stages
2. Logical step-by-step approach: Read documentation → Examine templates → Create JSON → Write file
3. All 7 stages with component mappings are explicitly listed and match the user's specifications
4. Appropriate research steps to understand both the requirements (section 3.1) and the expected format (existing templates)
5. Good consideration of JSON structure validation and dependency flow

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague evidence specification**: "Content from section 3.1" and "Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected schema" are not concrete evidence that the TASK WAS COMPLETED - they're evidence of research done
2. **Missing verification steps**: No plan to validate that the created file:
   - Actually exists at the target path after writing
   - Contains valid JSON syntax (e.g., running a JSON validator or attempting to parse it)
   - Matches the schema of existing templates (specific field-by-field comparison)
3. **No concrete success criteria**: What specifically will prove the pipeline is correct? Just writing a file doesn't prove it works
4. **Confidence rating explanation is weak**: "Medium confidence" rising to "High" after reading files, but no concrete criteria for when to consider the task complete

**Critical Gap:**
The plan focuses heavily on preparation (reading files) but lacks specific, verifiable evidence that the FINAL OUTPUT is correct. The evidence section should specify:
- A read-back of the created file to verify its contents
- Validation that all 7 stages are present in the correct format
- Comparison against template schema
- JSON syntax validation result

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence describes the INPUT sources (documentation, templates) rather than OUTPUT verification. Strong evidence would include:
- "Read back /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json and confirm it contains all 7 stages with correct component mappings"
- "Validate JSON syntax using a parser"
- "Verify file matches the schema pattern from existing templates (show specific field comparison)"

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:**
The plan needs to add concrete verification steps AFTER writing the file to prove completion:
1. Read back the created file and display its contents
2. Validate JSON syntax (use bash `jq` or similar)
3. Verify all 7 stages are present with correct component mappings by listing them
4. Compare structure against an example template to confirm schema compliance

Without these verification steps, there's no concrete proof the task was successfully completed beyond "I wrote a file."

DECISION: REJECTED
