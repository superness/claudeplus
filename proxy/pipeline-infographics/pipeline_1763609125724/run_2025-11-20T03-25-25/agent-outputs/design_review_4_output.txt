ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. ✓ Clear understanding that this is about creating a miner-integration pipeline JSON based on section 3.1 of a specification document
2. ✓ All 7 stages and their component mappings are explicitly listed
3. ✓ Logical approach: read spec → find existing templates → understand schema → design → write
4. ✓ Sensible steps to discover the JSON format by examining existing pipeline files
5. ✓ Considers validation and directory existence

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SPECIFICATION**: The plan states evidence will include "Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1" and "Example pipeline JSON files" but does NOT specify:
   - What specific validation criteria from section 3.1 must be satisfied
   - How to verify each stage's component mapping is correct
   - What makes a pipeline definition "complete" and "correct"
   - How to confirm the JSON schema matches the expected format
   
2. **VAGUE SUCCESS CRITERIA**: "The complete miner-integration.json file content showing all 7 stages properly configured" - What does "properly configured" mean? What parameters are required? What values are valid?

3. **CONFIDENCE MISMATCH**: Medium confidence is stated, but the plan doesn't address how to handle uncertainty about:
   - JSON schema requirements
   - Required vs optional fields
   - Parameter specifications for each stage
   - Integration points between stages

4. **MISSING VERIFICATION STEPS**: No specific plan to:
   - Validate the JSON against a schema (if one exists)
   - Test that the pipeline definition is loadable/parseable by the system
   - Confirm the component names match actual system components

5. **TEST CONSIDERATIONS ARE TOO GENERIC**: "Will ensure JSON is valid" - how? "Will verify all 7 stages included" - what about stage ordering, dependencies, transitions?

**What's Missing:**
- Concrete acceptance criteria derived from section 3.1
- Specific field-by-field validation plan
- Method to verify component names are correct (check against actual codebase)
- Fallback plan if no existing pipeline templates are found
- Way to validate the pipeline would actually work in the system

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak** - The plan identifies what documents to read but doesn't specify what concrete evidence will prove the implementation matches the requirements. Reading a file and writing JSON is not sufficient proof without validation criteria.

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the plan shows understanding of the basic task, it lacks the rigor needed to prove the pipeline JSON is correct and complete. The evidence proposed is primarily "I wrote a file with 7 stages" rather than "The pipeline meets these specific validation criteria from section 3.1." The plan needs:
1. Specific validation criteria extracted from section 3.1
2. Concrete schema compliance checks
3. Component existence verification in the codebase
4. Clear definition of what makes each stage "properly configured"

The planner should revise to include concrete, verifiable evidence that the JSON meets all requirements, not just that it exists with the right stage names.

DECISION: REJECTED
