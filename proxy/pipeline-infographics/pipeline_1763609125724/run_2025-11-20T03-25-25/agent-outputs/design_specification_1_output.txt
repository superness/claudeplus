UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 7 stages with specific transitions between components (ensure_pool_running → pool_server_manager, etc.) and output the complete pipeline JSON to a specific file path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1's requirements and specifications
2. Analyze the pipeline stages and their connections to understand the data flow and dependencies
3. Determine the correct JSON structure for the pipeline configuration
4. Create the JSON configuration with all 7 stages properly connected
5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified file path

STEPS:
1) Use Glob tool to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository
2) Use Read tool to read the contents of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically looking for section 3.1
3) Analyze section 3.1 to understand:
   - Pipeline stage definitions and requirements
   - Component specifications (pool_server_manager, config_generator, miner_manager, etc.)
   - Expected inputs/outputs for each stage
   - Error handling and validation requirements
   - Any specific configuration parameters needed
4) Check if there are existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected format
5) Design the JSON structure including:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions with proper ordering (1-7)
   - Component mappings for each stage
   - Transition rules between stages
   - Success/failure criteria for each stage
   - Any required parameters or configuration values
6) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json with the complete pipeline configuration

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify that the pipeline JSON structure is valid and parseable
- Ensure all 7 stages are properly defined in sequence
- Confirm that component mappings match the specified transitions
- Validate that the pipeline has a clear start (ensure_pool_running) and end (miner_integration_verified → END)
- Check for any required parameters or configuration values mentioned in section 3.1
- Ensure error handling and rollback strategies are included if specified in the documentation
- Verify the output file path directory exists before writing

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the complete contents of section 3.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will show the complete JSON structure with all stages and transitions
- Will verify the file was written successfully to the correct path
- Will display any existing pipeline examples found for format validation

CONFIDENCE: Medium - The task is straightforward (create JSON file with 7 stages), but confidence depends on:
1. Whether MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and contains section 3.1
2. The level of detail provided in section 3.1 about pipeline structure and requirements
3. Whether there are existing pipeline examples to follow for format consistency
4. Understanding the exact JSON schema expected by the system that will consume this pipeline

DECISION: design_complete
