UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should include 7 specific stages with their corresponding services, and output the complete pipeline JSON to a specific file path.

APPROACH: First, I will read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1's specifications. Then, I will examine any existing pipeline templates or related files to understand the expected JSON structure. Finally, I will plan to create the JSON configuration file with the 7 stages following the correct schema.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and examine section 3.1 to understand pipeline requirements, stage definitions, and expected behavior
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files (pattern: "**/*pipeline*.json" or "**/templates/*.json") to understand the expected JSON schema/structure
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example pipeline files to identify the correct JSON format, required fields, and structure
4) Use Grep tool to search for pipeline-related code (pattern: "pipeline" with glob: "*.cs") to understand how pipelines are parsed and what fields are required
5) Design the complete JSON structure with all 7 stages mapping to their respective services as specified
6) Plan to use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json with the properly formatted pipeline JSON

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline schemas in the codebase
- Will ensure all 7 stages are correctly mapped to their designated services
- Will validate that the stage flow follows the logical progression: ensure_pool_running → configure_miner → start_miner → verify_stratum_subscribe → verify_authorization → verify_job_delivery → miner_integration_verified
- Will check for any additional metadata or configuration fields required by the pipeline system
- Will ensure proper JSON formatting and syntax

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the content from section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the requirements
- Will show examples of existing pipeline JSON files demonstrating the expected schema
- Will display the complete generated JSON file content
- Will confirm the file is written to the correct path: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to read the documentation and examine existing pipeline files to understand the exact JSON schema required. The stage mappings are clearly defined, but the JSON structure needs to be validated against the existing codebase patterns.

DECISION: design_complete
