UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a miner-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should include 7 stages with specific components, and the output should be a JSON file at /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1 and the context for the miner-integration pipeline
2. Analyze the requirements for each stage and their corresponding components
3. Determine the proper JSON structure for the pipeline definition
4. Look for any existing pipeline templates in the repository to understand the expected format
5. Design the complete JSON structure with all 7 stages, ensuring proper flow from ensure_pool_running through to miner_integration_verified (END)

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.1 specifications
2) Use Glob tool to search for existing pipeline JSON files (pattern: "**/*pipeline*.json" or "**/templates/*.json") to understand the expected format
3) Use Read tool to examine any found pipeline templates to determine the JSON schema
4) Design the JSON structure including:
   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages
   - Component mappings (pool_server_manager, config_generator, miner_manager, stratum_monitor, miner_pool_connector, job_validator)
   - Stage transitions and dependencies
   - Any required parameters, timeouts, or validation criteria per stage
5) Plan to use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/miner-integration.json with the complete pipeline definition
6) Verify the directory /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists, or plan to create it if needed

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Will verify all 7 stages are included in correct order
- Will confirm each stage maps to the correct component as specified
- Will validate the pipeline flow from start to END
- Will check that the template directory path is accessible and writable
- Will ensure the JSON structure is compatible with any existing pipeline processing system in the codebase

EVIDENCE:
- Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 showing the requirements
- Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected format/schema
- The complete miner-integration.json file content showing all 7 stages properly configured
- Verification that the file is written to the correct location

CONFIDENCE: Medium - Need to read the specification document first to understand exact requirements and see existing pipeline format examples. The stage list is clear, but the JSON schema details, parameters, and integration points need to be verified from existing documentation and code.
