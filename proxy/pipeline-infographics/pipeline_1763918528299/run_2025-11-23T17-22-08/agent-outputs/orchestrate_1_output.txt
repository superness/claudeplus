## Infrastructure State Analysis

Based on my comprehensive checks, here's the current state:

**✓ OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS:**
1. **Bitcoin Daemon**: Running (PIDs 3919, 6577) in regtest mode
   - RPC accessible on port 18443
   - Block height: 332 blocks
   - RPC credentials match pool config (coiniumtest/testpass123)

2. **CoiniumServ Pool**: Process running (PID 51360)
   - Binary exists and executing
   - Logs show Stratum server initialized on 0.0.0.0:3333
   - Configuration files present (default.json, bitcoin.json)

3. **Miner**: cpuminer process running (PID 5859)
   - Configured to connect to Windows host (10.255.255.254:3333)
   - Using coinbase address: bcrt1qz3hwmxh4q08jeezesuz3sfs6q953w8ddwtdspd

**✗ CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED:**

1. **Wallet Not Funded**: 
   - Wallet balance: 0 BTC (immature: 0, unconfirmed: 0)
   - 332 blocks exist but wallet has no funds
   - Mining cannot proceed without funded wallet

2. **Stratum Port Not Listening**:
   - Pool logs claim Stratum listening on 3333
   - Connection test failed: "Connection refused"
   - Port 3333 not shown in listening ports (only 18443)
   - This indicates Stratum server initialization failed or crashed

3. **Pool-Daemon RPC Connection Issues**:
   - Debug logs show RPC errors when trying to validate addresses
   - Pool cannot call getblocktemplate without working RPC

4. **Statistics Recaching Errors**:
   - Repeated error: "The method or operation is not implemented"
   - Non-critical but indicates incomplete pool implementation

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
The pool server appears to be in a degraded state - the process is running but Stratum server is not actually listening. This could be due to:
- Pool startup failure during Stratum initialization
- RPC connection issues preventing full initialization
- Silent crash of Stratum subsystem while main process continues

**GAPS IN INFRASTRUCTURE:**
- Wallet needs funding (101 blocks should be generated)
- Pool needs recovery (Stratum not actually running despite process existence)
- Miner configured but cannot connect (Stratum down + wrong host IP for local setup)

## Decision Reasoning

I have partial infrastructure but it's in a **broken state**. The pool process exists but is not functional - Stratum port isn't listening and RPC communication is failing. The wallet is also unfunded despite having 332 blocks.

This is a **recovery scenario** rather than a fresh setup. I need to:
1. Fix the broken pool server (Stratum port issue, RPC failures)
2. Fund the wallet (generate blocks)
3. Validate end-to-end connectivity

The error recovery agent should diagnose why Stratum isn't listening despite the pool process running, fix the RPC communication issues, and potentially restart the pool properly.

DECISION: delegate_recovery
