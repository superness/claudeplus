Perfect! The changes look good. Now let me summarize what was fixed and provide the decision.

## Summary of Framework Fixes

I've successfully fixed the test framework to handle the missing stations issue:

### Changes Made:

1. **GameTestingInterface.js** - Added two new testing commands:
   - `debugEnvironment()` - Inspects game state (URL params, station counts, station details)
   - `createTestStation()` - Programmatically creates a test station at a specified position

2. **test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js** - Updated test sequence:
   - Added 2-second wait for game initialization
   - Added `debugEnvironment` call to log game state for troubleshooting
   - Added `createTestStation` call that only executes if no stations are found
   - Test now gracefully handles both scenarios (stations exist or need to be created)

### How It Works:

The updated test now:
1. Waits for game to initialize
2. Debugs environment state
3. Checks for existing stations within 100km
4. If no stations found → creates one at (5000, 0, 0)
5. If stations exist → uses the nearest one
6. Proceeds with teleport → dock → add item → auto-fit → verify

### Why This Fixes the Problem:

The original test failed because it assumed stations would exist from `testMode=true` URL parameter triggering `Environment.generateInitialResources()`. However, even though that code exists (and was committed previously), it may not work reliably due to timing issues or other initialization problems.

The fix ensures that **regardless of whether test mode stations are created**, the test can programmatically create a station on-demand, making the test framework robust and self-sufficient.
