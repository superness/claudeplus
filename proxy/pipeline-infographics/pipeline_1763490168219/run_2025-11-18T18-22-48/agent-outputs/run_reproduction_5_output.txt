## Execution Summary

The bug reproduction script was successfully executed, but encountered a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** before reaching the actual bug reproduction:

### What Happened:
1. ✅ **Environment Setup**: HTTP server started correctly with `-c-1` flag (no caching)
2. ✅ **Script Found**: `test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js` located and executed
3. ✅ **Chrome Launched**: ChromeManager successfully launched Chrome and captured console logs
4. ❌ **Test Failed**: The `dock` command failed with "No stations within range (10km)"
5. ❌ **Game Disconnected**: Chrome closed before completing the test sequence

### Root Cause:
The test environment doesn't guarantee that a station will be within docking range (10km) when the game initializes. The player ship spawned too far from any station, causing the first test step to fail.

### Evidence Collected:
- **File**: `bug_evidence_1763490692862.json`
- **Console Logs**: 5 entries captured (ChromeManager working correctly)
- **Commands Executed**: 1 (dock)
- **Status**: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

### Next Steps Required:
The reproduction script needs to be enhanced with one of these solutions:
1. Add a command to teleport/move the player ship near a station before docking
2. Enhance the `dock` command to auto-navigate to the nearest station if none are in range
3. Add a game initialization parameter to spawn the player near a station in test mode

**The bug itself (auto-fit TypeError) was not reached because the test couldn't get past the docking prerequisite.**
