## Execution Report

The bug reproduction test executed but encountered an **infrastructure limitation** preventing full reproduction:

  },
  "frameworkError": false,
  "consoleLogsCaptured": true
}
```

### Key Findings

1. **Test Infrastructure Works**: ChromeManager successfully launched browser, captured console logs, and executed test commands
2. **Environment Issue**: No stations exist in game world when loaded in test mode
3. **Test Blocked Early**: Cannot proceed past step 1 (dock) without stations present
4. **Bug Not Reproduced**: Test cannot reach the auto-fit code path due to missing game state

### Root Cause Analysis

The reproduction script requires:
- Step 1: Dock at station ❌ **BLOCKED** - no stations in range
- Step 2: Add item to inventory (requires being docked)
- Step 3: Verify inventory
- Step 4: Call autoFitItem (reproduces bug)
- Step 5: Verify fitting

The game loads in `testMode=true` but doesn't initialize stations in the game world, preventing the test from proceeding.

### Recommendation

This is a **test environment setup issue**, not a framework error. The reproduction script logic is correct, but the game's test mode needs enhancement to spawn stations automatically, or the reproduction script needs to manually create stations before attempting to dock.

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
