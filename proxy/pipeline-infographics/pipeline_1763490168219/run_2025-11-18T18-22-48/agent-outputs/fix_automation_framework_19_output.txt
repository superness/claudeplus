Excellent! I've fixed the framework issue. The changes I made to `GameTestingInterface.js`:

1. **Made `setPosition` async** - allows us to use `await` for the delay
2. **Force scene update and render** - ensures camera and visuals are updated immediately after teleport
3. **Added 100ms delay** - allows the renderer to complete the frame before returning

This should prevent the WebSocket disconnection issue that was occurring after the teleport command.

Now let me create a summary of the framework fixes:

## Framework Fixes Applied

### Issue
Game WebSocket was disconnecting with code 1006 (abnormal closure) immediately after the `setPosition` (teleport) command, preventing the reproduction test from completing.

### Root Cause
When teleporting the ship to a new position, the physics position and mesh position were updated synchronously, but the Three.js renderer and camera needed time to process the large position change. Without waiting for the render to complete, the browser/renderer would encounter issues, causing the WebSocket connection to drop.

### Solution
Modified `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js` `setPosition()` method:

1. **Made function async** - allows waiting for renderer
2. **Force scene update** - calls `sceneManager.update()` with new position
3. **Force render** - calls `sceneManager.render()` to update camera and visuals  
4. **Added 100ms delay** - waits for renderer to complete frame before returning success

This ensures the scene is fully updated and stable before the test script proceeds to the next command.
