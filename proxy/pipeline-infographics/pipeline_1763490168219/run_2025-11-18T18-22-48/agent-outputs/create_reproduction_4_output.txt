Excellent! The reproduction script is now ready. Let me create a summary of what was created:

## Bug Reproduction Script Created

I've successfully created an automated bug reproduction script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`.

### Script Details

**Bug Being Reproduced:**
- Ship fitting auto-fit fails with TypeError when double-clicking inventory items
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')" at StationUI.js:1605
- Root cause: Ship ID mismatch between StationUI ('player_ship_1') and ShipFittingManager ('player')

**Test Scenario (5 steps):**
1. **Dock at station** - Required for fitting operations
2. **Add Mining Laser I to inventory** - Creates test item for auto-fitting
3. **Verify item in inventory** - Confirms item exists before auto-fit
4. **Call autoFitItem command** - Directly calls StationUI.autoFitItem() to reproduce the bug
5. **Verify fitted items** - Checks if item was successfully fitted

**How It Works:**
- The script uses the new `autoFitItem` command in GameTestingInterface.js (line 641)
- This command directly calls `StationUI.autoFitItem()`, reproducing the exact double-click behavior
- **If bug exists**: Command fails with TypeError, script reports "BUG REPRODUCED"
- **If bug is fixed**: Item is successfully fitted, script reports "BUG NOT REPRODUCED"

**Key Features:**
- Uses correct variable naming (testClientServer vs testClient) from reference template
- Captures console logs and errors for evidence collection
- Special error handling for the expected TypeError
- Generates detailed evidence JSON file with all test data

**To Run:**
```bash
node test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js
```

The script will automatically launch Chrome with ChromeManager, run the test sequence, and report whether the bug was reproduced.
