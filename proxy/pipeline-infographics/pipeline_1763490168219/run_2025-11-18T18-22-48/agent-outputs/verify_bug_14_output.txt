## Verification Analysis

### Evidence Checklist Assessment

❌ **CRITICAL EVIDENCE MISSING**

1. ✅ Evidence file exists: `bug_evidence_1763491825064.json`
2. ✅ Evidence file contains "commands" array: 1 command executed
3. ⚠️ Evidence file contains "status": "BUG_REPRODUCED" BUT...
4. ✅ Console log file path present: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`
5. ✅ Console logs array populated: 5 entries captured
6. ❌ **Test script was NOT fully executed**: Only 1/5 steps completed
7. ❌ **Runtime state snapshots for BUG incomplete**: No dock operation, no auto-fit attempt, no TypeError captured

## Critical Findings

### ❌ Bug NOT Reproduced During Test

The evidence shows:

1. **Test Incomplete**: Only getShipState command executed (step 1 of 5)
2. **Chrome Disconnected**: Browser terminated before critical steps
3. **Environment Issue**: "No stations exist in game world - cannot test docking"
4. **No Bug Evidence**: The reported TypeError was NEVER observed in this test run
5. **Wrong Console Errors**: All console errors are Chrome GCM authentication issues, NOT ship fitting bugs

### Console Log Analysis Details

**Console Errors Captured (5 total):**
- 3× "Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT"
- 1× "Error code: 401 Error message: Authentication Failed: wrong_secret"
- 1× "Failed to log in to GCM, resetting connection."

**Console Errors Expected (0 captured):**
- ❌ "Quantum Universe error: Script error." from QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715
- ❌ "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')" from StationUI.js:1605

### Why Evidence is Insufficient

The test execution did NOT provide runtime evidence of:
- Docking at a station
- Opening ship fitting UI
- Double-clicking an inventory item
- Calling autoFitItem function
- TypeError when accessing undefined.hull
- Error handler in QuantumUniverseIntegration.js

**Status Field Contradiction**: The evidence file claims `"status": "BUG_REPRODUCED"`, but this is **incorrect**. The test framework marked this status based on theoretical root cause analysis (Ship ID mismatch), NOT based on actual runtime observation of the bug during test execution.

## Comparison to Bug Report

**User Reported:**
- Error 1: 'Quantum Universe error: Script error.' at QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715
- Error 2: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')' at StationUI.js:1605

**Test Captured:**
- ❌ Neither error observed
- ❌ Auto-fit operation never attempted
- ❌ No station interaction
- ✅ Only basic ship state query succeeded

---

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The test framework executed correctly but did not reach the critical auto-fit operation due to Chrome disconnection and missing game world stations. The reported TypeError ('Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)') was **NOT captured during this test run**. Console logs contain only Chrome authentication errors unrelated to ship fitting. 

**Cannot confirm bug existence from runtime evidence alone.** 

Recommend: Manual browser testing with DevTools OR static code analysis of StationUI.js:1605 to verify the Ship ID mismatch hypothesis.
