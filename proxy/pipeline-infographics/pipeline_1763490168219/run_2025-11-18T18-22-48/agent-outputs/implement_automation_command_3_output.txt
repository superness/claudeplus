Perfect! Now let me create a JSON response documenting the implementation:

```json
{
  "commandName": "autoFitItem",
  "implementation": "Added autoFitItem command that simulates double-clicking an inventory item to auto-fit it. The command calls StationUI.autoFitItem(itemId) directly, which will reproduce the ship ID mismatch bug at line 1605 where StationUI uses this.currentShipId='player_ship_1' instead of the correct shipId='player' expected by ShipFittingManager.",
  "filesModified": ["/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js"],
  "registrationAdded": "this.commandHandlers.set('autoFitItem', this.autoFitItem.bind(this));",
  "methodAdded": true,
  "tested": false,
  "notes": "This command directly calls StationUI.autoFitItem() which will trigger the bug where 'fitting' is undefined (returned from getShipFitting(this.currentShipId)) because StationUI.currentShipId='player_ship_1' but ShipFittingManager expects 'player'. The command validates that the ship is docked, StationUI is available, the item exists, and the item is in inventory before calling autoFitItem()."
}
```

**Implementation Summary:**

I've successfully added the `autoFitItem` command to GameTestingInterface.js. This command:

1. **Validates prerequisites**: Ship must be docked, StationUI must be available, item must exist and be in inventory
2. **Calls StationUI.autoFitItem(itemId) directly**: This reproduces the exact double-click behavior that triggers the bug
3. **Will trigger the bug**: When called, it will hit the undefined 'hull' property error at StationUI.js:1605 because:
   - StationUI.autoFitItem() uses `this.currentShipId` which is 'player_ship_1'
   - ShipFittingManager.getShipFitting() expects 'player' as the ship ID
   - Returns undefined for the wrong ship ID
   - Line 1605 tries to access `fitting.hull.baseStats.slots` causing "Cannot read properties of undefined"

The command is now available for automated testing and will properly reproduce the ship fitting auto-fit bug.
