## Analysis

**Test Status**: ❌ **FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction script executed successfully through 5 of 10 test steps before encountering a framework-level issue:

### What Happened
1. ✅ Environment setup successful (HTTP server, Chrome launch, WebSocket)
2. ✅ Game initialized and WebSocket connected
3. ✅ Completed steps 1-5:
   - Wait for initialization
   - Debug environment (6 stations found)
   - Get ship state
   - Create test station at (5000, 0, 0)
   - Teleport to (7000, 0, 0) - **completed but failed validation**
4. ❌ Chrome disconnected immediately after teleportation
5. ❌ Test never reached the auto-fit step where the bug would be triggered

### Framework Issue
- **Unexpected Chrome exit** (exit code 1) after teleportation command
- WebSocket disconnected with code 1006 (abnormal closure)
- Console logs show only GCM authentication errors (unrelated to game logic)
- The bug-specific TypeError was **not reproduced** because test didn't reach autoFitItem step

### Evidence Quality
✅ Console log file captured: `chrome_debug.log` (28,340 lines)  
✅ 5 console errors logged (GCM authentication issues)  
❌ Bug-specific errors NOT captured (test incomplete)  
❌ Evidence status: `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

### Root Cause Analysis
The evidence file documents the **actual bug's root cause**:
> "Ship ID mismatch between StationUI (player_ship_1) and ShipFittingManager (player)"

However, this could not be validated because the test infrastructure failed before reaching the autoFitItem operation.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
