Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and is well-structured. Let me verify it's complete and ready:

## ✅ Reproduction Script Analysis

The script **`test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`** is **already complete and ready to execute**. Here's what it does:

### Test Scenario (defineScenario function - lines 50-223)

1. **Wait for initialization** (2 seconds)
2. **Debug environment** - Check if stations exist
3. **Check for existing stations** - Find nearby stations (100km range)
4. **Create test station** - If no stations exist, create one at (5000, 0, 0)
5. **Teleport near station** - Move within docking range (2km away)
6. **Dock at station** - Required for fitting operations
7. **Add Mining Laser I** to inventory (`mining_laser_1`)
8. **Verify item in inventory** - Confirm item was added
9. **Auto-fit item** - 🐛 **THIS IS WHERE THE BUG OCCURS**
   - Calls `autoFitItem` command (simulates double-click)
   - If bug exists: TypeError will be thrown and caught
   - If bug fixed: Item will be auto-fitted successfully
10. **Verify fitted items** - Check if item was actually fitted to ship

### Bug Detection Logic

**Two possible outcomes:**

1. **Bug Reproduced** (lines 330-337):
   - `autoFitItem` command throws TypeError
   - Console shows: 🐛 BUG REPRODUCED!
   - Evidence status: `BUG_REPRODUCED`

2. **Bug Fixed** (lines 357-360):
   - All tests pass without errors
   - Item is successfully fitted to high slot
   - Evidence status: `BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED`

### Evidence Collection

The script collects:
- All command responses
- Console logs from Chrome (including TypeError and Quantum Universe errors)
- Error counts
- Timestamps
- Full test execution trace

### Key Features

✅ **Proper variable naming** - Uses `testClientServer` (server-side) and `testClient` (client-side)  
✅ **Dynamic params** - Station position is calculated dynamically  
✅ **Error handling** - Catches TypeError from autoFitItem  
✅ **Console log parsing** - Searches for specific errors mentioned in bug report  
✅ **Comprehensive evidence** - Saves all data to JSON file  

## Ready to Execute

The script is **complete and ready to run**. It will:
1. Launch Chrome with the game
2. Set up test scenario (dock, add item to inventory)
3. Attempt auto-fit (will trigger bug if it exists)
4. Collect evidence (console logs, errors, test results)
5. Save evidence to `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`

**DECISION: script_ready**
