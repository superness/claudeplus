### Key Findings

1. **Script Executed Successfully**: The reproduction script ran and collected evidence
2. **Test Environment Limitation**: The test could not fully execute because **no stations exist in the game world**
3. **Evidence Collected**: Console logs captured successfully (5 entries, 5 errors)
4. **Test Incomplete**: The script marked status as "BUG_REPRODUCED" but with the caveat that it couldn't test docking

### Issue Identified

The reproduction test hit a **framework limitation**: The game world doesn't have any stations spawned by default. The test sequence requires:
1. Find nearest station ❌ (failed - no stations found)
2. Dock at station (blocked)
3. Add item to inventory (blocked)
4. Auto-fit item (blocked)

The test needs the game world to have stations available, or the test needs to create a station programmatically before running the auto-fit test.
