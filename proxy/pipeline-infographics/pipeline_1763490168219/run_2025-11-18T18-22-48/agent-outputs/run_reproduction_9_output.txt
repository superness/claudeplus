## Key Findings

**Test Execution Status**: ✅ Script executed successfully, but encountered framework limitation

**Framework Error Identified**: The reproduction script couldn't complete its test sequence because the game world doesn't have any stations. The auto-fit functionality requires the player to be docked at a station, but the test found 0 stations within range.

**Evidence Details**:
- ✅ Console logs captured (5 entries - all Chrome internal errors, no game errors)
- ✅ Evidence file generated with complete test data
- ✅ Root cause documented: "Ship ID mismatch between StationUI (player_ship_1) and ShipFittingManager (player)"
- ❌ Test couldn't proceed beyond step 1 (finding a station)

**Console Errors Note**: The 5 console errors are Chrome's internal GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) registration failures - these are not related to the game or the bug being tested.

**Next Steps Needed**: The test infrastructure needs modification to either:
1. Create stations at game initialization when in test mode, OR
2. Modify the reproduction script to use a different testing approach that doesn't require docking

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
