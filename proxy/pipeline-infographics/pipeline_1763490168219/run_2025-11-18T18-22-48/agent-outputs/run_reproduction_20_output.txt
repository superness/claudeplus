### Analysis

**Test Result**: The reproduction script encountered a **framework error** before reaching the actual bug test.

**What Happened**:
1. ✅ Environment setup successful (HTTP server, Chrome launch, WebSocket connection)
2. ✅ Game initialization successful (6 stations found)
3. ✅ Test station creation successful (`station_7` created at position 5000,0,0)
4. ❌ **Teleport command caused game disconnect** (`setPosition` to 7000,0,0)
5. ❌ Test could not proceed to docking, inventory operations, or auto-fit testing

**Root Cause of Framework Error**:
- The `setPosition` command took 4.3 seconds to execute, suggesting it may have triggered an error in the game
- Game immediately disconnected after the teleport (WebSocket code 1006)
- Test never reached the docking or auto-fit phases where the actual bug occurs

**Console Logs**:
- Only Chrome GCM/authentication errors found (unrelated to the bug)
- No evidence of the reported errors:
  - ❌ "Quantum Universe error: Script error." (QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715)
  - ❌ "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull')" (StationUI.js:1605)

**Evidence Captured**:
- ✅ Console log file: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`
- ✅ All command responses saved
- ✅ Station and ship state captured
- ❌ Bug-specific errors not captured (test didn't reach that phase)

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The test infrastructure encountered an issue with the teleport operation that prevented the test from reaching the auto-fit bug. The game disconnected before we could test docking → adding items to inventory → double-clicking to auto-fit. This is a test framework issue, not a bug reproduction result.
