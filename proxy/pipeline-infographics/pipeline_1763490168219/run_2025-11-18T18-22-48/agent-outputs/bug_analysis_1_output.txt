Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create the bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship fitting auto-fit fails with 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' when double-clicking inventory items",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a user double-clicks an item in their inventory, the item should be automatically fitted to the first available slot of the appropriate type on their ship",
  "actualBehavior": "Double-clicking an inventory item triggers two errors: 1) 'Quantum Universe error: Script error.' at QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715 (global error handler), and 2) 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' at StationUI.js:1605 in the autoFitItem function",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship_fitting", "UI", "inventory_management"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a browser",
    "Step 2: Navigate to a station and dock",
    "Step 3: Open the station UI showing inventory items",
    "Step 4: Double-click any fittable item in the inventory",
    "Step 5: Observe console errors instead of item being fitted"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/StationUI.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Ship ID mismatch between StationUI and ShipFittingManager. StationUI.js:885 initializes currentShipId as 'player_ship_1', but ShipFittingManager.js:19 uses 'player' as the playerShipId (as per the bug fix comment on line 17-18). When autoFitItem calls getShipFitting(this.currentShipId) with 'player_ship_1', it returns undefined because no fitting exists for that ID. The code then tries to access fitting.hull.baseStats.slots at line 1605, causing the TypeError. This is a known issue that was previously fixed in ShipFittingManager but the fix was not propagated to StationUI's initialization."
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The bug is caused by a **ship ID mismatch** between two components:

1. **ShipFittingManager** (line 19): Uses `'player'` as the player ship ID
   - Comment on lines 17-18 explicitly states this was a bug fix to match the ID from SpaceshipSimulator.js:601
   
2. **StationUI** (line 885): Uses `'player_ship_1'` as the current ship ID
   - This was never updated when the ShipFittingManager bug fix was applied

**Error Flow:**
1. User double-clicks item (line 1450)
2. `autoFitItem(item.itemId)` is called (line 1597)
3. `getShipFitting(this.currentShipId)` is called with `'player_ship_1'` (line 1601)
4. ShipFittingManager returns `undefined` because it only has a fitting for `'player'`
5. Code tries to access `fitting.hull.baseStats.slots` (line 1605) on undefined
6. TypeError is thrown, caught by global error handler (QuantumUniverseIntegration.js:715)

**Fix Required:**
Change `StationUI.js` line 885 from `this.currentShipId = 'player_ship_1';` to `this.currentShipId = 'player';` to match the ShipFittingManager's player ship ID.
