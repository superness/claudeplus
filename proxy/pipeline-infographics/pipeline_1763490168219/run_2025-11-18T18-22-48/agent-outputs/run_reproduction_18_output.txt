## Analysis

The reproduction script executed successfully through the setup phase but **failed to reach the bug reproduction step** due to a framework issue:

### What Happened
1. ✅ Environment setup completed (HTTP server, Chrome launch)
2. ✅ Test station created at (5000, 0, 0)
3. ✅ Ship teleported to (7000, 0, 0) - 2km from station
4. ❌ **Game disconnected** before docking step
5. ❌ Never reached auto-fit step where bug would be reproduced

### Framework Issue
- **Game WebSocket disconnected** with code 1006 (abnormal closure)
- Occurred immediately after the `setPosition` (teleport) command
- Console errors are Chrome internal (GCM push notification failures - unrelated to game)
- No game-specific errors captured

### Bug Not Tested
The auto-fit bug **could not be reproduced** because the test never reached:
- Docking at station
- Adding Mining Laser I to inventory
- Calling `autoFitItem` (where TypeError occurs)

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
