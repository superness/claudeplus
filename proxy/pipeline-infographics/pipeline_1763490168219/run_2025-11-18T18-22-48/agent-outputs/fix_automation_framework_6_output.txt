Perfect! The script now has the necessary framework fixes:

1. **First step**: Finds nearest station using `getShipState` with a 100km search radius
2. **Second step**: Uses `dynamicParams` to teleport the player 2km from the station (within docking range)
3. **Third step**: Docks at the station (now guaranteed to be in range)
4. **Rest of test**: Continues as before to test auto-fit functionality

Let me create a summary document explaining the framework fix:

## Framework Fix Summary

The reproduction test framework has been enhanced to handle the docking prerequisite properly:

### Problem
The test failed before reaching the actual bug because the player ship spawned too far from any station (beyond the 10km docking range required by the `dock` command).

### Solution
Added three new capabilities to the test framework:

1. **Station Discovery Step**: Added initial `getShipState` command with 100km range to find all stations in the game world and identify the nearest one.

2. **Dynamic Parameters Support**: Implemented `dynamicParams` function support that allows test commands to compute their parameters at runtime based on previous test results (stored in the `evidence` object).

3. **Teleport Step**: Added `setPosition` command with `dynamicParams` that calculates a position 2km from the nearest station (well within the 10km docking range).

### Changes Made
- Modified `test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`:
  - Added station discovery step
  - Added teleport step with dynamic positioning
  - Enhanced command execution to support `dynamicParams` function
  - Updated evidence tracking to record actual params used (not just template params)

### Test Flow (Updated)
1. ✅ Find nearest station (getShipState with 100km range)
2. ✅ Teleport near station (setPosition with dynamic coordinates)
3. ✅ Dock at station (now guaranteed to be in range)
4. Add item to inventory
5. Test auto-fit functionality
6. Verify results

The framework is now ready to retry the reproduction test.
