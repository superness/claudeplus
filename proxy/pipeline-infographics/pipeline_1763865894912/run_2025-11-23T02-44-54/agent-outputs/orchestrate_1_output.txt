The errors are continuous and recent (21:45:47, which is recent). The pool cannot connect to the daemon RPC despite:
1. Daemon running with correct RPC settings
2. RPC accessible via curl
3. Credentials matching

This is a clear RPC connectivity failure that needs recovery. Let me create a comprehensive state assessment:

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

### Current State Assessment:

**Dependencies:**
- bitcoind: Process running (PIDs 38018, 51969) ✓
- CoiniumServ: Binary exists and process running (PID 45147) ✓
- Mining software: NOT installed ✗

**Configurations:**
- Daemon config: Exists at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with correct RPC settings ✓
- Pool config: Exists with matching RPC credentials (user: coiniumtest, pass: testpass123) ✓
- Pool definition: default.json properly configured ✓

**Running Components:**
- Daemon: Running, RPC port 18443 listening, blockchain at height 331 ✓
- Daemon RPC: Verified working via curl test ✓
- Pool: Running, Stratum port 3333 listening ⚠️
- Pool-to-Daemon connection: **FAILING** - "Connection refused" errors ✗

**Identified Issues:**
1. **Critical**: Pool cannot connect to daemon RPC despite both running and daemon being accessible
   - Error: "Connection refused" when trying to call getblocktemplate
   - Daemon RPC works when tested directly with curl
   - This suggests either:
     a) Mono/.NET HTTP client networking issue
     b) Firewall/routing issue specific to the pool process
     c) RPC bind configuration issue (daemon bound to 127.0.0.1, pool trying to connect)

2. **Missing**: No mining software (cpuminer/minerd) installed

### Gap Analysis:

**Immediate blocker**: Pool-Daemon RPC connectivity failure preventing getblocktemplate, which means no mining jobs can be created.

**Next gap**: Miner software not installed (but this is blocked by pool connectivity issue anyway)

### Failure Pattern:
Recent logs show continuous "Connection refused" errors from JobManager when trying to create new jobs via getblocktemplate. This is a persistent failure requiring recovery intervention.

## ROUTING DECISION

The infrastructure has partial setup:
- Daemon running and healthy ✓
- Pool running but cannot communicate with daemon ✗
- Miner not installed ✗

This is a **recovery scenario** where an existing component (pool) is running but failing to function properly due to RPC connectivity issues. The recovery agent should:
1. Diagnose the RPC connection failure
2. Attempt fixes (restart pool, check networking, verify RPC bind settings)
3. If recovery successful, then we can proceed to miner setup
4. If recovery fails, may need to regenerate configs or escalate

REASONING:
Current state shows both daemon and pool processes running with ports listening, but pool JobManager cannot establish RPC connection to daemon despite correct credentials and daemon being accessible via curl. This is a classic infrastructure failure requiring the error_recovery_agent to diagnose and fix the RPC connectivity issue between pool and daemon. The daemon is healthy and verified working, so the issue is specifically with pool-to-daemon communication. Recovery must fix this before we can proceed to miner setup and validation.

Dependencies for recovery action: Both components running (satisfied), configs exist (satisfied), just need to fix connectivity.
