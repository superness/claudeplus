Now I have a complete understanding. Let me create the comprehensive plan for building the pool-bug-fix pipeline:

---

**UNDERSTANDING:** User wants to create a pool-bug-fix.json pipeline template file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This pipeline is specifically for fixing CoiniumServ mining pool bugs with reproduction via the mining cycle. The pipeline has 7 defined stages that follow a bug fix workflow with mining cycle integration for both bug reproduction and validation.

**APPROACH:** I will create a comprehensive JSON pipeline template following the established pattern from existing templates (pool-feature-development.json and bug-fix-v1.json). The pipeline will integrate CoiniumServ pool bug fixing with real mining cycle validation (daemon → pool → miner workflow). I'll structure it with proper stages array, success criteria, transitions, configuration sections, environment variables, and metadata following the conventions observed in the existing templates.

**STEPS:**
1) Read section 3.3 lines 591-606 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract exact stage specifications
2) Create JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, version, description, category)
   - 7 stages array based on specification: analyze_bug, reproduce_with_mining, verify_bug, implement_fix, validate_with_cycle, regression_check, bug_fix_verified
   - Each stage with appropriate agents (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
   - Actions array for each stage with specific commands and parameters
   - Success criteria for each stage
   - Transitions mapping stage outcomes to next stages
   - Pipeline_config section with CoiniumServ-specific settings
   - Bug_fix_config section with mining infrastructure parameters
   - Environment_variables section defining required/generated variables
   - Retry_configuration for handling failures
   - Failure_handling strategies for different error types
   - Artifact_management for preserving bug reports, logs, evidence
   - Metadata section with tags, complexity, requirements
3) Follow the JSON structure patterns from pool-feature-development.json:
   - Use detailed action objects with agent, command, params, timeout_seconds
   - Include transitions with multiple outcomes (bug_confirmed/not_reproduced/inconclusive)
   - Add comprehensive configuration sections for mining cycle integration
   - Include validation thresholds and quality gates
   - Add environment variable definitions with descriptions
4) Incorporate bug-fix workflow patterns from bug-fix-v1.json:
   - Evidence-based verification approach
   - Proper reproduction before fix implementation
   - Validation after fix implementation
   - Regression checking
   - Test artifact collection
5) Write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json

**TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:** The pipeline must handle:
- Bug reproduction failures (cannot reproduce) → transition to END or different approach
- Mining infrastructure errors → transition to error_recovery or retry
- Bug verification inconclusive results → loop back to reproduce_with_mining
- Fix implementation that doesn't resolve bug → loop back to implement_fix
- Regression test failures → loop back to implement_fix
- Various timeout scenarios for mining operations (block discovery can take time even in regtest)
- Cases where automated reproduction via mining cycle isn't possible

**EVIDENCE:** I will create a complete JSON file that:
- Contains exactly 7 stages as specified in section 3.3
- Uses appropriate agents: task_planner for analysis, cycle_integration_tester for mining cycle operations, proof_validator for verification, task_executor for implementation
- Includes comprehensive configuration sections for CoiniumServ and mining infrastructure
- Follows established JSON structure patterns from existing templates
- Is valid JSON with proper syntax
- Saves to the specified path: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json

**CONFIDENCE:** High - I have clear specifications from section 3.3 (lines 591-606), two excellent reference templates showing established patterns, and a well-defined 7-stage workflow. The task is straightforward: create a JSON file combining the bug-fix workflow with mining cycle integration using the documented structure patterns.
