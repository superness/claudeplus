UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-bug-fix pipeline JSON file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 7 stages for fixing CoiniumServ bugs using mining cycle reproduction, with specific stage transitions and Claude instance assignments.

APPROACH: First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications, then design the JSON structure following the pipeline stages and transitions provided, ensuring proper agent assignments (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor) at each stage.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.3 specifications and any existing pipeline JSON format examples
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON structure and format
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema (fields like stages, transitions, agents, prompts, etc.)
4) Design the JSON structure with:
   - 7 stages as specified: analyze_bug, reproduce_with_mining, verify_bug, implement_fix, validate_with_cycle, regression_check, bug_fix_verified
   - Proper transitions between stages (analyze_bug → task_planner → reproduce_with_mining, etc.)
   - Agent assignments for each stage (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
   - Appropriate prompts/instructions for each stage related to bug fixing and mining cycle integration
   - END condition at bug_fix_verified stage
5) Create the complete JSON content following the discovered schema
6) Verify the JSON structure includes all necessary fields and follows the pattern from existing templates

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates in the same directory
- Will ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent assignments
- Will validate stage transitions form a proper workflow from analyze_bug to bug_fix_verified
- Will check that cycle_integration_tester is used for mining-related stages (reproduce_with_mining, validate_with_cycle, regression_check)
- Will ensure the END transition is properly configured at bug_fix_verified stage

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the content of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will show examples of existing pipeline JSON structure from the templates directory
- Will present the complete designed JSON with all 7 stages, transitions, and agent assignments
- Will demonstrate how each stage connects to form the bug-fix workflow

CONFIDENCE: Medium - Need to read the source documentation and existing templates to understand the exact JSON schema and requirements. The stage flow is clearly specified, but the detailed structure depends on the existing template format and section 3.3 specifications.
