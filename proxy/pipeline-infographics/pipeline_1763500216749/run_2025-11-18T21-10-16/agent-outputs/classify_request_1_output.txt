I need to analyze this request to classify it correctly.

Looking at the user's request:
- Reports a **previously attempted fix did NOT work** - the bug still exists
- Describes specific broken behavior: instant direction change, instant throttle response, no acceleration curve
- Requires investigation of why previous fix failed
- Needs to find the REAL root cause
- Requires implementation of a proper fix
- Includes verification/testing requirements

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** request because:
1. **Primary indicator**: "bug fix... did NOT actually resolve the issue" - something is broken
2. **Broken behavior described**: Instant movement instead of EVE-style physics curves
3. **Previous fix attempt failed**: The velocity plain object fix didn't work
4. **Investigation needed**: Why the fix failed and what the real root cause is
5. **Fix required**: Restore proper EVE-style physics with acceleration curves

This is NOT a:
- QUICK_CHANGE: Requires investigation, testing, and potentially complex fixes
- FEATURE_REQUEST: Not asking for new functionality, asking to restore existing physics
- REFACTOR: Not about code improvement, about fixing broken behavior
- QUESTION: Not asking for information, asking for a bug to be fixed
