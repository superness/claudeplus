CORE_CONCEPT: A classic two-player checkers (draughts) board game where players capture opponent pieces by jumping over them diagonally
PLAYER_EXPERIENCE: Strategic turn-based gameplay where players move pieces diagonally, plan multi-jump captures, and work to king their pieces while preventing the opponent from doing the same

SYSTEMS_REQUIRED:
1. Board System
   PURPOSE: Manage the 8x8 game board and valid tile positions
   DEPENDENCIES: None (core system)
   CORE_MECHANICS: Grid representation, tile coloring (only dark squares used), coordinate mapping, board state serialization
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Board dimensions, tile states (empty/red/black/king), valid playable squares (32 dark tiles)

2. Piece System
   PURPOSE: Define and manage game pieces and their properties
   DEPENDENCIES: Board System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Piece types (regular/king), piece ownership (red/black player), piece placement, piece removal on capture
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Piece position, piece type, piece owner, captured piece counts

3. Movement System
   PURPOSE: Handle all piece movement rules and validation
   DEPENDENCIES: Board System, Piece System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Diagonal movement (forward for regular, any direction for kings), single-tile moves, move validation, turn enforcement
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Current position, target position, piece type (for direction rules), board state for obstacle checking

4. Capture System
   PURPOSE: Implement jumping/capturing mechanics
   DEPENDENCIES: Movement System, Piece System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Jump detection, mandatory capture rules, multi-jump chains, piece removal after capture
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Adjacent opponent pieces, landing squares availability, chain jump possibilities

5. King Promotion System
   PURPOSE: Promote pieces that reach the opposite end of the board
   DEPENDENCIES: Movement System, Piece System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Back-row detection, piece transformation to king, visual king indicator
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Piece position (row check), promotion eligibility

6. Turn System
   PURPOSE: Manage alternating player turns and turn rules
   DEPENDENCIES: Movement System, Capture System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Turn alternation, forced capture enforcement, turn completion detection, multi-jump turn continuation
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Current player, available moves, mandatory captures flag

7. Win Condition System
   PURPOSE: Detect game end states and determine winner
   DEPENDENCIES: Piece System, Movement System, Turn System
   CORE_MECHANICS: No pieces remaining check, no valid moves check, stalemate detection, winner declaration
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Piece counts per player, available moves per player

8. Input System
   PURPOSE: Handle player piece selection and move input
   DEPENDENCIES: Board System, Movement System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Piece selection, valid move highlighting, move confirmation, deselection
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Selected piece, highlighted valid moves, click/touch coordinates

9. Rendering System
   PURPOSE: Display the game board, pieces, and UI elements
   DEPENDENCIES: Board System, Piece System
   CORE_MECHANICS: Board drawing, piece rendering, king indicators, selection highlighting, capture animation, turn indicator
   DATA_REQUIREMENTS: Board state, piece positions, selected piece, valid moves to highlight, current player

SYSTEM_INTERACTIONS:
```
Input System → Movement System → Capture System
                    ↓                 ↓
              Turn System ←──────────┘
                    ↓
           King Promotion System

             Rendering System ← Board System ← Piece System
```

- Input System triggers Movement System when player selects and moves
- Movement System validates with Capture System for mandatory jumps
- Capture System feeds back to Turn System (multi-jump continuation)
- Turn System triggers King Promotion check after move completion
- Win Condition System checks after each turn completion
- Rendering System observes all state changes and updates display

DESIGN_PRIORITIES:
1. Board System (foundation - no dependencies)
2. Piece System (requires board)
3. Movement System (core gameplay)
4. Capture System (core gameplay)
5. Turn System (game flow)
6. King Promotion System (progression mechanic)
7. Win Condition System (game completion)
8. Input System (player interaction)
9. Rendering System (visual feedback)

DECISION: design_complete
