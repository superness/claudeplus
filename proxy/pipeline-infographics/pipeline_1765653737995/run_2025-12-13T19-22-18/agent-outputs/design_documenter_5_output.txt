I have written the comprehensive game design document to `design-docs/game-design.md`. The document includes:

- **Overview**: Core concept, player experience, and American Checkers variant specification
- **9 Complete Systems**: Board, Piece, Movement, Capture, Turn, King Promotion, Win Condition, Input, and Rendering systems
- **Each system contains**: Purpose, dependencies, core mechanics, and data requirements with JavaScript code examples
- **System Interactions**: ASCII diagram showing how all systems connect and the event flow
- **Implementation Priority**: Ordered list for building the systems
- **Technical Notes**: Key formulas, board layout details, and color palette specifications

The document provides everything needed for the feature implementer to build a fully functional checkers game.
