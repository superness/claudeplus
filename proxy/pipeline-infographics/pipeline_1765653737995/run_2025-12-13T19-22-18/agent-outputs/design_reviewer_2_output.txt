VALIDATION_REPORT
==================

DOCUMENT_SUMMARY:
- Design Name: Checkers (Draughts) Game
- Systems Count: 9
- Validation Date: 2025-12-13
- Overall Status: NEEDS_REVISION

COMPLETENESS_VERIFICATION:

1. SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE ✗
   [Check each system has:]
   ☑ Purpose clearly defined
   ☑ Player interaction specified
   ☐ Core mechanics detailed - PARTIAL (formulas missing)
   ☐ Data model defined - INCOMPLETE (structures not specified)
   ☐ Rules & formulas provided - MISSING
   ☐ Integration points mapped - PARTIAL
   ☐ Edge cases addressed - MISSING
   
   Missing/Incomplete:
   - No concrete data structures (just field names listed)
   - No coordinate system specification (0-indexed? algebraic notation?)
   - No explicit formulas for diagonal movement validation
   - No edge case handling (draw conditions, time limits)

2. SYSTEM INTERACTIONS ✓
   ☑ All system connections documented
   ☑ Data flow clearly mapped
   ☑ Event triggers specified
   ☑ No circular dependencies unhandled
   
   Issues: None - interaction diagram is clear

3. DATA MODELS ✗
   ☐ All systems have defined data structures
   ☐ Data types specified
   ☐ Relationships between entities clear
   ☐ No orphaned data references
   
   Issues:
   - DATA_REQUIREMENTS lists field names but not actual data structures
   - No TypeScript/JS interfaces or object shapes defined
   - No specification of how board state is stored (2D array? map?)
   - Piece entity structure not defined (just properties listed)

4. IMPLEMENTATION READINESS ✗
   ☐ Sufficient detail for coding - NO
   ☐ No ambiguous requirements - Several ambiguities exist
   ☐ Formulas are complete - NO formulas provided
   ☐ Implementation roadmap logical - YES
   
   Issues:
   - How exactly to validate a diagonal move? (formula needed)
   - Which checkers variant? (standard American 8x8 vs international 10x10)
   - Mandatory capture enforcement details missing
   - No specification of starting piece positions

CONSISTENCY_CHECKS:

- Input System → Movement System: ✓ Clear
- Movement System → Capture System: ✓ Clear
- Capture System → Turn System: ✓ Clear
- Turn System → King Promotion: ✓ Clear
- Win Condition trigger: ✓ Clear
- Rendering observation: ✓ Clear

Issues Found: None in system flow

IMPLEMENTATION_PROOF:

✓ CAN IMPLEMENT: System Interaction Flow
  Evidence: The dependency graph and event flow are well-documented
  
✓ CAN IMPLEMENT: Turn alternation logic
  Evidence: Turn System clearly describes alternation and forced capture
  
✗ CANNOT IMPLEMENT: Board initialization
  Blocker: No starting position specification
  Required: Initial piece placement (which rows, which squares)
  
✗ CANNOT IMPLEMENT: Diagonal movement validation
  Blocker: No formula for determining valid diagonal moves
  Required: Mathematical formula like: validDiagonal = |targetX - currentX| === |targetY - currentY| === 1
  
✗ CANNOT IMPLEMENT: Capture detection
  Blocker: No formula for jump validation
  Required: Jump formula: jumped piece at (x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2, landing at distance 2 diagonal
  
✗ CANNOT IMPLEMENT: Piece data structure
  Blocker: No concrete entity definition
  Required: Interface like { id, x, y, owner: 'red'|'black', isKing: boolean }

VERIFIABLE_OUTPUTS:

1. System List: 9 systems with clear purposes ✓
2. Dependency Order: Prioritized implementation roadmap ✓
3. Interaction Diagram: ASCII flow diagram provided ✓
4. Data Model Definitions: NOT PROVIDED ✗
5. Movement Formulas: NOT PROVIDED ✗
6. Initial Board State: NOT PROVIDED ✗
7. Game Rules Specification: Variant not specified ✗

CRITICAL_GAPS:

1. **Missing Data Structures**
   Impact: Cannot implement any system without knowing object shapes
   Recommendation: Add concrete interfaces:
   ```javascript
   Tile: { x: number, y: number, piece: Piece | null }
   Piece: { id: string, owner: 'red'|'black', isKing: boolean }
   GameState: { board: Tile[][], currentPlayer: 'red'|'black', ... }
   ```

2. **Missing Movement Formulas**
   Impact: Cannot validate moves programmatically
   Recommendation: Add:
   - Diagonal validation: `Math.abs(dx) === Math.abs(dy) === 1` for regular moves
   - Jump validation: `Math.abs(dx) === Math.abs(dy) === 2` with enemy piece in between
   - Direction rules: Red moves +y (forward), Black moves -y (forward), Kings move both

3. **Missing Initial Setup**
   Impact: Cannot start a game
   Recommendation: Specify:
   - Red pieces: rows 0-2, dark squares only (12 pieces)
   - Black pieces: rows 5-7, dark squares only (12 pieces)
   - Rows 3-4: empty

4. **Missing Game Variant Specification**
   Impact: Ambiguous rules
   Recommendation: Explicitly state "American Checkers (8x8 board, 12 pieces per player, mandatory capture)"

FINAL_VERDICT:

**NEEDS_REVISION**

REASONING: The design provides excellent high-level architecture with clear system separation and interaction flow. However, it lacks the concrete implementation details necessary to write code: no data structures, no formulas, no initial state, and no explicit game variant. A developer would need to make many assumptions to implement this, which could lead to bugs or rule violations.

NEXT_STEPS:
Add the following to the design document:
1. Concrete data structure definitions (Board, Tile, Piece, GameState interfaces)
2. Mathematical formulas for diagonal movement and jump validation
3. Initial board setup specification (starting positions)
4. Explicit game variant declaration (American Checkers 8x8)
5. Edge cases: draw conditions (40 moves without capture = draw), piece selection rules when multiple captures available
