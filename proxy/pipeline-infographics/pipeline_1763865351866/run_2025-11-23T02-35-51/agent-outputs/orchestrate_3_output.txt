## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Discovered**:

✅ **Daemon Status**: 
- Running (PIDs: 38018, 49833)
- Process: `bitcoind -regtest -daemon`
- Config: exists at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

❌ **Pool Status**: 
- Not running
- Config: exists at /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json

❌ **Network Ports**:
- Neither RPC port 18443 nor Stratum port 3333 are listening
- This suggests daemon may be starting but RPC not fully initialized yet

⚠️ **Dependencies**:
- bitcoind: installed and running
- bitcoin-cli: not found (command not available)
- Mono: needs verification
- cpuminer: needs verification

## Analysis & Decision

The infrastructure is **partially set up**:

1. **Daemon is running** but RPC accessibility is uncertain (bitcoin-cli not found, ports not showing as listening)
2. **Configs exist** for both daemon and pool (previous setup detected)
3. **Pool is not running** - this is the critical missing component
4. **Dependencies unclear** - bitcoin-cli missing suggests incomplete Bitcoin Core installation or PATH issues

**Identified Gap**: The Bitcoin daemon appears to be running, but:
- RPC port (18443) is not listening according to netstat
- bitcoin-cli is not available to verify daemon health
- Pool cannot be started until daemon RPC is confirmed working

**Root Issue**: Cannot verify daemon is fully operational without RPC access. The daemon process is running, but we need to confirm:
- RPC is accepting connections
- Blockchain is synchronized
- Wallet is funded

**Next Action**: Must validate daemon health before proceeding to pool setup. However, we cannot use bitcoin-cli (not available). Need to either:
1. Attempt pool setup (it will fail if daemon RPC isn't ready, triggering recovery)
2. Check daemon logs to verify RPC initialization
3. Verify RPC port another way

Since configs exist and daemon is running, the most efficient path is to **attempt pool setup**. If the pool fails to connect to daemon RPC, it will trigger recovery, which will properly diagnose and fix the daemon RPC issue.

DECISION: delegate_pool_setup

REASONING:
Infrastructure partially operational - daemon process running with existing configs, but pool not running. Skipping dependency check and config generation since configs already exist. Daemon process is running (PIDs 38018, 49833), so skipping daemon setup. Pool is the critical missing component - it should be able to connect to daemon if RPC is ready. If daemon RPC is not ready, pool startup will fail and trigger recovery to properly diagnose and resolve the issue. This is more efficient than manually checking each daemon component when we have an intelligent recovery system.
