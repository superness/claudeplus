## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment**:

✅ **Dependencies**: 
- Mono runtime installed (`/usr/bin/mono`)
- Bitcoin Core appears to be running (2 processes: PIDs 38018, 46812)
- cpuminer status: unknown (need to verify)

✅ **Configurations**:
- Daemon config exists: `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (RPC user: coiniumtest, RPC port: 18443)
- Pool main config exists: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json`
- Pool coin configs exist: `bitcoin.json`, `default.json`

⚠️ **Daemon Status**:
- Bitcoin daemon processes running (2 PIDs detected)
- Daemon logs show recent activity (block height 331, last update 31 minutes ago)
- RPC CLI tool (`bitcoin-cli`) NOT found in PATH (cannot verify RPC accessibility directly)
- Potential stale tip warning detected in logs

❌ **Pool Status**:
- Pool NOT running (CoiniumServ process not found)
- Ports 18443 and 3333 NOT in use (daemon RPC may not be listening, Stratum definitely not listening)

❌ **Validation**:
- Cannot verify RPC connection without bitcoin-cli
- Pool not operational
- End-to-end flow not validated

**Infrastructure Gaps Identified**:

1. **bitcoin-cli missing from PATH** - cannot verify daemon RPC functionality
2. **Daemon RPC port 18443 not listening** - despite processes running, RPC may not be accessible
3. **Pool not running** - needs to be started
4. **cpuminer status unknown** - need to verify installation
5. **Possible daemon stale state** - logs show "potential stale tip detected"

**Dependency Analysis**:

The daemon appears to be running but RPC connectivity is questionable:
- Processes exist but RPC port not listening
- bitcoin-cli not available for verification
- Logs show stale tip warning

This suggests either:
- Daemon crashed and auto-restarted but RPC didn't bind
- Multiple daemon instances running in conflict
- bitcoin-cli installed separately from bitcoind

**Next Action Decision**:

Before proceeding with pool setup, I need to:
1. Verify Bitcoin Core installation completeness (especially bitcoin-cli)
2. Ensure daemon RPC is actually accessible
3. Verify cpuminer installation

This is a **dependency verification** task - the foundation is questionable despite some components existing.

**DECISION: delegate_dependency_check**

**REASONING**:

Although some infrastructure components exist (daemon processes running, configs present), critical dependencies are missing or unverified:

1. **bitcoin-cli not found** - essential for RPC verification and daemon interaction
2. **Daemon RPC port not listening** - despite processes running, cannot confirm RPC accessibility
3. **cpuminer installation unknown** - miner dependency not verified
4. **Potential daemon issues** - stale tip warning suggests daemon may not be healthy

Dependencies must be fully verified and corrected before proceeding with pool setup. The dependency check agent will:
- Verify complete Bitcoin Core installation (bitcoind + bitcoin-cli)
- Confirm Mono runtime (already detected)
- Check for cpuminer availability
- Install/repair any missing components

This ensures a solid foundation before attempting pool startup.
