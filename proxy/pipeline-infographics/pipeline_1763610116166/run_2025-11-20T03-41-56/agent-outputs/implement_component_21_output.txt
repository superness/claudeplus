Excellent! The block-discovery-test pipeline JSON file has been successfully created at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json` (11KB).

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive block-discovery-test pipeline with all 9 stages as specified:

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **setup_infrastructure** → Uses `config_generator` to validate pool and daemon configurations
2. **set_minimal_difficulty** → Uses `config_generator` to configure regtest mode with minimal difficulty (0.0001) for rapid block discovery
3. **start_mining** → Uses `miner_manager` to register test miner and worker, initiate mining
4. **monitor_for_block** → Uses `block_validator` to wait for and validate block discovery (merkle root, coinbase, PoW)
5. **verify_pool_submission** → Uses `block_validator` to confirm block was stored in pool database
6. **verify_daemon_acceptance** → Uses `bitcoin_daemon_manager` to confirm daemon accepted the block and incremented block count
7. **generate_maturity_blocks** → Uses `bitcoin_daemon_manager` to generate 101 blocks for coinbase maturity (regtest requirement)
8. **verify_wallet_credit** → Uses `wallet_manager` to confirm pool wallet received the matured block reward
9. **block_discovery_verified** → Uses `miner_manager` to credit the miner and emit test completion event

### Key Features:

- **Proper dependency chain**: Each stage flows sequentially from infrastructure setup through final verification
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Specific failure handlers for mining timeouts, validation failures, daemon rejection, and wallet credit issues
- **Test-specific configuration**: Regtest mode, minimal difficulty, automatic test address generation
- **Retry logic**: Configurable retries for mining timeouts and validation failures
- **Cleanup procedures**: Automatic cleanup on completion or failure
- **Success metrics**: Tracks all required validations and performance metrics
- **Timeout management**: Appropriate timeouts for each stage (total 900 seconds/15 minutes)

The pipeline follows the exact structure and patterns from existing pipelines in the codebase, ensuring compatibility with the agent framework.
