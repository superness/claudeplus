UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a test pipeline configuration for testing block discovery functionality. The pipeline has 9 stages that test the complete block discovery flow from infrastructure setup through wallet credit verification. The configuration needs to be written as JSON to a specific file path.

APPROACH: 
1. First examine the codebase to understand the existing pipeline structure and JSON schema
2. Look for similar pipeline examples to understand the format and required fields
3. Identify the manager classes referenced (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager)
4. Create a JSON configuration that defines each stage with proper dependencies and manager assignments
5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files: `**/*pipeline*.json` or `**/templates/*.json`
2) Read 2-3 example pipeline files to understand the JSON structure, required fields, and format
3) Use Grep to search for pipeline schema or configuration classes: pattern "pipeline.*schema|PipelineConfig|PipelineStage"
4) Use Grep to find the manager classes to understand their interfaces: pattern "config_generator|miner_manager|block_validator|bitcoin_daemon_manager|wallet_manager"
5) Read the manager class files to understand what parameters/actions each stage might need
6) Construct the JSON with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name: "block-discovery-test", description, version)
   - Array of 9 stages with: stage name, manager assignment, dependencies (based on the → arrows), parameters/configuration
   - Stage 1 (setup_infrastructure) - no dependencies
   - Stage 2 (set_minimal_difficulty) - depends on stage 1
   - Stage 3 (start_mining) - depends on stage 2
   - Stage 4 (monitor_for_block) - depends on stage 3
   - Stage 5 (verify_pool_submission) - depends on stage 4
   - Stage 6 (verify_daemon_acceptance) - depends on stage 5
   - Stage 7 (generate_maturity_blocks) - depends on stage 6
   - Stage 8 (verify_wallet_credit) - depends on stage 7
   - Stage 9 (block_discovery_verified) - depends on stage 8, marks END
7) Write the complete JSON to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json`
8) Read back the written file to verify correct JSON syntax and structure

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will verify the JSON is valid and parseable
- Will ensure all stage dependencies form a valid DAG (no circular dependencies)
- Will check that the pipeline flows correctly from setup through verification
- Will validate that each manager reference matches actual manager classes in codebase
- Will ensure the stages align with typical block discovery testing workflow (setup → mine → verify → mature → credit)

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the complete JSON structure showing all 9 stages
- Will show the dependency chain from setup_infrastructure through block_discovery_verified
- Will confirm file written to correct path with proper JSON formatting
- Will validate against existing pipeline examples for structural consistency

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can identify the pipeline structure from examples and create a well-formed JSON configuration, but confidence is medium because:
1. Need to verify the actual schema/format used in this codebase
2. Manager class parameters may require specific configuration values
3. May need to adjust based on how the codebase actually implements pipeline execution
