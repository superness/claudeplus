ASSESSMENT: 

This plan demonstrates a methodical approach to understanding the codebase before implementation, which is commendable. However, there are several critical weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
- Logical progression: examine existing examples → understand schema → construct new pipeline
- Recognizes the dependency chain structure (stages flow setup → mine → verify)
- Plans to validate JSON syntax and read back the file
- Acknowledges uncertainty appropriately (Medium confidence)

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Vague Evidence Collection**: The plan says "Will provide the complete JSON structure" and "Will show the dependency chain" but doesn't specify HOW this proves the pipeline actually works for block discovery testing. Writing a syntactically valid JSON file ≠ proving the pipeline functions correctly.

2. **No Functional Validation**: The plan focuses entirely on creating a structurally correct JSON file but provides no evidence that:
   - The pipeline can actually be loaded/parsed by the system
   - The manager references are valid and will execute
   - The stages will perform the intended block discovery test operations
   - The pipeline integrates with the actual testing infrastructure

3. **Missing Concrete Verification Steps**: 
   - No plan to test if the pipeline file can be loaded by the pipeline executor
   - No verification that the managers accept the parameters being provided
   - No check if this pipeline format matches what the system expects to consume
   - "Will validate against existing pipeline examples" is too vague - what specific validations?

4. **Schema Uncertainty**: The plan acknowledges needing to "verify the actual schema/format" but doesn't commit to specific verification steps. If the schema is wrong, the entire pipeline will be unusable.

5. **Parameter Speculation**: Step 6 mentions constructing stages with "parameters/configuration" but there's no concrete plan for determining what parameters each manager actually requires. This could result in a pipeline that fails at runtime.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence is primarily structural (file exists, JSON is valid, dependencies form DAG) rather than functional (pipeline executes, stages perform correct operations, block discovery is actually tested). The plan would produce a JSON file but cannot prove it's a working test pipeline.

**What's Missing for Strong Evidence:**
- Verification that the pipeline can be loaded by the pipeline execution system
- Test execution or dry-run validation showing stages are properly configured
- Confirmation that manager methods/parameters align with actual codebase interfaces
- Evidence that the pipeline accomplishes the block discovery testing goal

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the plan shows good research methodology, it focuses on creating a syntactically correct JSON file rather than proving the pipeline will function as a block discovery test. The evidence proposed (file written, JSON valid, structure matches examples) is insufficient to verify the task is actually complete. A stronger plan would include validation steps to prove the pipeline is executable and functional, not just well-formed JSON.
