UNDERSTANDING: User wants a complete test pipeline JSON configuration for testing block discovery functionality in a cryptocurrency mining pool. The pipeline has 9 sequential stages that test the full lifecycle from infrastructure setup through block discovery, submission, acceptance, maturation, and wallet crediting.

APPROACH: I will analyze the existing codebase structure to understand the pipeline format, then create a JSON configuration file that defines each stage with appropriate service assignments, dependencies, and test validation criteria. I'll examine existing pipeline examples to match the expected schema and ensure proper stage ordering and dependency chains.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in the codebase to understand the schema structure: `**/*pipeline*.json` or `**/templates/*.json`
2) Read 1-2 example pipeline files to identify required fields (stage name, service, dependencies, timeout, validation criteria, etc.)
3) Search for references to the services mentioned (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) using Grep to understand their capabilities
4) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions array containing all 9 stages in order
   - Each stage with: id/name, assigned service, dependencies (previous stage), timeout values, success criteria
   - Proper dependency chain: setup → set_difficulty → start_mining → monitor → verify_submission → verify_acceptance → generate_maturity → verify_wallet → end
5) Create validation/assertion fields for critical stages (block found, submitted to pool, accepted by daemon, wallet credited)
6) Add appropriate timeout values for mining operations (longer) vs configuration operations (shorter)
7) Write the complete JSON to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json`

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Pipeline must handle async mining operations with appropriate timeouts
- Each stage should have clear success/failure criteria
- Dependency chain must prevent stages from running out of order
- Block maturity waiting period needs sufficient timeout (typically 100+ blocks)
- Wallet verification should check for expected credit amount
- Should handle edge cases like mining timeout without block discovery
- Each service reference must be valid and callable

EVIDENCE:
- Will examine existing pipeline JSON schema from codebase examples
- Will verify service names match actual service implementations in the code
- Will show the complete JSON structure with all 9 stages properly configured
- Will validate the dependency chain flows correctly from setup through verification
- Will provide the final file path confirmation

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can create a well-structured pipeline JSON based on standard patterns, but without seeing existing pipeline examples in this codebase, I may need to infer the exact schema format. The stage sequence and service assignments are clearly defined, but specific field names, timeout values, and validation syntax may require adjustment based on the actual framework being used.

DECISION: design_complete
