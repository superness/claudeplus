ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding of the user's request to create a block discovery test pipeline JSON
2. Logical exploration approach starting with finding existing pipeline examples
3. Good attempt to identify service manager interfaces and available actions
4. Comprehensive test considerations covering timing, difficulty, maturity blocks, and error scenarios
5. Explicit 9-stage workflow clearly mapped to service managers

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Missing Concrete Evidence Plan**: The designer says "Will show the existing pipeline JSON structure" and "Will provide service manager interface definitions" but these are future promises, not actual evidence. The plan needs to COLLECT this evidence first, then use it to validate the design.

2. **No Schema Validation Evidence**: While mentioning "JSON schema validation," there's no plan to actually show that the generated JSON validates against any discovered schema or matches the pattern of existing pipelines.

3. **Vague Parameter Discovery**: Steps 4-5 mention finding "expected parameters" and "available methods/actions" but don't specify what concrete evidence will prove these are correct. Will there be code snippets? API documentation? Existing pipeline comparisons?

4. **No Verification of Service Manager Existence**: The plan assumes config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, and wallet_manager exist and have the needed actions, but doesn't plan to provide evidence proving this.

5. **Insufficient Completion Proof**: The evidence section says "Will verify file is written to correct location with proper formatting" but doesn't specify HOW this will be verified (file read-back? JSON validation? Comparison with examples?).

6. **Medium Confidence with Significant Unknowns**: The designer admits needing to "first explore the codebase" but rates confidence as Medium. This should be lower given the unknowns, OR the plan should include a discovery phase with concrete evidence collection before claiming design_complete.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is mostly aspirational ("Will show...", "Will provide...", "Will reference...") rather than concrete. A strong evidence plan would specify:
- Exact file paths of discovered pipeline examples
- Code snippets showing service manager action signatures
- Side-by-side comparison of generated JSON vs existing patterns
- JSON schema validation output
- Actual parameter values extracted from codebase constants

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:**
This plan claims "design_complete" but is actually a discovery plan. The designer hasn't yet explored the codebase to understand the pipeline structure, service manager interfaces, or JSON schema. They should execute steps 1-5 FIRST, collect concrete evidence, THEN present a design with that evidence attached. The current plan is a research proposal, not a validated design ready for implementation.

**Required for Approval:**
1. Show actual examples of existing pipeline JSON files from the codebase
2. Provide concrete evidence that all 5 service managers exist and support the required actions
3. Specify exact parameter names/types discovered from the code
4. Include sample JSON snippets showing the correct schema structure
5. Demonstrate validation method for the final JSON file

DECISION: REJECTED
