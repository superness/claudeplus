UNDERSTANDING: User wants a JSON pipeline configuration file for testing block discovery functionality in a cryptocurrency mining pool. The pipeline has 9 sequential stages that test the complete flow from infrastructure setup through block discovery, submission, acceptance, and wallet crediting.

APPROACH: Create a properly structured JSON pipeline configuration that defines each stage with its executor, dependencies, and parameters. The pipeline follows a linear flow where each stage depends on the previous one's success, testing the complete block discovery workflow.

STEPS:
1) Read existing pipeline JSON files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` to understand the schema and structure
2) Examine the codebase to identify the correct executor names (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager)
3) Review similar test pipelines to understand parameter structure and dependency definitions
4) Create the block-discovery-test.json with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - All 9 stages in correct order with proper executors
   - Stage dependencies (each stage depends on previous)
   - Appropriate parameters for each stage (difficulty settings, timeouts, validation criteria)
   - Error handling and timeout configurations
5) Write the complete JSON to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json`
6) Validate JSON syntax is correct

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Pipeline must handle the linear dependency chain correctly (stage 2 waits for stage 1, etc.)
- Each executor must be properly configured to interact with its dependencies
- Timeout values should be appropriate for mining operations (block discovery can take variable time)
- Minimal difficulty setting should ensure blocks can be found in reasonable time for testing
- Maturity block generation should generate enough blocks for coinbase maturity (typically 100+ blocks)
- Error states at any stage should halt the pipeline appropriately
- Verification stages must have clear success/failure criteria

EVIDENCE:
- The created JSON file at the specified path
- Validation that JSON is syntactically correct
- Confirmation that all 9 stages are present with correct executors
- Verification that dependency chain is properly defined
- Review of parameter completeness for each stage

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can create the pipeline structure based on the requirements, but I need to examine existing pipeline files first to ensure I match the exact schema/format used in this codebase. The stage names and executors are clearly specified, but parameter details and exact JSON structure conventions need to be discovered from existing files.
