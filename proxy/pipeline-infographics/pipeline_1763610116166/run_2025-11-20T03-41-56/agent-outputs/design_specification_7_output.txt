UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a test pipeline JSON configuration file for testing block discovery in a mining pool system. The pipeline has 9 sequential stages that test the complete block discovery flow from infrastructure setup through wallet credit verification.

APPROACH: I will examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the structure and format, then create a new pipeline JSON file following the same pattern with the 9 specified stages and their corresponding service managers.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the structure
2) Use Read to examine 1-2 existing pipeline files to determine the JSON schema (fields like name, description, stages array structure, dependencies, service references, etc.)
3) Use Grep to search the codebase for references to the service managers (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) to understand their exact naming and available operations
4) Design the complete pipeline JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stages array with all 9 stages in order
   - Each stage configured with: id, name, service, operation/action, dependencies, timeout, retry logic
   - Stage 1 (setup_infrastructure) has no dependencies
   - Stages 2-9 depend on their predecessor in the chain
   - Stage 9 (block_discovery_verified) marked as terminal/END
5) Write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: The pipeline design must handle:
- Sequential execution flow (each stage waits for previous completion)
- Proper service manager routing for each stage
- Timeout handling for long-running operations (mining, block maturity)
- Retry logic for network-dependent operations (daemon communication)
- Clear success/failure criteria at each stage
- Proper termination at the END stage
- Validation that all required services are available before execution

EVIDENCE: Will collect:
- Screenshots/output of existing pipeline JSON files showing the schema
- List of available service managers and their operations from codebase
- The complete generated block-discovery-test.json file content
- Validation that JSON is properly formatted and parseable

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can see the template directory structure and understand the requirements, but need to examine existing pipeline files to ensure the JSON schema matches the expected format. The stage flow is clear, but the exact JSON structure (field names, nesting, service invocation format) needs to be verified from existing examples.
