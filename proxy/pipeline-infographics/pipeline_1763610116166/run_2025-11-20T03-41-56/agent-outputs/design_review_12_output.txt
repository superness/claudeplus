ASSESSMENT: 

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding of the task: Create a block discovery test pipeline JSON with 9 specific stages
- Logical approach: Examine existing templates → understand schema → design pipeline → write file
- Concrete steps outlined with proper sequencing
- Acknowledges need to discover actual schema from existing files rather than making assumptions
- Identifies relevant components (managers) that need investigation
- Good consideration of test scenarios (timeouts, validation criteria, edge cases)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence specification is vague** - The plan says "will provide examples" and "will display the complete JSON" but doesn't specify HOW to verify the pipeline actually works or is correctly formatted beyond "valid JSON syntax"
2. **Missing validation step** - No mention of validating the created JSON against any schema, testing it can be parsed by the actual pipeline engine, or checking that referenced managers actually exist in the codebase
3. **Incomplete success criteria** - The plan doesn't specify what constitutes proof that the pipeline is "complete" and "correct" - just that it will be written to a file
4. **Manager interface verification weak** - Step 3 mentions searching for manager references but doesn't clearly state what will be done if managers don't exist or have different interfaces than assumed
5. **No fallback strategy** - If no existing pipeline templates are found, the plan mentions "infer a reasonable structure" which is risky without validation

**Critical Missing Evidence:**
- How will we know the pipeline JSON matches the expected schema used by the pipeline execution engine?
- What specific checks will confirm each manager reference is valid?
- How will the dependency chain be verified as executable?
- What happens if the templates directory doesn't exist or has no examples?

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence focuses on "showing the JSON" and "valid JSON syntax" but lacks concrete verification that:
1. The pipeline conforms to the actual schema expected by the execution system
2. All manager references are valid and properly configured
3. The stage dependencies will execute in the correct order
4. The pipeline can actually be loaded/parsed by the pipeline engine

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the plan demonstrates good understanding and a logical approach, it lacks CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE evidence that the created pipeline will actually work. The plan needs to specify:
1. Explicit validation against a schema or by attempting to parse with the pipeline engine
2. Verification that all referenced managers exist in the codebase with expected interfaces
3. Specific checks that the dependency chain is valid and executable
4. Clear success criteria beyond "file is written with valid JSON"

The plan should add a validation phase after writing the file that provides PROOF the pipeline is correctly formatted and references valid components.

DECISION: REJECTED
