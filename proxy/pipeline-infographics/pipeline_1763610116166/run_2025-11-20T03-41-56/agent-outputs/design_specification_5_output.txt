UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a complete test pipeline JSON configuration file for testing block discovery functionality in what appears to be a cryptocurrency mining pool system. The pipeline has 9 stages that flow through different service managers (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) to test the complete block discovery workflow from setup through wallet credit verification.

APPROACH: I will examine the codebase to understand the existing pipeline structure, identify similar pipeline examples, understand the service manager interfaces and their available actions, then design a JSON configuration that properly orchestrates the 9-stage block discovery test workflow with appropriate parameters, dependencies, and validation criteria.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in the codebase to understand the pipeline structure/schema: `**/*pipeline*.json` or `**/templates/*.json`
2) Use Grep to search for service manager implementations to understand available actions: search for "config_generator", "miner_manager", "block_validator", "bitcoin_daemon_manager", "wallet_manager"
3) Read example pipeline files to understand JSON schema including: stage definitions, dependencies, parameters, success criteria, timeout values
4) Use Grep to find block discovery related code to understand expected parameters: search for "block.*discovery", "minimal.*difficulty", "maturity.*blocks"
5) Read relevant service manager code to identify available methods/actions for each stage (setup_infrastructure, set_minimal_difficulty, start_mining, monitor_for_block, verify_pool_submission, verify_daemon_acceptance, generate_maturity_blocks, verify_wallet_credit)
6) Design JSON structure with proper stage sequencing, dependencies (setup_infrastructure → config_generator must complete before set_minimal_difficulty, etc.), and parameters for each service
7) Define success/failure criteria for each stage based on service responses
8) Specify appropriate timeouts for mining operations (likely longer for monitor_for_block stage)
9) Write complete pipeline JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will validate that each stage properly chains to the next with correct dependencies
- Will ensure minimal difficulty setting allows blocks to be found in reasonable time
- Will verify monitoring timeout is sufficient for block discovery at minimal difficulty
- Will confirm maturity block count matches blockchain requirements (typically 100 blocks for Bitcoin-like chains)
- Will handle scenarios where block is found but not accepted by daemon
- Will account for timing issues between pool submission and daemon acceptance
- Will verify wallet credit amount matches expected block reward

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the existing pipeline JSON structure from similar test pipelines
- Will provide service manager interface definitions showing available actions
- Will reference block discovery and maturity constants from the codebase
- Will demonstrate proper JSON schema validation
- Will show the complete pipeline JSON with all 9 stages properly configured
- Will verify file is written to correct location with proper formatting

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to first explore the codebase to understand the pipeline infrastructure, service manager interfaces, and existing patterns. The stage flow is clearly defined, but I need to discover the correct JSON schema, parameter names, and action identifiers used by this system. Once I understand the existing structure, I can create an accurate pipeline configuration.
