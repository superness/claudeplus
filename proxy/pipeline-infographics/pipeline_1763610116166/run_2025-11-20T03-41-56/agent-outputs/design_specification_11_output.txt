UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a block discovery test pipeline JSON file that tests cryptocurrency mining pool block discovery functionality. The pipeline should test the full flow from infrastructure setup through block discovery, submission, maturation, and wallet crediting across 9 stages involving different managers (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager).

APPROACH: I will examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the expected structure, identify the schema/format used, then design a pipeline configuration that orchestrates the 9 stages with proper dependencies, stage configurations, and manager assignments.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the structure
2) Use Read to examine 1-2 example pipeline files to understand the JSON schema (stage definitions, dependencies, manager references, parameters)
3) Use Grep to search the codebase for references to the managers mentioned (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) to understand their expected interfaces/parameters
4) Design the pipeline JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description)
   - Stage definitions for each of the 9 stages
   - Dependencies between stages (setup_infrastructure → config_generator flows to set_minimal_difficulty, etc.)
   - Manager assignments for each stage
   - Required parameters/configuration for each stage
   - Success/failure criteria for validation stages
5) Create the complete JSON following the identified schema
6) Write the JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will ensure the pipeline stages follow the dependency chain correctly (stage 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9)
- Will verify each stage references the correct manager component
- Will include timeout configurations for long-running stages like mining and block maturity
- Will add validation criteria for verification stages (verify_pool_submission, verify_daemon_acceptance, verify_wallet_credit)
- Will consider edge cases like mining failures, daemon connection issues, and wallet verification timeouts
- Will ensure the pipeline can be parsed as valid JSON

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide examples of existing pipeline JSON structures found
- Will show the schema/pattern identified from existing files
- Will display the complete pipeline JSON with all 9 stages properly configured
- Will show the dependency flow diagram from the JSON structure
- Will verify the file is written to the correct path with valid JSON syntax

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can examine existing pipeline structures and create a well-formed JSON, but I need to discover the actual schema format used in this codebase. The confidence depends on finding good example pipelines and understanding how the manager components are referenced/configured. If no existing pipelines exist, I'll need to infer a reasonable structure based on common pipeline patterns.
