UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a test pipeline JSON configuration for testing block discovery in a cryptocurrency mining pool. The pipeline has 9 sequential stages that test the complete block discovery flow from setup through verification of wallet credit. The file should be written to a specific path in the claudeplus templates directory.

APPROACH: I will analyze the provided stage information to understand the pipeline flow, determine the appropriate JSON structure based on similar pipeline configurations in the codebase, identify what parameters and configurations each stage needs, and construct a complete pipeline JSON that follows the project's conventions.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in the codebase to understand the expected structure and format
2) Use Read to examine 1-2 example pipeline files to identify required fields (name, stages, dependencies, parameters, etc.)
3) Search for references to the mentioned components (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) using Grep to understand their expected inputs/outputs
4) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description)
   - Stages array with each of the 9 stages including:
     - Stage name/id
     - Component/handler reference
     - Dependencies (based on the → relationships shown)
     - Input/output parameters
     - Timeout/retry configurations as needed
5) Create the complete JSON following the pattern discovered in step 2
6) Plan to write the file to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- The pipeline must handle sequential execution (each stage depends on previous)
- Must include proper error handling for stage failures
- Should support timeout configurations for long-running stages (mining, monitoring)
- Need to pass block data between stages (discovery → submission → acceptance → maturity → credit)
- Should validate that infrastructure is properly torn down after test completion
- Edge cases: mining timeout without block found, daemon rejection of block, wallet credit verification timeout

EVIDENCE:
- Will identify the exact JSON schema used by existing pipelines in the codebase
- Will show the structure matches other test pipelines in the project
- Will demonstrate that all 9 stages are properly configured with correct dependencies
- Will verify the file path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists or can be created
- Will ensure all component references (config_generator, miner_manager, etc.) align with actual system components

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can find the pipeline structure from existing files and understand the stage flow, but I need to verify the actual component names and parameter structures used by this specific codebase. The sequential nature and clear stage descriptions provide good guidance, but the exact JSON schema and component interfaces need to be discovered from the codebase.

DECISION: design_complete
