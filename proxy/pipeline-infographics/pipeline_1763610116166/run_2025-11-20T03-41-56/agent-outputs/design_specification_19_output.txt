UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a block-discovery-test pipeline JSON configuration file that tests the complete flow of block discovery in a mining pool system, from infrastructure setup through block maturity and wallet verification.

APPROACH: I will examine the existing codebase to understand the pipeline JSON structure, identify similar pipeline examples, understand the component managers referenced (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager), and then create a detailed plan for constructing the block-discovery-test.json file with all 9 stages in proper dependency order.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in the repository to understand the expected structure: `**/*pipeline*.json` or `**/templates/*.json`
2) Use Grep to search for references to the component managers mentioned (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager) to understand their capabilities and parameters
3) Use Grep to find existing test pipelines or similar block-related testing configurations: pattern "block.*test" or "discovery"
4) Read example pipeline files to understand the JSON schema including: stage definitions, dependencies, parameters, timeout settings, and error handling
5) Examine how stages are connected via dependencies and how output from one stage flows to the next
6) Identify what parameters each manager type expects (e.g., difficulty settings, mining duration, block validation criteria)
7) Document the structure needed for each of the 9 stages with their specific manager and parameters
8) Plan the JSON structure with proper stage ordering, dependency chains (setup_infrastructure → set_minimal_difficulty → start_mining → monitor_for_block → verify_pool_submission → verify_daemon_acceptance → generate_maturity_blocks → verify_wallet_credit → block_discovery_verified)
9) Write the complete pipeline JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- The pipeline must handle the sequential flow where each stage depends on the previous completion
- Must account for timing issues (mining takes time, block maturity requires multiple blocks)
- Need to handle potential failures at each stage (network issues, mining failures, validation failures)
- Should include timeout configurations for long-running stages like mining and maturity generation
- Must verify data flows correctly between stages (block hash from discovery to validation)
- Edge cases: no blocks found, daemon rejection, wallet credit delays

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the existing pipeline JSON structure found in the codebase
- Will document the parameters and capabilities of each manager component
- Will provide the complete JSON file with all 9 stages properly configured
- Will show that dependencies are correctly chained from setup through final verification
- Will demonstrate that each stage has appropriate configuration for its manager type

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to first examine the codebase to understand the existing pipeline structure and manager interfaces. The task is well-defined with clear stages, but without seeing the existing implementation patterns, I cannot be certain of the exact JSON schema and parameter names required. Once I examine existing pipeline files and manager references, confidence will increase to High.
