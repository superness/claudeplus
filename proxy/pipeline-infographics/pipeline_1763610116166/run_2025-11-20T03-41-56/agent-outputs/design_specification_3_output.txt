UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a test pipeline JSON configuration for testing block discovery functionality. The pipeline has 9 stages that test the complete flow from infrastructure setup through block discovery, submission, daemon acceptance, maturation, and final wallet credit verification. Each stage is associated with a specific manager component (config_generator, miner_manager, block_validator, bitcoin_daemon_manager, wallet_manager).

APPROACH: I will examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the schema and structure, then create a new pipeline JSON that follows the same pattern but implements the 9-stage block discovery test flow with proper stage definitions, dependencies, manager assignments, and validation criteria.

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the schema
2) Use Read to examine 1-2 example pipeline files to identify required fields (stages, dependencies, manager assignments, timeout settings, validation rules)
3) Use Grep to search for references to managers like "config_generator", "miner_manager", "block_validator" to understand their expected parameters
4) Design the pipeline structure with:
   - Stage definitions for all 9 stages
   - Proper sequential dependencies (stage 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9)
   - Manager component assignments
   - Appropriate timeout values for each stage
   - Validation criteria for block discovery, submission, acceptance, maturation, and wallet credit
5) Use Write to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/block-discovery-test.json with the complete pipeline configuration

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: The plan will address:
- Proper sequential execution (each stage depends on previous completion)
- Infrastructure setup before mining operations
- Minimal difficulty setting to ensure block discovery in test environment
- Block monitoring with appropriate timeout periods
- Validation at each critical point (pool submission, daemon acceptance, wallet credit)
- Maturity block generation (typically 100 blocks for coinbase maturity)
- Error handling for failed stages
- Timeout configurations appropriate for each operation type

EVIDENCE: Will provide:
- Schema analysis from existing pipeline files showing required fields
- The complete JSON structure with all 9 stages properly configured
- Stage dependency chain showing proper execution order
- Manager assignments matching the specified components
- Validation criteria for each verification stage

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I can see the pipeline structure and stages clearly defined, but I need to examine existing pipeline files to ensure the JSON schema matches the system's expectations and includes all required fields for proper execution. The stage flow and manager assignments are well-specified, but timeout values and validation parameters need to be informed by existing examples.
