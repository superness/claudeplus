ASSESSMENT: The plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the task and follows a logical approach. However, there are several critical weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding that a JSON pipeline configuration is needed
- Correctly identifies the need to examine existing files first to understand schema
- Lists all 9 stages with their executors as specified
- Recognizes the linear dependency chain requirement
- Includes thoughtful test considerations (timeouts, difficulty, maturity blocks, error handling)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence Quality Issues**: The proposed evidence is process-oriented rather than outcome-oriented:
   - "Validation that JSON is syntactically correct" - doesn't prove the pipeline works
   - "Confirmation that all 9 stages are present" - checks quantity but not quality
   - "Verification that dependency chain is properly defined" - vague, no concrete verification method
   - Missing: How will you verify the parameters are correct for each executor?
   - Missing: How will you confirm the JSON schema matches existing pipelines exactly?

2. **Confidence Level Contradiction**: Rated "Medium" confidence but the evidence collection steps are weak. If confidence is medium, the plan should include MORE rigorous validation steps, not fewer.

3. **No Concrete Validation Method**: The plan says "validate JSON syntax is correct" but doesn't specify:
   - Will you use a JSON validator tool?
   - Will you compare against a schema file?
   - Will you test-load it with the actual pipeline executor?

4. **Missing Schema Discovery Details**: While Step 1 mentions reading existing files, it doesn't specify:
   - Which specific files will be examined?
   - What schema elements must be identified?
   - How will you extract the schema requirements?

5. **Incomplete Parameter Specification**: The plan mentions "appropriate parameters" but doesn't explain how you'll determine what's appropriate for each executor without examining executor source code or documentation.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence focuses on structural completeness (file exists, has 9 stages, has dependencies) but lacks substantive validation that the pipeline would actually work. Strong evidence would include:
- Successful schema validation against existing pipeline schema
- Parameter validation against executor requirements
- Ideally: dry-run or syntax check by the actual pipeline execution system
- Comparison diff showing structural consistency with similar existing pipelines

DECISION: REJECTED

The plan needs revision to include:
1. Specific validation steps with concrete tools/methods
2. Schema extraction and validation procedures
3. Parameter validation against executor specifications
4. A clear method to prove the JSON will work when executed

DECISION: REJECTED
