ASSESSMENT:

**Understanding of Requirements:** The plan demonstrates good understanding of the user's request - to create a pipeline JSON file with 9 sequential stages testing block discovery. The stage names and service assignments are clearly identified.

**Approach Quality:** The approach is methodologically sound:
- Steps 1-2 show proper research methodology (finding existing examples before creating new content)
- Step 3 validates service references exist in the codebase
- Steps 4-6 show detailed JSON structure planning
- Step 7 delivers to the exact specified path

**Critical Weakness - Evidence Collection:** 
The plan LACKS a concrete verification step after file creation. Step 7 says "Write the complete JSON" but there's no Step 8 that says:
- "Read back the created file to verify it was written correctly"
- "Validate the JSON syntax is correct"
- "Confirm all 9 stages are present with proper dependencies"
- "Show the user the complete file contents for review"

The "EVIDENCE" section mentions "Will provide the final file path confirmation" but this is NOT sufficient proof. A path confirmation only proves a write was attempted, not that:
- The file contains valid JSON
- All 9 stages are correctly defined
- The dependency chain is properly configured
- The service assignments match the requirements

**Confidence Assessment:** The plan honestly rates itself as "Medium" confidence and acknowledges it may need to "infer the exact schema format" without existing examples. This is appropriate caution, but makes the lack of verification steps even more critical.

**Test Considerations:** Good coverage of technical requirements (timeouts, dependencies, async operations) but these are planning considerations, not verification evidence.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is insufficient:
- "examine existing pipeline JSON schema" - research activity, not completion proof
- "verify service names match actual service implementations" - validation during creation, not after
- "show the complete JSON structure" - plan describes this but doesn't commit to displaying it to user
- "validate the dependency chain flows correctly" - no specific verification method described
- "provide the final file path confirmation" - weakest evidence, only proves write attempt

**Missing Evidence Requirements:**
1. Read-back verification of the created file
2. JSON syntax validation
3. Explicit display of complete file contents to user
4. Verification checklist (9 stages present, correct service assignments, proper dependency chain)

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:** While the plan shows good understanding and a logical approach, it fails to include concrete verification steps that would prove task completion. The plan must be revised to include explicit steps that:
1. Read back the created file after writing
2. Validate JSON syntax
3. Display the complete contents to the user
4. Verify all 9 stages are present with correct service assignments
5. Confirm the dependency chain matches the specification

Without these verification steps, we cannot provide "CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE evidence" that the task was completed successfully.

DECISION: REJECTED
