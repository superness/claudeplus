## Recovery Complete - Summary

### Recovery Executed: Pool Disconnection Recovery (Strategy 3)

**Problem Diagnosed:**
Pool process was in corrupted state - running but Stratum port not binding properly despite log messages claiming "listening". This is a common failure mode where the process survives but critical functionality fails silently.

**Recovery Actions Taken:**

1. **Stopped Corrupted Pool Process**
   - Attempted graceful termination (failed)
   - Force terminated PID 44988
   - Verified process fully terminated
   - Confirmed port 3333 released

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Verified pool RPC credentials match daemon config
   - Pool: 172.22.45.9:18443, coiniumtest/testpass123
   - Daemon: Accepts 172.22.45.0/24 with matching credentials
   - Tested RPC authentication via curl - SUCCESSFUL

3. **Pool Restart**
   - Started fresh CoiniumServ.exe process (PID 41228)
   - Waited 12 seconds for initialization
   - Process started cleanly without errors

4. **Stratum Port Verification**
   - **Windows netstat**: Port 3333 LISTENING on 0.0.0.0 (PID 41228) ✓
   - **Active connection**: ESTABLISHED from 10.0.0.202:51914 ✓
   - **WSL connectivity**: Accessible via Windows host IP 172.22.32.1:3333 ✓
   - Note: WSL localhost cannot reach Windows process directly (expected networking behavior)

5. **Daemon Connection Verification**
   - **NetworkInfo logs**: Successfully queried daemon (342 blocks, wallet version 169900) ✓
   - **JobManager logs**: Broadcasting mining jobs every 55 seconds ✓
   - **Stratum connections**: Accepting clients from 10.0.0.202 and 172.22.45.9 ✓
   - **No RPC errors**: Zero connection or authentication failures in recent logs ✓
   - **Daemon RPC**: Still accessible via bitcoin-cli (342 blocks) ✓

### Recovery Results

**✓ Pool Process**: Running (PID 41228, 92 MB memory)
**✓ Stratum Server**: LISTENING on 0.0.0.0:3333 with active connections
**✓ Daemon Connection**: OPERATIONAL - pool querying daemon, broadcasting jobs
**✓ RPC Authentication**: WORKING - no auth errors, credentials validated
**✓ Mining Jobs**: ACTIVE - JobManager broadcasting new jobs every ~55 seconds

### Infrastructure Status Post-Recovery

**Daemon (bitcoind)**: 
- Status: RUNNING and STABLE
- RPC: Accessible on port 18443
- Blockchain: 342 blocks (regtest)
- Wallet: Funded (300 BTC confirmed)

**Pool (CoiniumServ)**:
- Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL (recovered from corrupted state)
- Stratum: Listening on 0.0.0.0:3333
- Daemon RPC: Connected and authenticated
- Job Broadcasting: Active
- Client Connections: Accepting

**Recovery Time**: ~2 minutes from detection to full restoration

### Next Steps

The infrastructure is now ready for miner connection and share submission testing. Pool has been successfully recovered from corrupted state and all functionality verified operational.
