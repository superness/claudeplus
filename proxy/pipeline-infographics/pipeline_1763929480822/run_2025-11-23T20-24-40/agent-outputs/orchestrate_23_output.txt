## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✅ **Dependencies:**
- bitcoind: Installed at `/home/super/bin/bitcoind`
- Mono runtime: Installed at `/usr/bin/mono`

✅ **Daemon Process:**
- Running (PID 35780)
- BUT: RPC authentication is FAILING

✅ **Pool Process:**
- Running (PID 43584 - CoiniumServ.exe)
- BUT: Stratum port 3333 NOT accessible (Connection refused)

❌ **Critical Configuration Mismatch Detected:**
- **Daemon config** (`~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`): RPC credentials are `coiniumtest/testpass123`
- **Pool config** (`pools/default.json`): Using SAME credentials `coiniumtest/testpass123` ✓
- **BUT**: Daemon logs show "incorrect password attempt" - RPC authentication is failing
- **Stratum port 3333**: Pool configured to bind but connection refused

❌ **Integration Issues:**
1. RPC authentication failures preventing daemon-pool communication
2. Stratum port not accessible despite pool process running
3. Pool cannot get block templates from daemon due to RPC failures

**Root Cause Identified:**
The daemon and pool configurations APPEAR to match, but RPC authentication is consistently failing. This suggests either:
1. Daemon needs restart to load current config
2. Credentials mismatch in runtime vs config file
3. RPC endpoint configuration issue

**Dependencies Satisfied:** ✓ (bitcoind, mono installed)
**Configs Present:** ✓ (but credentials not working)
**Daemon Process:** Running but RPC broken
**Pool Process:** Running but cannot connect to daemon or bind Stratum properly

**Next Required Action:**
The daemon RPC authentication is broken, preventing all downstream operations. This is a critical RPC connectivity issue that requires specialized diagnosis and repair.

DECISION: handle_rpc_errors

REASONING:
Critical RPC authentication failure detected between daemon and pool:
- Daemon running but rejecting all RPC authentication attempts with "incorrect password"
- Configuration files show matching credentials (coiniumtest/testpass123)
- Pool cannot connect to daemon due to RPC auth failures
- Stratum port not accessible, likely because pool initialization failed due to RPC failure
- Recent daemon logs show continuous "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt" errors

This is a specialized RPC connectivity problem requiring dedicated RPC error handling to:
1. Diagnose why configured credentials are being rejected
2. Verify daemon is reading correct bitcoin.conf
3. Potentially restart daemon to reload configuration
4. Re-establish RPC connectivity before pool can function

Cannot proceed with validation or other setup until RPC authentication is fixed. Routing to specialized RPC error handler.
