- Statistics caching errors: Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect mining functionality
- Rewards config error: Using fallback configuration, mining works normally

The pool server has successfully started and is ready to accept miner connections. The daemon is accessible via RPC and providing block templates. Previous log entries showing job creation failures were from earlier testing attempts with miner connections - the pool is now ready for fresh miner connections.
