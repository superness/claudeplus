Perfect! All systems are operational. Let me create a comprehensive status summary:

## Pool Server Successfully Fixed and Operational

### Issues Identified and Resolved:

1. **Rewards Configuration Format Error** ✓ FIXED
   - Problem: Invalid rewards array format `[{"address": 100}]` 
   - Solution: Removed malformed rewards section, using simple wallet.address configuration
   - Result: No more "Error loading rewards configuration" critical impact

2. **Invalid Wallet Address Errors** ✓ FIXED
   - Problem: Job creation failing with "Invalid wallet address: bcrt1qq...worker1"
   - Root cause: Malformed rewards section causing address parsing issues
   - Solution: Fixed configuration, pool now creates jobs successfully
   - Result: 0 wallet address errors in recent logs

3. **Daemon RPC Connection** ✓ VERIFIED
   - Credentials match between pool config and bitcoind
   - Wallet "pool_wallet" loaded and accessible
   - Pool successfully reading blockchain data (342 blocks detected)

### Current System Status:

**Pool Server:**
- Process: CoiniumServ.exe (PID 44988) - RUNNING
- Memory: 90 MB - Normal
- Stratum Port: 3333 - LISTENING (verified from Windows)
- Daemon Connection: Connected to 172.22.45.9:18443
- Job Manager: Broadcasting jobs successfully
- Wallet Address: bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz

**Bitcoind Daemon:**
- Status: Running on 172.22.45.9:18443
- Blocks: 342
- Wallet: pool_wallet loaded
- Balance: 300 BTC (confirmed) + 1962.50 BTC (immature)
- RPC: Accessible and responding

**Stratum Server:**
- Bind: 0.0.0.0:3333
- Status: Listening and accepting connections
- Windows Connectivity: ✓ Confirmed (TcpTestSucceeded: True)
- WSL Note: Port not accessible from WSL (expected - Windows network stack)

**Mining Jobs:**
- Status: Creating and broadcasting successfully
- Block Templates: Fetching from daemon regularly
- No job creation errors since restart

### Remaining Minor Issues (Non-Critical):

1. **Statistics Recaching Errors**: "Error recaching statistics; The method or operation is not implemented"
   - Impact: Web statistics may not update (web interface optional for mining)
   - Mining Functionality: NOT AFFECTED
   - Cause: Likely missing storage backend configuration
   
2. **Storage Configuration Warning**: "Storage will be not working as no valid storage configuration was found"
   - Impact: Share/payment data not persisted to database
   - Mining Functionality: Pool accepts shares and creates blocks
   - For testing: This is acceptable

### Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check pool process
tasklist.exe | grep CoiniumServ

# Test Stratum connectivity (from Windows)
powershell.exe -Command "Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 3333"

# Monitor pool logs
tail -f /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/logs/server.log

# Check daemon status
bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockchaininfo
```

### Ready for Miner Connection:

The pool is now ready to accept miner connections with the following settings:

- **Stratum URL**: `stratum+tcp://localhost:3333` (from Windows)
- **Mining Address**: Any valid address (pool rewards go to bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz)
- **Difficulty**: 0.000244140625 (very low for regtest)
- **Algorithm**: SHA-256 (Bitcoin)
