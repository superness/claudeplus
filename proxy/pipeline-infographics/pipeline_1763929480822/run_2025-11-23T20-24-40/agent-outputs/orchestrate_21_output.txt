## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current Infrastructure State:**

**✅ OPERATIONAL:**
- **Dependencies**: bitcoind, Mono runtime, cpuminer all installed
- **Daemon**: Running (PID 35780, 55986), RPC accessible on port 18443
  - Chain: regtest, 342 blocks
  - Wallet balance: 300 BTC (well funded)
  - RPC credentials: coiniumtest/testpass123 ✓
- **Pool**: CoiniumServ.exe running (PID 36508)
  - Configuration exists with correct daemon connection (172.22.45.9:18443)
  - Wallet address: bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz
- **Miner**: cpuminer installed and running (PID 50733)
  - Current target: 10.0.0.202:3333 (WRONG ADDRESS)
  - Wallet: bcrt1qx7m2kdcp5x2pw2wrudhy2nr7jr3zhptsx0fgjf

**❌ ISSUES DETECTED:**

1. **CRITICAL: Pool Stratum Port Not Accessible**
   - Pool process running but Stratum port 3333 not accepting connections
   - Pool logs show: "Error recaching statistics; The method or operation is not implemented"
   - Port 3333 connection refused (tested with nc)

2. **Miner Misconfigured**
   - Miner pointing to wrong IP: 10.0.0.202 (should be 127.0.0.1 or 172.22.45.9)
   - Miner cannot connect to pool due to wrong address + port not listening

3. **Pool Functionality Compromised**
   - Pool statistics errors indicate internal component failure
   - Despite daemon running healthy, pool not properly initialized

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The pool server started but failed to properly initialize its Stratum listener and internal statistics components. This is preventing the entire mining pipeline from functioning.

**Next Action Required:**
Delegate to error recovery agent to diagnose and fix the pool's Stratum initialization failure and statistics errors. The recovery agent will:
1. Analyze pool logs for specific failure points
2. Check if Stratum module failed to bind
3. Verify daemon connectivity from pool perspective
4. Restart pool with proper initialization
5. Verify Stratum port becomes accessible
