## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Summary:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✓ INSTALLED
   - bitcoind: Installed at /home/super/bin/bitcoind
   - Mono runtime: Version 6.8.0.105 (for CoiniumServ)
   - CoiniumServ.exe: Binary exists

2. **Configurations**: ✓ EXISTS
   - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf exists
   - Pool config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json exists
   - Pool-specific config: default.json exists with valid settings

3. **Bitcoin Daemon**: ✓ RUNNING (with issues)
   - Process running (PIDs: 35780, 44541)
   - RPC accessible on port 18443
   - Chain: regtest, Block height: 342
   - Wallet funded: 300 BTC confirmed, 1962.5 BTC immature
   - **BUT**: RPC port not showing in netstat (possible connectivity issue)

4. **Pool Server**: ✓ RUNNING (with CRITICAL errors)
   - CoiniumServ.exe process running (PID 20188)
   - **CRITICAL ERROR**: "Invalid wallet address: bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1"
   - Job creation failing repeatedly
   - Statistics recaching errors
   - **Stratum port 3333**: NOT accessible (connection refused)

5. **Miner**: ✗ NOT CONFIGURED
   - No miner configuration detected

## Root Cause Analysis

The pool is running but **CRITICALLY FAILING** due to:

1. **Invalid wallet address format**: Pool is appending ".worker1" to the wallet address "bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7", resulting in an invalid address format
2. **Job creation failure**: Cannot create mining jobs due to wallet address validation failure
3. **Stratum port not accessible**: Despite pool running, Stratum port 3333 is refusing connections (likely because job manager is failing)

The pool configuration shows:
- Wallet address: `bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz`
- But error mentions: `bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1`

This indicates a **configuration mismatch** or the pool is attempting to parse worker names incorrectly.

## Decision Reasoning

**Infrastructure exists but is functionally broken**. This is NOT a fresh setup scenario - components are running but the pool has critical functional errors preventing mining operations:

- Daemon: Operational ✓
- Pool: Running but job creation failing ✗ (CRITICAL)
- Miner: Not configured ✗
- Validation: Cannot pass with pool errors ✗

**Root issue**: Pool configuration or code logic error causing invalid wallet address validation. This is a **pool-specific functional error** that requires targeted pool error handling.

The error pattern shows:
- Pool process is alive
- RPC connection to daemon works (or it couldn't attempt jobs)
- Wallet address validation logic is breaking
- This is a **pool function validation failure**, not a generic infrastructure issue

**Appropriate routing**: This requires **pool function validation and fixing** - we need to diagnose why the pool's wallet address handling is breaking and fix the specific pool functionality.
