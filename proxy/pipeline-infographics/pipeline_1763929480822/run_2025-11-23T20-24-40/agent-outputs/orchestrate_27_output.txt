Excellent! Now I have a complete understanding of the infrastructure state:

## Infrastructure State Analysis

**✓ WORKING:**
1. **Dependencies**: bitcoind installed
2. **Configs**: Both daemon and pool configs exist
3. **Daemon**: Running, RPC accessible on 18443, wallet funded (300 BTC balance, 1962.50 immature)
4. **Blockchain**: 342 blocks generated

**✗ ISSUES DETECTED:**
1. **RPC Authentication**: Daemon logs show "incorrect password attempt" errors
2. **Stratum Port**: Pool says "listening on 0.0.0.0:3333" but port test shows "Connection refused"
3. **Pool Errors**: Multiple critical issues:
   - No wallet loaded in daemon (getwalletinfo error at startup)
   - Invalid wallet address errors when creating mining jobs
   - Statistics recaching failures (NotImplemented exception)
   - SocketExceptions on Stratum connections
4. **Miner**: Not configured yet

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
The pool process is running but has multiple functional failures:
- Stratum server claims to be listening but connections fail (likely crashed or not actually bound)
- RPC credentials mismatch causing authentication failures
- Wallet not loaded in daemon causing job creation failures
- Configuration errors in rewards section

## Decision

This is a complex integration failure requiring specialized error handling. The pool has multiple interconnected issues:
1. RPC authentication problems (daemon errors show wrong password attempts)
2. Stratum server functionality issues (port not actually accessible despite log saying "listening")
3. Wallet loading failures
4. Configuration errors in pool config

This requires targeted pool error handling to diagnose and fix these specific issues systematically.

**DECISION: handle_pool_errors**

**REASONING:**
Current infrastructure state shows:
- Daemon: Running and healthy (block 342, wallet funded, RPC accessible)
- Pool process: Running BUT functionally broken with multiple critical errors:
  * RPC authentication failures (incorrect password attempts)
  * Stratum port 3333 not accessible despite "listening" log message
  * Job creation failures (invalid wallet address errors)
  * No wallet loaded error at startup
  * Statistics recaching failures

Pool-specific error handler is needed to:
1. Fix RPC credential mismatch between daemon config and pool config
2. Diagnose why Stratum port claims to listen but isn't accessible
3. Ensure wallet is loaded in daemon before pool connects
4. Fix configuration issues in pool config (rewards, storage)
5. Restart pool with corrected configuration

This is clearly a pool-specific error scenario requiring the specialized pool error handler rather than generic recovery.

DECISION: handle_pool_errors
