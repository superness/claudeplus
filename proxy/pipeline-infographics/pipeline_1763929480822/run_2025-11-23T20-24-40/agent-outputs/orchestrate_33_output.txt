## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

Based on my comprehensive diagnostic checks, I have identified the following infrastructure state:

**✓ COMPONENTS OPERATIONAL:**

1. **Bitcoin Daemon (bitcoind)**
   - Status: Running (2 processes: PIDs 35780, 68802)
   - RPC: Accessible on port 18443 (listening on 0.0.0.0)
   - Credentials: coiniumtest / testpass123
   - Chain: regtest
   - Block height: 342 blocks
   - Wallet balance: 300.00 BTC (fully funded)
   - getblocktemplate: Working correctly

2. **Pool Server (CoiniumServ)**
   - Status: Running (PID 41228)
   - Stratum port: 3333 (listening on 0.0.0.0)
   - Daemon connection: Configured to 172.22.45.9:18443
   - RPC credentials: Matching daemon (coiniumtest/testpass123)
   - Pool wallet: bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz
   - Job broadcasting: Active (broadcasting to 1 subscriber)

3. **Miner (cpuminer)**
   - Status: Running (PIDs 57680, 69299)
   - Connection: stratum+tcp://10.0.0.202:3333
   - Mining address: bcrt1qx7m2kdcp5x2pw2wrudhy2nr7jr3zhptsx0fgjf
   - Threads: 4
   - Algorithm: sha256d

4. **Configuration Files**
   - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf ✓
   - Pool config: /mnt/c/github/.../config.json ✓
   - Pool-specific config: /mnt/c/github/.../pools/default.json ✓

**OBSERVATIONS:**

1. All core components are running and operational
2. Daemon has generated 342 blocks with recent mining activity (last 10 transactions visible)
3. Pool is connected to daemon and broadcasting jobs
4. Miner is running but connecting to IP address (10.0.0.202) instead of localhost
5. Wallet has 300 BTC balance with recent immature coinbase rewards
6. Network hash rate detected: 0.00056 H/s
7. Minor issue: Pool logs show recurring "Error recaching statistics" but this appears non-critical

**DECISION RATIONALE:**

All infrastructure components are already set up, running, and operational:
- Dependencies: Installed ✓ (bitcoind, Mono, cpuminer)
- Configs: Generated and valid ✓
- Daemon: Running with funded wallet ✓
- Pool: Running and connected to daemon ✓
- Miner: Running and configured ✓

The infrastructure appears to be complete and functional. However, I need to perform comprehensive validation to ensure end-to-end integration is working correctly, verify all component communications, and confirm the mining cycle is operational.

DECISION: delegate_validation
