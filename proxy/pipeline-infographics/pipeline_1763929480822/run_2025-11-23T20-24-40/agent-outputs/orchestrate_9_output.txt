## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✅ **Dependencies**: 
- bitcoind installed at /home/super/bin/bitcoind
- Mono runtime installed at /usr/bin/mono
- CoiniumServ.exe binary exists

✅ **Daemon Status**:
- Process running (PID 35780)
- RPC accessible and responding
- Blockchain height: 342 blocks
- Wallet funded: 300 BTC confirmed + 1962.50 BTC immature
- Running in regtest mode correctly

✅ **Configuration Files**:
- Daemon config exists: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
- Pool config exists: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json
- Pool configuration for Bitcoin exists: pools/default.json
- Daemon connection configured: RPC host 172.22.45.9:18443 with credentials

❌ **Pool Status**:
- CoiniumServ process NOT running
- Stratum port 3333 not in use (available)
- Pool needs to be started

❌ **Miner Status**:
- Not configured yet
- Wallet address available in pool config: bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz

**Infrastructure Gaps Identified:**

1. **Daemon**: Fully operational ✓
2. **Pool**: Configured but not running (needs startup)
3. **Miner**: Not yet configured
4. **Validation**: Required after pool and miner setup

**Dependency Analysis:**

The infrastructure has a clear dependency chain:
- Dependencies → ✅ COMPLETE
- Configs → ✅ COMPLETE  
- Daemon → ✅ RUNNING (342 blocks, wallet funded)
- Pool → ❌ NEEDS STARTUP (depends on daemon - dependency satisfied)
- Miner → ⏸️ PENDING (depends on pool)
- Validation → ⏸️ PENDING (depends on all components)

**Optimal Next Action:**

Since the daemon is already running and healthy with RPC accessible, and all configuration files exist, the next logical step is to start the pool server. The pool server depends ONLY on the daemon, which is operational. Starting the pool will enable the Stratum interface for miners to connect.

Skipping dependency check and config generation as they are already complete. Moving directly to pool setup.
