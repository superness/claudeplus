## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

### ✓ Components Already Complete:
1. **Dependencies**: All required software installed
   - bitcoind: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind`
   - bitcoin-cli: `/home/super/bin/bitcoin-cli`
   - Mono runtime: `/usr/bin/mono`
   - cpuminer: `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer`
   - CoiniumServ.exe: Present at `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/`

2. **Configuration Files**: All configs exist and properly configured
   - Daemon config: `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (RPC user: coiniumtest, port: 18443)
   - Pool config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json`
   - Pool instance config: `config/pools/default.json` (Stratum port: 3333, daemon connection configured)

3. **Daemon Status**: RUNNING and OPERATIONAL
   - Process ID: 35780
   - Chain: regtest
   - Block height: 342
   - RPC accessible on port 18443
   - Wallet balance: 300.00 BTC (well funded)
   - Status: Healthy and responsive

### ✗ Components Not Running:
1. **Pool Server**: CoiniumServ not running
   - Process: Not detected
   - Stratum port 3333: Not listening
   - Status: Needs to be started

2. **Miner**: Not configured or running
   - Status: Needs configuration after pool is operational

### Critical Observations:
- Port 18443 (daemon RPC): Currently not showing in netstat, but RPC is responding (daemon is accessible)
- Port 3333 (Stratum): Not in use, available for pool
- Pool configuration has correct daemon connection details (host: 172.22.45.9, port: 18443, credentials match)
- Wallet address configured in pool: `bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz`

## Orchestration Decision

**Infrastructure Status**:
- Dependencies: ✓ Installed
- Configurations: ✓ Generated and valid
- Daemon: ✓ Running, funded, operational
- Pool: ✗ Not running (next component to set up)
- Miner: ✗ Not configured (depends on pool)

**Dependency Chain Analysis**:
```
Dependencies ✓ → Configs ✓ → Daemon ✓ → Pool ✗ → Miner ✗ → Validation ✗
```

**Gap Identified**: Pool server is not running. This is the critical missing component preventing infrastructure completion.

**Next Action**: Since the daemon is confirmed running and healthy with correct RPC configuration matching the pool's expected connection parameters, the logical next step is to start the CoiniumServ pool server which depends on the daemon.

However, before starting the pool, I should validate that all daemon functions are working correctly to ensure the pool will be able to connect successfully. This includes:
- RPC connectivity from pool's perspective
- getblocktemplate availability
- Wallet functionality

This validation step is crucial because starting the pool without confirming daemon readiness could lead to immediate pool failures.

DECISION: validate_daemon_function

REASONING:
Current infrastructure state: Dependencies installed ✓, Configs generated ✓, Daemon running ✓ (PID 35780, block 342, 300 BTC funded). Pool and miner not running.

Before starting the pool server (next component in dependency chain), I need to validate that the daemon is fully functional from the pool's perspective:
1. RPC accessible from pool's network address (172.22.45.9:18443)
2. getblocktemplate RPC call working (critical for pool operation)
3. Wallet commands functional (submitblock, getblock)

This validation ensures the pool will successfully connect when started, preventing immediate failure. Daemon appears healthy, but functional validation from pool's connection perspective is required before proceeding to pool setup.
