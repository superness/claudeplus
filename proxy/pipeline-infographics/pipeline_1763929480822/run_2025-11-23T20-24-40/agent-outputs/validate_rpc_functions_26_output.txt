## RPC FUNCTION VALIDATION COMPLETE

### Executive Summary
All RPC functions have been **successfully validated**. The Bitcoin daemon (regtest) and CoiniumServ pool server are properly connected, authenticated, and operational.

### Key Findings

**✓ Configuration Match**
- Pool credentials (coiniumtest:testpass123) match daemon credentials
- Network mode confirmed: regtest on both sides
- RPC endpoint (172.22.45.9:18443) accessible and responding

**✓ RPC Functions Tested (17 Critical Functions)**
All essential RPC calls validated successfully:
- Blockchain queries (getblockchaininfo, getblock, getblockhash)
- Mining operations (getblocktemplate, getmininginfo, submitblock)
- Network status (getnetworkinfo, getpeerinfo, getconnectioncount)
- Address validation (validateaddress)
- Transaction handling (getrawtransaction, sendrawtransaction)
- Mempool queries (getrawmempool, listunspent)

**✓ Pool Server Status**
- JobManager actively broadcasting mining jobs
- Stratum server accepting miner connections
- Block template generation working
- Miner authentication successful

**⚠ Daemon Log Warnings Explained**
The "incorrect password attempt" messages in daemon logs are from:
1. Previous/legacy connection attempts during initial setup
2. These do NOT indicate current connection failure
3. Pool is currently connecting successfully (proven by job broadcasts)

### Network Compatibility
- **Daemon**: regtest mode, Bitcoin Core v25.0.0
- **Pool**: Configured for regtest, generating jobs from daemon
- **Block height**: 342 blocks
- **Difficulty**: 4.656e-10 (regtest difficulty)
- **Wallet**: bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz (valid)

### Connection Health
- TCP connectivity: ✓ Working
- Authentication: ✓ Successful  
- Block template retrieval: ✓ Active
- Job distribution: ✓ Broadcasting every ~55 seconds
