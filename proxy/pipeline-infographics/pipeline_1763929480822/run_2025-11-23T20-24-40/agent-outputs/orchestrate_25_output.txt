DECISION: validate_rpc_function

REASONING:
Current infrastructure analysis reveals:
- Daemon: Running and operational (block height 342, wallet funded with 300 BTC)
- Pool: Running but NON-FUNCTIONAL (Stratum port not accessible, RPC authentication failing)
- Daemon logs show repeated "incorrect password attempts" from pool
- Pool config has credentials: coiniumtest:testpass123
- Daemon config has same credentials: coiniumtest:testpass123

Before attempting pool recovery or config regeneration, must validate RPC function to determine:
1. Are the daemon RPC credentials actually correct and functional?
2. Can the pool's configured RPC endpoint (172.22.45.9:18443) reach the daemon?
3. Is this a daemon-side RPC configuration issue or a pool-side connection issue?

RPC validation will isolate the root cause (daemon config vs pool config vs network connectivity) and inform the correct recovery strategy. If RPC validation passes, the issue is pool-side (needs pool recovery). If RPC validation fails, the issue is daemon-side (needs daemon config fix or daemon restart).

Dependencies satisfied: Daemon running, pool running, configs exist. RPC validation is a diagnostic step that doesn't depend on other components being operational.
