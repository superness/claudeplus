**CRITICAL REALIZATION**: This is a **fundamental architectural mismatch** between CoiniumServ and the miner configuration:

1. **CoiniumServ Design**: Solo mining pool where miners provide their own wallet address as username
2. **Current Miner**: Sending `wallet.worker1` format (standard pool mining practice)
3. **The Conflict**: CoiniumServ tries to use `bcrt1q...7.worker1` as a wallet address and fails validation

**This is NOT fixable from the pool configuration alone.** The issue requires EITHER:
- A: Miner reconfiguration to send bare wallet address (no worker suffix)
- B: CoiniumServ code modification to strip worker suffixes  
- C: Use a different pool software that supports true pool mining

Since I'm the Pool Manager and this is a critical pool operation error that cannot be resolved through configuration alone, I need to report this as a **pool_error** with detailed diagnosis.

## Pool Error Summary

**Error Type**: Pool-Miner Protocol Incompatibility  
**Status**: Cannot be resolved through pool configuration  
**Root Cause**: CoiniumServ is designed for solo mining mode and cannot handle worker name suffixes in miner usernames

**Evidence**:
- Pool process running (PID 4148, now stopped)
- Stratum server listening on 0.0.0.0:3333
- Miner connects successfully and authenticates
- Job creation fails: "Invalid wallet address: bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1"
- Error occurs in `GenerationTransaction` constructor when building coinbase
- Pool code attempts to use miner's username as wallet address
- Worker suffix `.worker1` makes address invalid for Bitcoin validation

**Configuration Attempts Made**:
1. ✓ Updated pool wallet to valid bech32 address from daemon
2. ✓ Added `rewards` section (correct format: `{"address": percent}`)
3. ✓ Set `validateUsername: false` to disable validation
4. ✗ **Failed**: Pool still uses miner username as wallet address regardless of settings

**Technical Analysis**:
- CoiniumServ architecture: Solo mining pool (each miner provides their own address)
- `wallet.address` in config: Not used for miner rewards, only for pool reference
- `rewards` array: Pool fee deductions, not primary mining address
- Miner authentication: Username expected to be a valid wallet address
- Current miner: Sending `address.workername` (standard Stratum convention)
- Incompatibility: CoiniumServ expects bare addresses, cannot parse worker suffixes

**Required Resolution** (Outside Pool Manager Scope):
The **miner** must be reconfigured to connect using ONE of these patterns:
- Username: bare wallet address (no `.worker1` suffix)
- Username: arbitrary string (not a wallet address) if pool supports anonymous mining
- Different pool software that supports standard pool mining with worker names

**Current State**:
- Daemon: RUNNING and accessible (172.22.45.9:18443)
- Pool: STOPPED (incompatibility detected)
- Stratum port: NOT listening (pool stopped)
- Miner: Will fail to mine until reconfigured

DECISION: pool_error
