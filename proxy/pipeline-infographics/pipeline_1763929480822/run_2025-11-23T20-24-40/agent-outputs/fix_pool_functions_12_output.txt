I've reverted to original code. The actual solution is: **CoiniumServ cannot be fixed without recompiling**, and the build environment isn't set up properly.

##pool_functions_fixed Pool Configuration Analysis & Outcome

**Root Cause Identified**:
The CoiniumServ pool software has a design flaw in `GenerationTransaction.cs:183` where it attempts to pay block rewards to `miner.Username`, treating it as a wallet address. When miners connect with `address.workername` format (e.g., `bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1`), this fails wallet validation.

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ✓ Removed `useWorkerAsUsername` config option
2. ✓ Fixed rewards configuration format  
3. ✗ **Cannot recompile** - Build environment lacks proper MSBuild/Visual Studio setup
4. ✗ Source code modification unsuccessful without rebuild capability

**Current State**:
- Pool configuration: Correct (rewards set to 100% pool address)
- Source code: Identified the bug but cannot compile fix
- Build toolchain: xbuild deprecated, MSBuild not available in WSL

**Alternative Solutions Required**:
Since recompilation failed, the pool functionality cannot be fixed through code changes. The issue requires either:
- Setting up Windows Visual Studio build environment
- Using precompiled binaries from a working CoiniumServ build
- Modifying miner behavior to use simple usernames instead of wallet addresses
