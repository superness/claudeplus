## RPC Function Validation Complete

I have thoroughly validated the RPC connection between the Bitcoin daemon and CoiniumServ pool server. Here are the results:

### ✓ Daemon RPC Status
- **Network**: regtest mode (confirmed)
- **RPC Port**: 18443 listening on 0.0.0.0
- **Authentication**: Working with coiniumtest:testpass123
- **Block Height**: 342 blocks
- **Wallet Balance**: 300 BTC confirmed

### ✓ All Critical RPC Methods Validated (10/10)
1. **getblockchaininfo** - Blockchain status ✓
2. **getnetworkinfo** - Network information ✓
3. **getmininginfo** - Mining difficulty/hashrate ✓
4. **getblocktemplate** - Block template generation ✓
5. **submitblock** - Block submission ✓
6. **getbalance** - Wallet balance ✓
7. **validateaddress** - Address validation ✓
8. **getmempoolinfo** - Transaction mempool ✓
9. **getpeerinfo** - Network peers ✓
10. **getdifficulty** - Current difficulty ✓

### ✓ Pool Connectivity Verified
- Pool wallet address: `bcrt1qqxg68cf2gkhzqdq23k5lpgap7nejfdsg5cqegz` (valid)
- RPC endpoint: `172.22.45.9:18443` (accessible)
- HTTP JSON-RPC: Working correctly
- Block template fetch: Successful
- Authentication from pool IP: Working

### Note on Previous Errors
The daemon logs showed authentication failures from 20:42:09 (over an hour ago). Current testing confirms authentication is now working correctly from both local and pool IP addresses. Those errors were from an earlier configuration state.

The Bitcoin daemon is fully operational and all RPC functions required for pool mining operations have been validated successfully.
