## Orchestration Decision

**Infrastructure Assessment:**
- Daemon: Running and healthy (342 blocks, wallet funded with 300 BTC)
- Pool: Running and configured correctly (connecting to daemon, broadcasting jobs)
- Configuration files: All exist and properly configured
- Dependencies: Already installed

**Critical Issue Identified:**
The Stratum port (3333) is not accessible from WSL localhost despite the pool showing active connections from 10.0.0.202 in logs. This is a WSL2 networking isolation issue where the pool is binding to Windows network interfaces but not visible from WSL side.

**Strategic Decision:**
Rather than attempting piecemeal fixes, I need to delegate to the **validation agent** first to comprehensively assess:
1. What network interfaces the pool is actually binding to
2. Whether getblocktemplate flow is working between daemon and pool
3. What the correct connection endpoint is for miners
4. Whether the infrastructure is already functional from the Windows side

This will inform whether we need recovery/reconfiguration or if we can proceed directly to miner setup with the correct network path.

DECISION: delegate_validation

REASONING:
Infrastructure shows mixed signals - daemon and pool processes are running, but Stratum port not accessible from WSL localhost despite pool logs showing active connections from remote IP (10.0.0.202). Before making changes or delegating to recovery, need comprehensive validation to:

1. Assess actual network topology (WSL2 vs Windows interface binding)
2. Verify daemon-to-pool RPC connectivity and getblocktemplate flow
3. Determine correct connection endpoints for miner configuration
4. Identify if this is a network configuration issue vs actual infrastructure failure

Validation will provide diagnostic data to determine next action: either proceed to miner setup with correct network path, or delegate to recovery/config regeneration if actual connectivity issues exist between components.

Current state dependencies satisfied for validation:
- Daemon: Running ✓
- Pool: Running ✓  
- Configs: Exist ✓
