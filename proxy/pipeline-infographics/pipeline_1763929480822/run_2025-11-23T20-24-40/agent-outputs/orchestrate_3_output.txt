## ORCHESTRATION DECISION

**Infrastructure State Summary:**
- Daemon: ✓ Running, RPC accessible, 332 blocks
- Wallet: ✗ Not created/loaded, no funds
- Pool: ⚠ Running but non-functional (job creation failures due to wallet issues)
- Stratum: ✗ Port not accessible (blocked by pool errors)
- Miner: ⚠ Not configured (blocked by pool unavailability)

**Identified Root Cause:**
Wallet initialization failure - no wallet created or loaded in the daemon. This blocks all downstream functionality:
- Pool cannot create mining jobs without wallet validation
- Stratum server cannot start without working job manager
- Miners cannot connect without accessible Stratum port

**Error Classification:**
This is a **wallet-specific error** (wallet not created/loaded, no funding) rather than a generic infrastructure issue. The specialized wallet error handler should diagnose and fix:
1. Wallet creation/loading
2. Initial funding (generate 101 blocks to wallet)
3. Wallet RPC accessibility verification

**Dependencies Satisfied:**
- Daemon is running and RPC accessible (prerequisite met)
- Configuration files exist (can be updated if needed)
- All software dependencies installed

**Next Action:**
Route to wallet error handler to:
- Create or load default wallet
- Fund wallet with regtest coins
- Verify wallet RPC operations
- Update pool config if wallet address needs correction
