REASONING:
Current infrastructure state analysis reveals:
- Dependencies: All installed (bitcoind, Mono, cpuminer) ✓
- Configurations: Daemon and pool configs exist ✓
- Daemon: Running in regtest mode, RPC accessible, 342 blocks, 300 BTC wallet funded ✓
- Pool: NOT running - this is the critical missing component ✗
- Miner: Not configured yet ✗

The daemon foundation is solid and operational. Pool configuration exists with proper daemon connection settings (172.22.45.9:18443, credentials configured, Stratum port 3333).

Next action: Start the pool server since:
1. Daemon dependency is satisfied (running and healthy)
2. Pool config exists and appears valid
3. Pool is required before miner can be configured
4. No validation needed yet - infrastructure not complete

Delegating to pool_server_manager to start CoiniumServ.exe, establish daemon connection, and bring Stratum listener online.

DECISION: delegate_pool_setup
