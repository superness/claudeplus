## STATE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Current Infrastructure State:

**✓ DAEMON (bitcoind)**
- Status: **RUNNING** (2 processes, PIDs: 35780, 64119)
- RPC: **ACCESSIBLE** on port 18443
- Blockchain: **OPERATIONAL** (342 blocks, regtest mode)
- Wallet: **FUNDED** (300 BTC confirmed + 1962.5 BTC immature)
- Config: **EXISTS** at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with correct RPC credentials

**✗ POOL (CoiniumServ)**
- Status: **PARTIALLY RUNNING** (process exists but Stratum not functional)
- Critical Issue: **Stratum port 3333 NOT LISTENING** (connection refused)
- Log shows: "Stratum server listening on 0.0.0.0:3333" but port actually NOT accessible
- Secondary Issue: RPC password mismatch errors in daemon logs
- Config: **EXISTS** at default.json with daemon connection settings

**? MINER (cpuminer)**
- Status: **INSTALLED** at /home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer
- Configuration: **NOT VERIFIED**

### Critical Problems Identified:

1. **Pool Stratum Port Issue**: Pool logs claim Stratum listening, but port 3333 refuses connections
2. **RPC Authentication Failures**: Daemon logs show "incorrect password attempt" from 127.0.0.1 and 172.22.45.9
3. **Pool Configuration Mismatch**: Pool config uses daemon host "172.22.45.9" with credentials "coiniumtest/testpass123"

### Root Cause Analysis:

The pool process is running but Stratum is not actually binding to port 3333 despite log messages claiming it is. This could be due to:
- Pool process in failed state but still alive
- Stratum server initialization failed silently after logging "listening" message
- Port binding failed at OS level

Additionally, RPC password mismatches suggest pool cannot properly authenticate with daemon.

### Optimal Next Step:

The pool is in a corrupted state - it's running but non-functional. Recovery is needed to:
1. Stop the dysfunctional pool process
2. Verify/fix RPC authentication configuration
3. Restart pool cleanly
4. Verify Stratum port actually binds

DECISION: delegate_recovery

REASONING:
Infrastructure partially exists but pool is in a non-functional state. Pool process is running but Stratum port 3333 is NOT actually listening (connection refused), despite logs claiming "listening on 0.0.0.0:3333". Additionally, daemon logs show repeated RPC authentication failures from pool connections. This is a classic case of corrupted component state requiring recovery before proceeding. Daemon is healthy and operational, but pool needs recovery to restore Stratum functionality and fix RPC authentication. After recovery restores pool to functional state, will proceed to validation of the complete infrastructure.
