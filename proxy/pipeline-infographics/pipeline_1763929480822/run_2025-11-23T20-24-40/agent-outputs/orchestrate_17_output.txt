## Infrastructure State Analysis

I have analyzed the current infrastructure state and identified several critical issues:

### Current State:
**✓ Components Running:**
- Daemon: Running (PIDs 35780, 51347)
- Pool: Running (PID 36508 - CoiniumServ.exe)
- Block height: 342 blocks
- Wallet funded: 300 BTC confirmed + 1962.50 BTC immature

**✗ Critical Issues Detected:**

1. **RPC Authentication Mismatch**:
   - Daemon config has: `rpcuser=coiniumtest`, `rpcpassword=testpass123`
   - Pool config has: `username: "coiniumtest"`, `password: "testpass123"` ✓
   - BUT daemon logs show: "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt" from 172.22.45.9 (pool's IP)
   - This means the pool CANNOT authenticate with the daemon

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**:
   - RPC port 18443 NOT listening (netstat shows no listener)
   - Stratum port 3333 NOT listening (netstat shows no listener)
   - Despite processes running, critical network ports are NOT bound

3. **Pool Functionality Degraded**:
   - Pool shows recurring error: "Error recaching statistics; The method or operation is not implemented."
   - Pool log shows Stratum client connected (10.0.0.202) but likely can't serve work
   - Pool cannot function properly without daemon RPC access

4. **Configuration Mismatch**:
   - Pool config daemon host is "172.22.45.9" (WSL network IP)
   - Daemon is bound to 0.0.0.0 but authentication is failing

### Root Cause Analysis:

The infrastructure appears to be in a **degraded state** where:
- Processes are running but NOT functionally connected
- RPC authentication is failing between pool and daemon
- Network ports are not properly bound despite processes running
- Pool cannot fetch block templates from daemon due to RPC failure

This is a **handle_rpc_function** scenario because:
1. The core issue is RPC connectivity/authentication failure
2. Daemon and pool are running but cannot communicate
3. This is blocking all downstream functionality (mining, block template distribution)
4. Requires specialized RPC validation and repair

### Decision Rationale:

This is NOT a simple restart or recovery scenario. The infrastructure has:
- Processes running ✓
- Configs present ✓
- But RPC connectivity is broken ✗

Before attempting full validation or declaring infrastructure complete, I must:
1. Fix the RPC authentication/connectivity issue
2. Ensure daemon RPC is accessible to the pool
3. Verify pool can fetch block templates
4. Then proceed to full validation

The RPC validation agent should:
- Diagnose why RPC port isn't listening despite daemon running
- Fix authentication mismatch or connection issues
- Verify pool can successfully call getblocktemplate
- Return control for next steps (likely full validation)

DECISION: validate_rpc_function
