## Framework Fix Complete

I've successfully fixed the framework error in `ScrollingHeaderFix.js` that was preventing the ship movement bug reproduction test from running.

### Root Cause
The error occurred at line 363 in `js/fixes/ScrollingHeaderFix.js`:
```
Uncaught TypeError: window.simulator.objectGrid.updateDisplay is not a function
```

The issue was that the code was calling methods on `window.simulator.objectGrid` without first verifying those methods exist. This caused the test to crash when the ObjectGrid instance wasn't fully initialized or had a different API than expected.

### Fixes Applied
I added proper type checking for all method calls in three locations:

1. **`fixGridObjectVisibility()` method (lines 136-141)**: Added `typeof` checks before calling `collectObjects()` and `updateDisplay()`

2. **`forceRefreshContainers()` method (lines 258-265)**: Added `typeof` checks before calling `collectObjects()`, `updateObjectLists()`, `updateDisplay()`, and `updateCargoDisplay()`

3. **`emergencyGridFix()` method (lines 365-373)**: Added checks for `trackedObjects` existence and `typeof` check before calling `updateDisplay()`

### Changes Made
- **File**: `js/fixes/ScrollingHeaderFix.js`
- **Type**: Defensive programming - added null/undefined checks
- **Impact**: Prevents framework crashes when ObjectGrid methods aren't available
- **Syntax**: Validated with `node -c` - no errors

### Testing Impact
The test infrastructure should now run without crashing. The ScrollingHeaderFix will gracefully handle cases where:
- ObjectGrid isn't fully initialized
- Methods don't exist on the ObjectGrid instance
- The simulator instance isn't ready yet

This fix allows the instant throttle bug reproduction test to proceed past the framework initialization stage and actually capture velocity measurements.
