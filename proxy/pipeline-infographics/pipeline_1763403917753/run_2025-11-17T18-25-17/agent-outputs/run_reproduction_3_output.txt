## Execution Summary

**Test Status**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR - Test infrastructure failure prevented completion

### Evidence Collected:
✅ **Script executed**: node reproduce_instant_throttle_bug.js ran successfully  
✅ **Evidence file generated**: instant_throttle_bug_evidence_1763404116631.json  
✅ **Console logs captured**: 4 entries with errors and exceptions  
✅ **Console log file exists**: 376KB chrome_debug.log file  
✅ **WebSocket command sent**: setThrottle command executed successfully  
❌ **Velocity measurements**: NOT captured (test interrupted)  

### Framework Error Detected:
```
Location: js/fixes/ScrollingHeaderFix.js:363
Error: Uncaught TypeError: window.simulator.objectGrid.updateDisplay is not a function
Impact: Test terminated before velocity measurements could be collected
```

### What Was Captured:
- **Command executed**: setThrottle with value 50%
- **Console errors**: 3 errors, 1 JavaScript exception
- **Ship physics logging**: Active in ShipPhysics.js showing velocity updates
- **Test status**: FAILED (due to framework error)

### Critical Issue:
The reproduction test was interrupted by a UI framework error in ScrollingHeaderFix.js. The test successfully:
1. Launched Chrome with console logging
2. Connected to the game via WebSocket
3. Sent the throttle command

But crashed before capturing velocity measurements, making bug verification **INCONCLUSIVE**.

### Recommendation:
The ScrollingHeaderFix.js error must be fixed before the instant throttle bug can be properly verified. The test infrastructure is functioning correctly (console logs captured, WebSocket commands working), but the game's UI code has a critical error.
