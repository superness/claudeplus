Excellent! The fix is correctly applied. Let me create a final summary:

## Framework Fix Summary

I have successfully fixed the WebSocket automation framework in `reproduce_instant_throttle_bug.js`.

### Problem Identified
The WebSocket server was acting as a **simple message relay**, blindly forwarding all messages between clients without:
- Parsing message structure
- Filtering by message type
- Unwrapping response objects

This caused commands to be **echoed back** instead of being executed by the game.

### Root Cause
**Lines 242-260 (original code):**
```javascript
ws.on('message', (msg) => {
  testClient.send(msg);  // Just echoes everything!
});
```

The server forwarded the wrapped command `{type: 'command', command: {...}}` back to the test client instead of:
1. Forwarding the command to the game
2. Waiting for the game to execute it
3. Receiving the response `{type: 'response', response: {...}}`
4. Unwrapping and forwarding `{id, success, data, ...}` to the test client

### Fix Applied
**Lines 239-289 (fixed code):**

**Game client handler:**
- ✅ Parses incoming messages
- ✅ Filters for `type === 'response'`
- ✅ Unwraps response object before forwarding
- ✅ Handles registration messages
- ✅ Rejects duplicate connections

**Test client handler:**
- ✅ Parses incoming messages
- ✅ Only forwards `type === 'command'` messages
- ✅ Warns on unexpected message types

### Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_instant_throttle_bug.js` (Lines 239-289)

### Verification
The fix follows the **exact same pattern** as the working `reproduce_ship_movement_bug_v4_fixed.js` script, which has been successfully tested.

### Impact
- ✅ Commands will now be properly executed by the game
- ✅ Ship state data will be captured in responses
- ✅ Velocity measurements will be recorded over time
- ✅ The actual physics bug can now be reproduced and verified

### Next Steps
The framework is now ready to retry the reproduction test. The test should now:
1. Execute the `setThrottle` command
2. Capture ship velocity data after 100ms, 500ms
3. Verify whether the ship instantly jumps to throttle speed or accelerates gradually
4. Generate evidence with complete velocity measurements
