Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script that will verify the instant throttle bug. The script:

## Key Features:

1. **Console Logging Enabled**: Uses Chrome's `--enable-logging --v=1` flags to capture all console output
2. **Precise Timing Tests**: Checks velocity at 100ms and 500ms after throttle change to detect instant jumps
3. **Acceleration Test**: Sets throttle to 50% and verifies ship doesn't instantly reach target speed
4. **Deceleration Test**: Sets throttle to 0% and verifies ship doesn't instantly stop
5. **Evidence Collection**: Captures velocity measurements, console logs, errors, and exceptions

## How It Works:

The script tests the core bug by:
- Setting throttle to 50% and checking velocity after just 100ms
- **Expected**: Ship should be at ~10-20% of target speed (exponential acceleration)
- **Bug**: Ship will be at >80% of target speed (instant jump)

If the ship reaches >80% of target speed in only 100ms, the bug is reproduced.

## Evidence Output:

The script will generate `instant_throttle_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json` containing:
- All WebSocket command/response pairs
- Velocity measurements at each time point
- Console logs from Chrome (errors, exceptions, warnings)
- Status: BUG_REPRODUCED or BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED
