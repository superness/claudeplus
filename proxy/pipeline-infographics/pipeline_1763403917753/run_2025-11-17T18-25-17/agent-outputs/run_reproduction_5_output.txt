Same issue - the WebSocket framework is returning the command echo instead of actual game data. This is a FRAMEWORK_ERROR, not the actual bug. 

Let me report the execution results:

## ANALYSIS

The reproduction script executed successfully but encountered a **WebSocket framework error**:

### What Happened:
1. ✅ Chrome launched with console logging enabled
2. ✅ WebSocket server connected to game  
3. ✅ Test client connected successfully
4. ❌ `setThrottle` command echoed back instead of executing
5. ❌ No ship state data returned (velocity measurements empty)

### Root Cause:
The game's WebSocket command handler in `js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js` is not properly responding to commands. Instead of returning:
```javascript
{success: true, data: {throttle: 50, velocity: {...}, ...}}
```

It's returning:
```javascript
{type: "command", command: {id: "1", command: "setThrottle", params: {value: 50}}}
```

### Evidence Quality:
- ✅ Console logs captured (3 entries - GCM auth errors, unrelated to bug)
- ✅ Console log file exists on disk
- ❌ No velocity measurements (WebSocket framework failed)
- ❌ Cannot verify acceleration/deceleration behavior

### Conclusion:
The instant throttle bug **cannot be verified** through automated testing due to WebSocket framework malfunction. The test infrastructure needs to be fixed before the physics bug can be reproduced.

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
