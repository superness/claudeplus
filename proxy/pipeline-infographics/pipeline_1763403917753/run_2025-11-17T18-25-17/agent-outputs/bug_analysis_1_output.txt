Based on my analysis of the code, I can now provide a comprehensive bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ships instantly jump to throttle speed instead of accelerating/decelerating gradually via EVE-style exponential acceleration curves",
  "expectedBehavior": "Ships should gradually accelerate when throttle increases using the exponential formula V(t) = V_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ)), taking approximately 0.5-1 seconds to reach 50% of target speed based on ship agility. Ships should also gradually decelerate when throttle decreases.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ships instantly match the throttle setting without any acceleration or deceleration curve. When throttle is set to 50%, ship velocity immediately becomes 50% of max speed. When throttle changes, velocity changes instantly with no transition period.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "physics",
    "ship movement",
    "acceleration/deceleration",
    "input handling",
    "EVE-style physics simulation"
  ],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in a browser to start the game",
    "Step 2: Select a ship (Atron, Condor, etc.) and start the simulator",
    "Step 3: Press W key or adjust throttle slider to 50%",
    "Step 4: Observe ship instantly moves at 50% of max speed instead of gradually accelerating",
    "Step 5: Press S key to reduce throttle to 0%",
    "Step 6: Observe ship instantly stops instead of gradually decelerating",
    "Step 7: Expected: Ship should take ~0.5-1 seconds to reach target speed with smooth acceleration curve",
    "Step 8: Actual: Ship velocity instantly matches throttle percentage with zero acceleration time"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The bug is caused by either: (1) The targetVelocity is being set directly as the velocity, bypassing the applyExponentialAcceleration() function, OR (2) The time constant (τ) is effectively zero or the exponential factor calculation is broken, making the acceleration instantaneous, OR (3) The velocity is being directly assigned from thrustInput.magnitude * maxVelocity somewhere in the update loop, completely bypassing the physics acceleration system. The physics code in ShipPhysics.js (lines 158-166) correctly implements exponential acceleration with factor = 1 - exp(-k * deltaTime), but something is either skipping this code path or overwriting velocity after it runs."
