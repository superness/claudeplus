## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State:**
- **Dependencies**: ✓ All installed (bitcoind, mono, cpuminer)
- **Configurations**: ✓ Both daemon and pool configs exist with correct settings
- **Daemon**: ✗ Process found (PID 2837) but **RPC NOT accessible** - shutdown in progress per logs
- **Pool**: ✗ Not running
- **Miner**: ✗ Not configured yet

**Key Findings:**
1. A bitcoind process exists (PID 2837) but RPC connection fails with timeout
2. Recent logs show daemon was shut down at 16:52:09Z ("Shutdown: In progress...")
3. Configurations are correctly set:
   - Daemon RPC: username=coiniumtest, password=testpass123, port=18443
   - Pool config matches daemon credentials
   - Stratum port configured as 3333
4. Previous session reached block height 332 before shutdown
5. No port conflicts detected (18443 and 3333 not listening)

**Root Cause Identified:**
The daemon appears to be in a stale or zombie state - process exists but RPC is not responding. This is a classic case requiring recovery before proceeding.

**Dependency Chain:**
Daemon (needs recovery) → Pool → Miner → Validation

## Strategic Decision

Since:
1. Dependencies and configs are already in place (no need for those phases)
2. Daemon process exists but is non-functional (stale/zombie state)
3. This is a recoverable situation (not a fresh install scenario)
4. Recovery agent specializes in handling stale processes and locks

The optimal path is to delegate to recovery agent FIRST to clean up the stale daemon state, then proceed with daemon setup.

**REASONING:**
Infrastructure state assessment reveals:
- Dependencies installed ✓ (bitcoind, mono, cpuminer all present)
- Configurations exist ✓ (bitcoin.conf and pool config.json correctly configured)
- Daemon in stale state ✗ (process PID 2837 exists but RPC timeout, logs show "Shutdown: In progress")
- Pool not running ✗
- Miner not configured ✗

Stale daemon process detected - PID 2837 exists but RPC connection fails with timeout. Logs confirm shutdown was initiated but process remains. This requires cleanup before daemon can be properly restarted.

Recovery agent should kill stale process, clear any locks, then hand back for fresh daemon startup. This is more efficient than trying to start daemon with stale process still present.
