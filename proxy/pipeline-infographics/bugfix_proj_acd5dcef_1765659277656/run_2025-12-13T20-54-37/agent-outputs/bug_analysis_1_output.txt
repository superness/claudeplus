I've now thoroughly examined the game code. This is an American Checkers game where the human plays as Red and the AI plays as Black. I can clearly identify the bug.

---

**Bug Summary**: AI continues playing without returning control to human after executing moves

**Expected Behavior**: After the human (Red) makes one move, the AI (Black) should make exactly one move (or complete a multi-jump sequence), then control should return to the human player. The game should wait for user input on Red's turn.

**Actual Behavior**: After the human makes 1 move as Red, the AI controls both Black AND Red for several turns instantly before returning control to the human. This suggests the turn system incorrectly triggers AI moves even when it's the human's turn (Red's turn).

**Affected Systems**: 
- Turn System (TurnSystem class)
- AI System (AISystem class)
- Game Controller (specifically `executeAIMove` and `scheduleAIMove` methods)

**Severity**: HIGH - This breaks core gameplay and makes the game unplayable as intended

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a new game of American Checkers
2. Make one move as Red (the human player)
3. Observe AI (Black) makes its move
4. Observe that the AI continues making moves for BOTH sides for several turns
5. Eventually control returns to the human

**Likely Source Files**: 
- `client/game.js` (lines 1226-1297 - the AI move execution logic)

**Initial Hypothesis**: 

The bug is in the `executeAIMove` method (lines 1237-1297). The issue appears to be at **lines 1291-1296**:

```javascript
} else {
    // End AI turn
    this.turnSystem.endTurn();
    this.aiThinking = false;
    this.updateUI();
}
```

After `this.turnSystem.endTurn()` is called at line 1293, the turn switches to `'red'`. However, the code never checks whether it's still the AI's turn before continuing. The `this.aiThinking = false` on line 1294 should prevent re-entry, but the problem is that **`updateUI()` is called AFTER `endTurn()`**.

Looking at `updateUI()` (lines 1299-1323), it checks for forced captures at lines 1316-1321. The issue could be related to the `scheduleAIMove` call in `executeMove` at lines 1211-1213:

```javascript
if (this.isAIEnabled && this.turnSystem.currentPlayer === 'black') {
    this.scheduleAIMove();
}
```

However, the root cause appears to be in `executeAIMove` itself. When the AI completes its turn at line 1293, `endTurn()` switches to Red. But there's a race condition or logic error where subsequent AI moves are still being triggered.

Looking more carefully, I see the issue: The multi-jump logic in `executeAIMove` (lines 1286-1290) uses `setTimeout` to continue jumping, but there's no guard to ensure we're still on the AI's turn. If something re-triggers `scheduleAIMove` or if the AI's multi-jump logic incorrectly continues, it could keep executing.

The most likely cause is that **the player's `executeMove` function (line 1168-1224) can also trigger AI moves**, and there may be a situation where both the player's turn completion and AI continuation are racing.
