UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to execute a complete meta-pipeline to build 18 mining cycle automation agents and 8 pipeline templates for a cryptocurrency mining pool system. This involves reading a development plan and generating JSON configuration files, pipeline templates, and documentation following existing schemas and patterns.

APPROACH: 
1. Read the development plan to understand requirements
2. Analyze existing agent and template schemas to understand the JSON structure patterns
3. Systematically generate each of the 18 agent JSON files with appropriate configurations
4. Create 8 pipeline template JSON files that orchestrate the agents
5. Generate comprehensive documentation explaining the system
6. Validate all generated files follow correct schemas and patterns

STEPS:
1. Read `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` to understand specifications
2. Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json` to understand schema patterns
3. Read 2-3 sample agent files to extract JSON schema structure (fields, required properties, formatting)
4. Use Glob to find existing template files in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/*.json` for template patterns
5. Read 2-3 sample template files to understand pipeline orchestration structure
6. Create directory structure using Bash: `mkdir -p` for agents/, templates/, and docs/ directories if needed
7. Generate Infrastructure Agents (4 files):
   - bitcoin_daemon_manager.json
   - pool_server_manager.json
   - miner_manager.json
   - wallet_manager.json
8. Generate Integration Agents (6 files):
   - daemon_pool_connector.json
   - miner_pool_connector.json
   - job_validator.json
   - stratum_monitor.json
   - rpc_tester.json
   - network_monitor.json
9. Generate Validation Agents (4 files):
   - share_validator.json
   - block_validator.json
   - cycle_integration_tester.json
   - performance_analyzer.json
10. Generate Support Agents (4 files):
    - config_generator.json
    - log_analyzer.json
    - error_recovery_agent.json
11. Generate 8 Pipeline Templates:
    - mining-infrastructure-setup.json
    - daemon-pool-integration.json
    - miner-integration.json
    - share-submission-test.json
    - block-discovery-test.json
    - full-mining-cycle.json
    - pool-feature-development.json
    - pool-bug-fix.json
12. Generate documentation in `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/docs/`:
    - agents-overview.md (describing all 18 agents)
    - pipeline-templates-guide.md (describing all 8 templates)
    - mining-cycle-automation-architecture.md (system architecture)
13. Use Bash `ls` commands to verify all files were created correctly
14. Use Grep to validate JSON structure in generated files (check for required fields)

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will verify the development plan file exists and is readable before proceeding
- Will handle cases where target directories don't exist by creating them
- Will ensure existing agent/template schemas are found; if none exist, will ask user for schema examples
- Will validate each generated JSON file has proper syntax (matching brackets, quotes, commas)
- Will ensure agent names are consistent across pipeline template references
- Will test that file paths work on Windows WSL (handles `/mnt/c/` paths correctly)
- Will verify no duplicate agent or template names
- Will check that all 18 agents and 8 templates are created (count verification)

EVIDENCE:
- Output from reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing requirements
- List of existing agent/template files found via Glob showing schema sources
- Sample schema structure extracted from existing files
- Bash output showing successful creation of all 26 JSON files (18 agents + 8 templates)
- Directory listing showing all files in correct locations
- Content snippets from generated files demonstrating schema compliance
- Documentation file creation confirmation
- Final count verification: 18 agents, 8 templates, 3+ documentation files

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High
- High confidence in ability to read plan and existing schemas
- High confidence in generating JSON files programmatically
- Medium confidence because success depends on: 1) existence and quality of the development plan, 2) availability of existing schema examples to follow, 3) complexity of domain-specific mining pool requirements that may need clarification
- The task is well-structured with clear deliverables, but the domain complexity (cryptocurrency mining pools, Stratum protocol, RPC interfaces) may require domain knowledge validation
