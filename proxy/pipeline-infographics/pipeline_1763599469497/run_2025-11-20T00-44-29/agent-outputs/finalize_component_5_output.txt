7. ✓ **Monitor connection state** - Responsibility line 62, RPC endpoint `/status`, monitoring configuration lines 46-51

**REQUIRED DECISIONS**:
All 5 required decisions present and properly defined:
- ✓ `stratum_connected` - Full connection with jobs
- ✓ `subscribe_successful` - Subscribe handshake OK  
- ✓ `authorize_successful` - Worker authorized
- ✓ `connection_failed` - Connection failure
- ✓ `error` - Critical error

**REQUIRED PERMISSIONS**:
All 6 requested permissions granted:
✓ Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

**SUCCESS CRITERIA FROM PLAN (lines 227-232)**:
All 4 plan success criteria met and exceeded with 9 total criteria defined:
- ✓ Miner subscribes successfully
- ✓ Worker authorization succeeds
- ✓ Pool logs show miner connection
- ✓ Difficulty set correctly
- Plus 5 additional criteria (jobs delivery, stability, protocol formatting, etc.)

2. **Metadata Accuracy**: ✓
   - All claimed metadata values confirmed (name, type, group, version, permissions, decisions)
   - 14 responsibilities defined and verified

3. **Stratum Protocol Coverage**: ✓ (10/10 elements)
   - mining.subscribe ✓
