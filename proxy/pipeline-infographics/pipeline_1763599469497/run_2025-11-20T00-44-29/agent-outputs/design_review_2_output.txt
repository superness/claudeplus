ASSESSMENT:

The plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the task requirements. The designer correctly identifies the need to:
1. Read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 specifications
2. Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the project's schema
3. Research existing stratum implementation in the codebase
4. Create a comprehensive agent JSON with proper decision flows

**Strengths:**
- Clear step-by-step approach with logical progression
- Recognizes the need to examine existing patterns before creating new files
- Comprehensive coverage of stratum connection lifecycle (connect → subscribe → authorize → monitor)
- Appropriate tool selection (Read, Glob, Grep, Write)
- Thoughtful test considerations covering error cases, timeouts, validation
- Plans to research both the specification document AND existing codebase implementation

**Weaknesses:**
- The confidence level is "Medium" which shows appropriate humility, but could be stronger given the clear approach
- Step 4-5 (Grep searches) might not yield results if this is a new implementation, though this is a reasonable exploration step

**Evidence Collection:**
The plan specifies concrete evidence that will be gathered:
- Direct references from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2
- Complete agent JSON matching project conventions (verified by examining existing agents)
- Stratum protocol message examples
- Decision flow logic for all 5 specified outcomes
- Connection validation methodology
- Error handling scenarios

This is verifiable and concrete - we can check if the final JSON includes these elements.

**Logical Soundness:**
The approach follows a classic "research → understand → implement" pattern:
1. Read specifications (authoritative source)
2. Examine existing implementations (learn conventions)
3. Research relevant code (understand integration points)
4. Design solution (synthesize knowledge)
5. Implement solution (write the JSON file)

This is a sound methodology for creating a new component in an existing system.

**Completeness:**
All required elements are addressed:
- ✅ Configure miner→pool stratum connection
- ✅ Generate miner connection string
- ✅ Configure pool URL and port
- ✅ Set worker credentials
- ✅ Test stratum subscribe
- ✅ Validate authorize response
- ✅ Monitor connection state
- ✅ All 5 decision outcomes planned
- ✅ All 6 required permissions included

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The proposed evidence is specific and verifiable:
1. Can verify section 2.2 content is incorporated
2. Can verify JSON structure matches project conventions
3. Can verify all 5 decision paths exist
4. Can verify stratum protocol steps are included
5. Can verify error handling is present
6. Can verify the file is created at the correct path

The designer commits to showing concrete examples and logic, not just vague statements.

DECISION: APPROVED

**Reasoning:** This plan demonstrates thorough preparation, appropriate research steps, comprehensive coverage of requirements, and a commitment to gathering concrete evidence. The methodology is sound (research existing patterns before implementing), the scope is complete (all requirements addressed), and the evidence criteria are specific and verifiable. The "Medium" confidence is honest given dependency on examining existing files, but the approach itself is robust enough to handle discovery along the way.

DECISION: APPROVED
