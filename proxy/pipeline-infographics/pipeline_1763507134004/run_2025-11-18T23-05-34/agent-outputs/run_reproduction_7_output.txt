## Key Findings

✅ **Bug Successfully Reproduced**

The test confirms the exact bug described:

1. **playerAwakening persists after reset** - The awakening tutorial state is NOT being cleared
2. **shipLoadouts was cleared** - Interestingly, this key WAS cleared (partial fix working)
3. **Reset function is incomplete** - Only some localStorage keys are being removed

**Evidence:**
- Before reset: `playerAwakening` exists with awakening type "probability_seeker"
- After reset: `playerAwakening` STILL exists with same data
- Reset command returned success but didn't clear all keys

**Root Cause:** The `resetGameState` command (triggered by debug menu) is missing `localStorage.removeItem('playerAwakening')` calls for tutorial/awakening state.

DECISION: BUG_REPRODUCED
