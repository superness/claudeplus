Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the debug menu reset bug. Here's what the script does:

## Test Script: `test_debug_reset_incomplete.js`

### What It Tests

The script reproduces the bug where the debug menu reset function fails to clear critical localStorage keys:

**Test Steps:**
1. **Set awakening data** (`playerAwakening` localStorage key) - simulates player selecting an awakening type
2. **Set ship loadout data** (`shipLoadouts` localStorage key) - simulates player fitting ship modules
3. **Set tutorial flag** (`quantum_controls_seen` localStorage key) - simulates player completing tutorial
4. **Verify all keys exist** before reset
5. **Trigger reset** using `resetGameState` command (proxy for debug menu reset)
6. **Verify keys are cleared** after reset (BUG: they won't be)

### Expected Result (Bug Reproduced)

The test will **FAIL** at steps 8-10 when it checks if the localStorage keys were cleared:
- ❌ `playerAwakening` still exists after reset
- ❌ `shipLoadouts` still exists after reset  
- ❌ `quantum_controls_seen` still exists after reset

### Evidence Collection

The script collects:
- All localStorage keys before and after reset
- Full command/response history
- Browser console logs and errors
- Saves evidence to `bug_evidence_reset_[timestamp].json`

### Key Features

✅ Uses correct template with `testClientServer` and `testClient` separation  
✅ Tests actual localStorage persistence (not just game state)  
✅ Verifies specific keys identified in bug analysis  
✅ Provides clear bug reproduction evidence  
✅ Uses ChromeManager for proper browser automation  

### How This Helps Fix the Bug

This test:
1. **Proves the bug exists** by showing localStorage keys persist after reset
2. **Identifies exactly which keys** are not being cleared
3. **Provides repeatable test** to verify fix works
4. **Captures evidence** for debugging

Once the bug is fixed in `DebugMenu.js` (by adding `localStorage.removeItem()` calls for these keys), this test will PASS instead of reproducing the bug.
