Perfect! Now I have enough information to complete the bug analysis. Let me compile the structured report:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Debug menu reset function fails to clear all game state - tutorial popups, missions, and ship fitting data persist after reset",
  "expectedBehavior": "When debug menu reset is triggered, ALL game state should be cleared including: localStorage keys (quantum_controls_seen, playerAwakening, shipLoadouts, quantumShipLoadouts), tutorial popup flags, mission progress, ship fitting data, and awakening state. Player should experience a complete fresh start equivalent to first-time play",
  "actualBehavior": "The resetPlayerState() function in DebugMenu.js only clears basic game state (position, velocity, credits, resources) and main save files (superstarships_savegame, superstarships_savegame_backup, quantum_controls_seen) but misses critical localStorage keys: 1) 'playerAwakening' (awakening type/state from ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.js:595,1312,1325), 2) 'shipLoadouts' (from ShipFittingUI.js:684,686,696), 3) 'quantumShipLoadouts' (from StationUI.js:1692,1694,1703). This causes tutorial popups to not show again, missions to remain unavailable, and ship fittings to persist",
  "affectedSystems": ["debug", "localStorage", "tutorial", "consciousness_awakening", "ship_fitting", "missions", "UI", "player_state"],
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser and complete initial awakening selection (choose any awakening type)",
    "Step 2: Dismiss the quantum controls tutorial overlay by clicking X (sets localStorage 'quantum_controls_seen' = 'true')",
    "Step 3: Fit ship modules or save a loadout (sets localStorage 'shipLoadouts' or 'quantumShipLoadouts')",
    "Step 4: Complete or start the first mission from tutorial system",
    "Step 5: Open debug menu (Left Control key) and click 'Reset Player State'",
    "Step 6: Confirm reset in dialog",
    "Step 7: Reload the page",
    "Step 8: Observe: Awakening selection popup does NOT appear (playerAwakening localStorage still set)",
    "Step 9: Observe: Tutorial overlay does NOT appear (quantum_controls_seen removed but awakening state prevents it per index.html:2432-2435)",
    "Step 10: Observe: Ship loadouts persist (shipLoadouts/quantumShipLoadouts not cleared)",
    "Step 11: Observe: First mission unavailable or in wrong state"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/debug/DebugMenu.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.js",

    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/index.html"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The resetPlayerState() function in DebugMenu.js:450-566 was implemented before additional localStorage-based systems were added (consciousness awakening, ship loadouts, mission tracking). It only clears the main save game keys and basic state, but doesn't know about the specialized localStorage keys used by individual managers. The tutorial detection logic in index.html:2432-2435 checks for awakening state in save data, so even if quantum_controls_seen is cleared, the presence of playerAwakening localStorage prevents tutorial from showing. Ship fitting systems persist loadouts separately. The fix requires: 1) Adding localStorage.removeItem() calls for ALL localStorage keys, 2) Calling resetAwakeningState() on ConsciousnessAwakeningManager, 3) Clearing ship loadout data, 4) Resetting mission state in StoryManager if present"
}
