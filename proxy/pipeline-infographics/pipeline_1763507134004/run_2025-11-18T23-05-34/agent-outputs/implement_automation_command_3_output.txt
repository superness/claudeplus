Excellent! The implementation is complete. Let me now create the JSON output summarizing what was done:

```json
{
  "commandName": "setLocalStorageKey",
  "implementation": "Added setLocalStorageKey command to enable automated setting of localStorage key-value pairs for testing purposes. The command accepts a key and value parameter, automatically converts objects to JSON strings, and sets the key in localStorage.",
  "filesModified": ["/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js"],
  "registrationAdded": "this.commandHandlers.set('setLocalStorageKey', this.setLocalStorageKey.bind(this));",
  "methodAdded": true,
  "tested": false,
  "notes": "The command follows existing localStorage patterns in GameTestingInterface. It automatically handles JSON serialization for object values, making it easy to set complex state like player awakening or ship loadout data. The command is now ready to be used in the debug reset bug reproduction test."
}
```

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the missing `setLocalStorageKey` command in GameTestingInterface.js. Here's what was added:

### Changes Made:

1. **Command Registration** (line 61):
   - Added `this.commandHandlers.set('setLocalStorageKey', this.setLocalStorageKey.bind(this));`

2. **Method Implementation** (lines 1153-1177):
   - Created `setLocalStorageKey(params)` method
   - Validates required parameters: `key` and `value`
   - Automatically converts objects to JSON strings
   - Sets the key-value pair in localStorage
   - Returns success response with confirmation

3. **Command Description** (line 1348):
   - Added description: "Set a localStorage key-value pair (key, value)"

### How It Works:

The command accepts two parameters:
- `key`: The localStorage key name (string)
- `value`: The value to store (string or object - objects are automatically JSON.stringify'd)

Example usage:
```javascript
{
  "command": "setLocalStorageKey",
  "params": {
    "key": "playerAwakening",
    "value": "neural_architect"
  }
}
```

Or for complex objects:
```javascript
{
  "command": "setLocalStorageKey",
  "params": {
    "key": "shipLoadouts",
    "value": {"loadout1": {"modules": ["laser", "shield"]}}
  }
}
```

This command now enables the debug reset bug test to fully automate by programmatically setting localStorage keys before testing if the reset function properly clears them.
