Perfect! Now let me verify the fixes are complete and test them. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Framework Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `resetGameState` TypeError in GameTestingInterface.js
**Issue**: `ship.physics.position.set is not a function`
**Root Cause**: The ship.physics object uses plain JavaScript objects `{x, y, z}` for position/velocity, not THREE.Vector3 instances
**Fix**: Changed from calling `.set()` method to directly setting `.x`, `.y`, `.z` properties

**Before:**
```javascript
ship.physics.position.set(0, 0, 0);
ship.physics.velocity.set(0, 0, 0);
ship.physics.thrustInput = 0;
```

**After:**
```javascript
ship.physics.position.x = 0;
ship.physics.position.y = 0;
ship.physics.position.z = 0;
ship.physics.velocity.x = 0;
ship.physics.velocity.y = 0;
ship.physics.velocity.z = 0;
ship.physics.thrustInput.x = 0;
ship.physics.thrustInput.y = 0;
ship.physics.thrustInput.z = 0;
ship.physics.thrustInput.magnitude = 0;
```

### 2. Updated test_debug_reset_bug.js to use setLocalStorageKey
**Issue**: Test script had comments saying `setLocalStorageKey` didn't exist, but it actually does exist in GameTestingInterface
**Fix**: Updated test script to use the existing `setLocalStorageKey` command to set up test prerequisites

**Changes:**
- Added 3 setup commands to set localStorage keys before testing reset
- Added 2 verification commands to ensure setup worked
- Removed obsolete comments about manual setup
- Removed conditional logic for inconclusive test results

The test now:
1. Sets `playerAwakening`, `shipLoadouts`, and `quantum_controls_seen` keys
2. Verifies they were set correctly
3. Runs `resetGameState` command
4. Checks if keys persist (bug) or are cleared (correct behavior)

Both fixes are now complete. The test infrastructure is ready to retry the reproduction test.
