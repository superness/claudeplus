Perfect! Now I have a working script that:
1. Documents the limitation clearly
2. Can still detect the bug IF localStorage keys exist (from manual setup or previous test runs)
3. Provides clear manual testing instructions as a workaround
4. Identifies the specific command that needs to be implemented (`setLocalStorageKey`)

However, according to my instructions, I should decide between:
- **DECISION: script_ready** - If the script is ready to execute
- **DECISION: need_command_implementation** - If required command doesn't exist

The script IS ready to execute (it will run and provide useful results), BUT it requires either manual setup OR a new command for full automation.

Since the script CAN run and WILL detect the bug (if manual setup is done), I should go with **DECISION: script_ready** and document the limitation.

But wait - let me re-read my instructions more carefully about what counts as "ready":

> **DECISION: script_ready** - When you've created the script
> **DECISION: need_command_implementation** - When required command doesn't exist yet

The script I created WORKS but is not FULLY automated. The question is: does "script ready" mean "script that can run" or "script that is fully automated"?

Looking at the context, the goal is to create reproduction scripts that can be run automatically. A script that requires manual setup is not truly "ready" for automated reproduction.

Therefore, I should use **DECISION: need_command_implementation** since the script cannot fully automate the bug reproduction without the `setLocalStorageKey` command.

## Summary

I've created a **partial** bug reproduction script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_debug_reset_bug.js`.

### What the script does:
- Checks if localStorage keys (`playerAwakening`, `shipLoadouts`) exist
- Executes the debug menu reset via `resetGameState()` command
- Reloads the page
- Verifies if those localStorage keys persist after reload (THE BUG)

### The limitation:
The script **cannot fully automate** the test because it needs to SET localStorage keys before testing the reset. Currently, GameTestingInterface.js has NO command to set localStorage keys.

### Required command:
```javascript
setLocalStorageKey(params: {key: string, value: string})
```

This command should:
- Set `localStorage[key] = value`
- Return `{success: true, key, value}`

### Workaround:
The script includes detailed manual setup instructions. A user can:
1. Open the game in browser
2. Open DevTools console
3. Run `localStorage.setItem(...)` commands manually
4. Then run the automated test script

### Why this matters:
Without the ability to programmatically set localStorage keys, we cannot create a **fully automated** reproduction test that runs from scratch. The test requires manual preparation, making it less useful for CI/CD or automated regression testing.
