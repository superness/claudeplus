Now I have a complete picture. Let me make my decision on what feature to implement next.

## Next Feature: 3D Health Bars Above Enemies (Billboard Health Bars)

### Already Implemented
Based on my code review:
- **SkillEffects.ts**: Full particle effect system with melee slashes, projectiles, cones, explosions, heals, buffs, auras
- **CombatValidation.ts**: Complete skill validation (range, LoS, energy, cooldowns, status effects)
- **Enemy.ts**: Procedural 3D models for 5 factions, death animations by damage type, health bars (BUT only visible when selected), hit flash feedback
- **CombatFeedback.ts**: Floating damage numbers with size tiers, critical effects, heal/XP/currency/loot popups
- **EnemyAI**: 5 behavior types attacking back
- **CompanionAI**: Using skills with role-based behavior
- **LootVisualization**: Exists

### From Design Docs
**visual-combat-design.md Lines 616-645** specifies:
- Enemy health bars should be **above enemy head**, always visible during combat
- Size scales by threat tier (Minoris 80x8, Majoris 100x10, Extremis 120x12, Terminus 150x15, Apex 200x20)
- **Visibility Range: 30 meters**
- **Fade: Alpha reduces with distance**
- Color matches threat tier (White/Blue/Yellow/Purple/Gold)
- Border thickness and glow effect for elite+ enemies

**Current implementation problem**: Health bars exist in Enemy.ts but are only `visible = false` by default and only show when:
1. Enemy is selected
2. Enemy takes damage (briefly)

The design doc says health bars should be **always visible** within range (30m), with distance-based alpha fade. This is critical for GW1-style gameplay where players need to assess battlefield threats at a glance.

### Why This Feature Next
1. **Core Combat Readability**: The design docs emphasize "READABILITY OVER SPECTACLE" - players must instantly see enemy health to make tactical decisions
2. **User's Explicit Request**: User specifically mentioned "Health bars updating" as incomplete
3. **Missing Core Feature**: Current health bars only show on selection/damage - not the always-visible 3D floating bars that GW1 uses
4. **Dependencies**: Models exist, health tracking exists, threat tier colors exist - just need to make bars visible and billboard properly
5. **High Impact/Low Effort**: Small code change to add always-visible behavior with distance fade
