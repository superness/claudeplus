Now I have a complete picture. Let me verify the extracted requirements against the original design docs.

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Missing Information

The extracted requirements focus ONLY on health bars, but the user's original request was much broader about "Combat working" which includes:

1. **Health bar visibility logic is partially wrong**: 
   - The extraction correctly identifies the issue at Line 1053 (`this.healthBarContainer.visible = false`)
   - BUT the design doc specifies **30 meter visibility range with alpha fade** - the extracted requirements mention this but the current implementation doesn't calculate distance-based fade

2. **Missing from extraction - broader combat visuals the user requested**:
   - Skill visual effects / animations (design doc Section II)
   - Damage numbers floating up (design doc Section III, Lines 450-525)
   - Enemy AI fighting back (design doc doesn't cover this - separate system)
   - Companion AI using their skills (henchmen-heroes-design.md needed)
   - Companions following/positioning (henchmen-heroes-design.md needed)
   - Sound effects (design doc Section VIII)
   - Skill cooldown visuals (design doc Section IX, Lines 1236-1267)
   - Death animations (design doc Section V - already implemented in Enemy.ts)
   - Loot drops visible (design doc Lines 790-795)

3. **Color specification discrepancy**:
   - Design doc Line 573-575: Majoris Blue is `#00BFFF` 
   - EnemyThreatTiers.ts Line 49: Majoris Blue is `#4a90d9`
   - These don't match! The implementation doesn't follow the design doc exactly.

4. **Health bar size specifications incomplete**:
   - The extraction lists pixel sizes but doesn't explain how to convert to world units
   - No mention that these are **billboard** sprites that need to maintain apparent pixel size

### Docs to Check

1. **visual-combat-design.md** - Re-read for:
   - Floating damage number system (Section III)
   - Skill cooldown visuals (Section IX)
   - Sound effect specifications (Section VIII)

2. **henchmen-heroes-design.md** - NEW doc needed for:
   - Companion AI behavior
   - Companion positioning
   - Companion skill usage

3. **combat-design.md** - Check for:
   - Enemy AI attack patterns
   - Combat validation requirements mentioned by user

### Verified Specifications (Correct in Extraction)

- [x] Health bar sizes by threat tier (80x8 to 200x20)
- [x] Visibility range: 30 meters
- [x] Alpha fade with distance concept
- [x] Threat tier HP ranges match (Minoris 80-150, etc.)
- [x] Glow effect for Elite+ enemies (EXTREMIS, TERMINUS, APEX)
- [x] Phase markers concept for boss health bars

### Red Flags Found

1. **Color mismatch**: Majoris Blue in code (`#4a90d9`) doesn't match design doc (`#00BFFF`)
2. **Narrow scope**: Only health bars extracted when user asked for full combat system
3. **Missing distance calculation**: Health bar visibility implementation doesn't check camera distance
