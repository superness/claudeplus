I now have all the information I need to extract the design requirements. Let me compile the full specification.

## Feature: 3D Billboard Health Bars Above Enemies

### Specifications from Design Docs

#### Technical/Visual Requirements (visual-combat-design.md Lines 616-645)

**QUOTE:**
```

│   └── Apex: 200x20 pixels (full screen boss bar option)
├── Visibility Range: 30 meters
├── Fade: Alpha reduces with distance
└── Hide: Option to hide trivial enemies
```

#### UI Specifications (visual-combat-design.md Lines 1269-1300)

**QUOTE:**
```
TARGET FRAME DESIGN

POSITION: Top center

ELEMENTS:
├── Name: Threat tier color
├── Health Bar: Color matches threat tier
├── Level: Number + skull if boss
├── Conditions: Icon row below health
├── Cast Bar: Below conditions (if casting)
└── Distance: Meters to target

HOSTILE TARGET:
├── Border: Red
├── Health: Red fill
├── Threat Icons: Skull for boss, star for elite
└── Attack Indicator: Flashes when attacking you
```

#### Design Philosophy (visual-combat-design.md Lines 11-16)

**QUOTE:**
```
Design Philosophy:
- Readability over spectacle: Players must instantly understand what's happening
- Faction identity through visuals: Imperial gold/white, Tau blue/white, Ork green/red
- Threat clarity: Enemy danger communicated through color coding (GW1 boss naming system)
- Satisfying feedback: Every action has clear visual and audio response
- Performance-first: Effects must run smoothly on mid-range hardware
```

#### Implementation Checklist (visual-combat-design.md Lines 1483-1487)

**QUOTE:**
```
COMBAT VISUAL READABILITY CHECKLIST

ENEMY IDENTIFICATION:
├── [ ] Name plates colored by threat tier (White/Blue/Yellow/Purple/Gold)
├── [ ] Health bars scaled by enemy importance
├── [ ] Elite/boss indicators visible
└── [ ] Faction identification clear
```

#### Current Implementation Problem
From Enemy.ts Lines 1053:
```typescript
this.healthBarContainer.visible = false; // Hidden until selected or damaged
```

This contradicts the design doc which specifies:
- **Visibility Range: 30 meters** - health bars should be visible within this range
- **Fade: Alpha reduces with distance** - gradual fade, not binary visibility

### Implementation Checklist

Based on the design docs:

- [ ] Health bars always visible when enemy is within 30 meters of camera
- [ ] Health bar alpha fades with distance (1.0 at close range, 0.0 at 30m)
- [ ] Health bar sizes scale by threat tier:
  - Minoris: 80x8 pixels (0.8 x 0.08 world units)
  - Majoris: 100x10 pixels (1.0 x 0.1 world units)
  - Extremis: 120x12 pixels (1.2 x 0.12 world units)
  - Terminus: 150x15 pixels (1.5 x 0.15 world units)
  - Apex: 200x20 pixels (2.0 x 0.2 world units)
- [ ] Health bar color matches threat tier (White/Blue/Yellow/Purple/Gold)
- [ ] Border thickness increases with threat tier
- [ ] Elite+ enemies (EXTREMIS, TERMINUS, APEX) have glow effect
- [ ] Health bars billboard to always face camera
- [ ] Option to hide trivial (Minoris) enemy health bars
- [ ] Boss health bars can display as full-screen UI bar option
- [ ] Phase markers for Terminus/Apex boss health bars
