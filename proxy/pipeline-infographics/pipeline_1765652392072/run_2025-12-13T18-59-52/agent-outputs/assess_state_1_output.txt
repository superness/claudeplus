Now I have a complete picture of the project state. Let me provide my assessment.

## Current State

- **Client exists**: YES - Full Three.js-based 3D game client in `/client/` folder
- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation exists:
  - `combat-design.md` - Core combat mechanics
  - `visual-combat-design.md` - Comprehensive visual effects design (1576 lines)
  - `henchmen-heroes-design.md` - GW1-style companion system (1329 lines)
  - `progression-design.md`, `balance-analysis.md`, `balance-audit.md`
  - `systems-integration.md`, `data-model.md`, `api-specification.md`
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express API with:
  - Combat, character, companion, mission services
  - WebSocket combat handlers
  - PostgreSQL database with migrations and seeds
- **Client code**: Substantial Three.js client with:
  - 3D world rendering with third-person camera
  - Player movement and input handling
  - Enemy spawning with templates (all factions: Imperial, Tau, Ork, Tyranid, Chaos)
  - Enemy AI with 5 behavior types (AGGRESSIVE, DEFENSIVE, SUPPORT, FLANKING, SWARM)
  - Companion/Henchmen system with AI (TANK, HEALER, DPS, SUPPORT, CONTROL roles)
  - Combat system with 8 damage types, status effects, armor penetration
  - Combat validation (range, LoS, energy, cooldowns, status effects)
  - Skill system with class-specific skills
  - Floating damage numbers, combat log, loot visualization
  - Audio system with faction themes
  - Party management UI
- **Can run**: YES - Vite dev server (`npm run dev`)

## What's Already Implemented
1. Core 3D rendering and camera
2. Player movement and input
3. Enemy spawning with threat tiers (Minoris/Majoris/Extremis/Terminus/Apex)
4. Enemy AI attacking back
5. Companion AI using skills
6. Basic damage numbers and combat log
7. Skill cooldown system
8. Loot drops on enemy death
9. Audio system framework

## What's Missing/Incomplete (from user's list)
1. **Skill visual effects / animations** - Skills execute but lack visual flair (projectiles, beams, explosions)
2. **Death animations** - Enemies just disappear, need proper death sequences
3. **Health bars updating visually** - Need 3D health bars above enemies
4. **Skill cooldown visuals** - UI exists but needs polish
5. **More combat validation** - User specifically mentioned this needs work

## Recommendation
The client EXISTS and is substantially functional. We should continue implementing features, specifically focusing on **combat visual polish** as the user requested - skill VFX, death animations, health bar improvements, and combat validation refinements.
