I'll analyze this request to determine the appropriate classification.

## Analysis

**User Request:** "CRITICAL BUG: Ship movement is completely non-functional. The player ship does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands. This is a blocking issue that prevents basic gameplay. Investigate the ship movement system, identify why input commands are not being processed or applied, fix the underlying issue, and verify the ship responds correctly to both navigation targets and tap-to-move commands."

**Key Indicators:**
- Explicit label: "CRITICAL BUG"
- Clear malfunction: "completely non-functional", "does not respond"
- Blocking severity: "prevents basic gameplay"
- Action requested: "investigate", "identify why", "fix"
- Verification needed: "verify the ship responds correctly"

**Classification Decision:**

```json
{
  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "This is unambiguously a bug fix request. The user explicitly labels it as 'CRITICAL BUG' and describes existing functionality (ship movement) that is broken. The ship movement system already exists in the codebase but is not functioning correctly. This is not a new feature request, refactor, or simple change - it requires investigation, diagnosis, and repair of broken functionality.",
