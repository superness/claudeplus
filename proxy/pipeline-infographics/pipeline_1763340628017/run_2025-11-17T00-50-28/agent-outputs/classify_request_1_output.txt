  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'This is a critical gameplay bug' and describes a core game mechanic that is completely broken - the ship is not moving at all despite navigation targets being set. The request uses multiple bug-related keywords ('not moving', 'not responding', 'preventing movement') and asks to 'identify why', 'find the root cause', and 'implement a fix' - all classic bug investigation and resolution language. The request provides a systematic debugging approach (check input handling, navigation system, physics system, state management), which is typical of bug fix workflows.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The player ship is not moving at all, even when navigation targets are set and the player taps locations in space to fly to. This is a critical gameplay bug. Investigate the ship movement system to identify why the ship is not responding to navigation commands. Check: 1) The tap/input handling for setting navigation targets, 2) The navigation system that processes these targets, 3) The physics/movement system that should move the ship toward targets, 4) Any state management or flags that might be preventing movement. Find the root cause and implement a fix to restore ship movement functionality. Verify the fix works by testing navigation target setting and ship movement.",
