  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'CRITICAL BUG' and describes functionality that is 'completely broken'. Key indicators include: 'broken', 'does not move at all', 'doesn't work', 'stopped working entirely', and 'regression'. The ship navigation system previously worked but has now failed, which is the definition of a bug. The user provides a clear description of broken behavior (tapping sets target but ship doesn't move) and requests investigation and fixing of the issue.",

    "originalRequest": "CRITICAL BUG: Ship navigation is completely broken. When tapping an object to set a navigation target, the target is set correctly but the ship does not move at all. Double-tap navigation also doesn't work - the ship remains stationary. This is a regression - the ship movement system has stopped working entirely. Need to: 1) Investigate what broke in the ship movement/navigation code, 2) Identify why the ship isn't responding to navigation targets being set, 3) Fix the movement logic so ships properly navigate to tapped targets, 4) Ensure both single-tap and double-tap navigation work correctly, 5) Test thoroughly to confirm ships move to their navigation targets.",
