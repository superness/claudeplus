Now I understand the document structure. Based on the context provided (from the previous stage topic_analysis), a technical document for Bitcoin2 has already been created. The task is to generate thesis positions about creating a similarly detailed technical document for Bitcoin2.

Let me interpret this task - the user is asking for thesis positions about the approach or value of creating such documentation.

**POSITION_1:** Creating protocol-level technical documentation for Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin2 should prioritize documenting deviations from Bitcoin Core rather than duplicating shared specifications, as this provides maximum utility to implementers who already understand Bitcoin's fundamentals.

**RATIONALE_1:** This is arguable because some developers prefer comprehensive standalone documentation while others prefer diff-based approaches. The position can be supported with evidence from developer surveys, documentation efficiency studies, and the practical reality that most Bitcoin2 implementers come from Bitcoin backgrounds.

**POSITION_2:** Detailed mining protocol documentation for SHA256-based altcoins serves as critical infrastructure for decentralization, as it enables independent pool implementations that reduce mining centralization risks inherent in proprietary pool software.

**RATIONALE_2:** This position is debatable because some argue documentation enables attackers as much as legitimate miners, while others contend that security through obscurity is ineffective. Evidence includes historical analysis of pool concentration metrics and the relationship between open documentation and pool diversity.

**POSITION_3:** The most common source of implementation failures in cryptocurrency mining software stems from endianness conversion errors in hash representation, making exhaustive byte-order documentation with worked examples more valuable than high-level protocol descriptions.

**RATIONALE_3:** This is an arguable technical claim that can be supported by analyzing bug reports, GitHub issues, and post-mortems from failed block submissions. Counter-arguments might suggest that protocol-level misunderstandings cause more failures than byte-order issues.

**POSITION_4:** Technical documentation for new cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin2 (launched December 2024) should include explicit genesis block test vectors as the primary validation mechanism, since these represent the canonical "ground truth" that distinguishes legitimate implementations from subtly incompatible forks.

**RATIONALE_4:** This position can be debated - some argue that comprehensive test suites across multiple block heights provide better validation than genesis-focused testing. The position is supportable through analysis of historical cryptocurrency implementation bugs and where they were first detected.

**POSITION_5:** Mining pool documentation that specifies both getblocktemplate and Stratum protocols creates redundancy that serves different implementation needs - getblocktemplate for solo miners and Stratum for pooled mining - and this dual coverage is essential for comprehensive protocol support rather than an inefficient duplication.

**RATIONALE_5:** This is arguable because some developers consider getblocktemplate deprecated in practice and focus solely on Stratum. Evidence includes usage statistics from major mining operations and the historical evolution of mining protocol adoption.
