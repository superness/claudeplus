  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug report. The user explicitly states 'Bug:' and describes a specific broken behavior: ship fitted items are not persisting across game sessions. The items disappear when the game is closed and reopened, which is unintended behavior that breaks core gameplay functionality.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Bug: Ship fitted items are not persisting when the game is closed and reopened. When I fit items to my ship (like Mining Laser I or Afterburner) and then close Chrome completely and reopen the game, all my fitted items are gone.",

      "Create test to reproduce the bug",
      "Test should fit items and trigger save",
