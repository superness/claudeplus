Now I have a complete understanding of the design document. Let me provide the thesis refinement based on the evaluation feedback.

## REFINED_THESIS

**SuperAxeCoin (SAX) is a purpose-built SHA256 cryptocurrency that restores the original promise of decentralized mining by engineering block discovery parameters—120-second blocks, floor difficulty of 1.0, LWMA per-block adjustment, and 500 SAX rewards—specifically calibrated so that Bitaxe hobbyists (500 GH/s–1.2 TH/s) can realistically solo-mine blocks within 24–72 hours, transforming cryptocurrency mining from an industrial oligopoly back into an educational, achievable, and personally rewarding pursuit.**

---

## ARGUMENT_OUTLINE

**1. The Accessibility Argument (Problem-Solution)**
- Bitcoin's 600 EH/s network makes solo mining with a Bitaxe statistically impossible (~45,000 years per block)
- Pool mining abstracts away the core learning experience of blockchain mechanics
- SAX's parameter engineering (2-min blocks, minimum difficulty 1.0, LWMA adjustment) mathematically restores solo mining viability to Bitaxe-class hardware

**2. The Technical Feasibility Argument (Implementation)**
- SHA256d maintains full ASIC and stratum protocol compatibility—no firmware changes required
- LWMA difficulty adjustment (proven in Ravencoin, GRIN) ensures stable 2-minute blocks despite hashrate volatility
- Bitcoin Core fork minimizes novel code, leveraging battle-tested security infrastructure

**3. The Community Value Argument (Purpose)**
- Fair launch principles (no premine, no ICO) align incentives with organic community growth
- Educational value: miners learn real blockchain mechanics with tangible, achievable results
- Fills a specific niche—the Bitaxe hardware ecosystem—rather than competing as a general-purpose currency

## COUNTERARGUMENTS

**1. "Why not just use Bitcoin testnet or signet?"**
- *Response needed:* Testnet coins lack permanence, community value, or psychological reward; signet is centrally controlled. SAX provides a persistent, decentralized network where block discoveries matter.

**2. "Another altcoin adds to crypto fragmentation"**
- *Response needed:* SAX explicitly targets an underserved niche (hobbyist ASIC miners) rather than competing for general adoption. It's a vertical solution, not a horizontal one.

**3. "51% attack vulnerability makes this insecure"**
- *Response needed:* Checkpoints, community monitoring, and exchange confirmation policies mitigate risks. The target use case (hobbyist mining, education) doesn't require Bitcoin-grade security guarantees.

**4. "Large miners will dominate once discovered"**
- *Response needed:* LWMA difficulty adjustment scales to any hashrate. Community ethos and niche focus naturally discourage industrial mining operations seeking ROI.

## WRITING_TIPS

1. **Lead with the Bitaxe owner's pain point.** The 45,000-year calculation is viscerally effective—use it prominently in introductions and abstracts.

2. **Add a "Why Not Testnet?" section.** This is the most common objection. Directly address it with concrete differences: permanence, decentralized control, community value.

3. **Define success metrics.** Add measurable goals: "Success = 80%+ of blocks found by devices under 5 TH/s in Year 1." This makes the thesis falsifiable and rigorous.

4. **Include a governance framework stub.** Even if minimal, acknowledge how parameters could be adjusted post-launch if assumptions prove incorrect.

5. **Add an environmental positioning paragraph.** Pre-empt the "new PoW chain = wasteful" critique by noting SAX's ultra-low power profile (15-25W devices) and educational efficiency.

6. **Create a differentiation table for similar projects.** If other hobbyist SHA256 coins exist, explicitly compare. If none exist, state that SAX fills an unoccupied niche.

7. **Strengthen the FAQ.** The current FAQ is solid but should include: "Why not testnet?", "What happens when big miners arrive?", and "How do you prevent 51% attacks?"
