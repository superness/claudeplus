I've created a comprehensive design document for **SuperAxeCoin (SAX)** at `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`. Here's what it covers:

## Key Highlights

**Core Philosophy**: A SHA256 coin where a single Bitaxe can realistically find blocks in hours/days, not centuries.

**Technical Specs**:
- **Algorithm**: SHA256d (fully Bitaxe-compatible)
- **Block Time**: 2 minutes (faster feedback)
- **Initial Reward**: 500 SAX per block
- **Max Supply**: 210 million SAX
- **Difficulty**: Per-block LWMA adjustment with a floor of 1.0

**Why It's Achievable**:
| Network Hashrate | Bitaxe Ultra Solo Time |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 10 TH/s (10 units) | ~48 hours average |
| 100 TH/s | ~3.3 hours average |

**Document Includes**:
- Complete consensus parameters
- LWMA difficulty algorithm (with code)
- Block reward/halving schedule
- Mining configuration examples for Bitaxe
- Network ports and address formats
- Security considerations
- Bitcoin comparison table
- Implementation roadmap
- Code structure guidance

The document is ~450 lines of detailed technical specification ready for implementation or community review.
