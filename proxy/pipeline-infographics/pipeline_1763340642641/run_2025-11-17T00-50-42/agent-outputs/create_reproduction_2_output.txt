Perfect! A reproduction script already exists and it's well-structured. Let me verify it uses the correct commands and follows the template properly. The script looks good, but I notice it uses a registration-based approach for WebSocket communication which is more sophisticated than the template I was given. Let me create a comprehensive response:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptContent": "Already exists - comprehensive reproduction script with WebSocket automation",
  "commandSequence": [
    {
      "command": "listCommands",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "Verify automation commands are available"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {"includeModules": false},
      "expectedResult": "Capture initial ship position and velocity (should be zero)"
    },
    {
      "command": "setNavigationTarget",
      "params": {"x": 5000, "y": 0, "z": 0, "mode": "approach"},
      "expectedResult": "Set navigation target 5000m away on X axis"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 500},
      "expectedResult": "Wait 500ms for physics update"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {"includeModules": false},
      "expectedResult": "Check if ship has started moving - velocity should be > 0.1 m/s (BUG: velocity is zero)"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 1500},
      "expectedResult": "Wait additional 1.5s for continued acceleration"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {"includeModules": false},
      "expectedResult": "Verify ship continues moving - velocity should be > 10 m/s and distance moved > 10m after 2 seconds (BUG: ship hasn't moved or velocity too low)"
    }
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": ["ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json"],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship velocity remains at zero or very low (<10 m/s) after 2 seconds, and ship position doesn't change (distance moved < 10m). The script tests the complete navigation chain: setNavigationTarget → physics update → ship acceleration → position change. The bug manifests as the ship not responding to navigation commands despite them being set correctly.",
  "howToRun": [
    "1. Ensure game development server is running: npm run dev (or npm start)",
    "2. Run the reproduction script: node reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
    "3. Script will launch Chrome with testMode enabled and execute automated commands",
    "4. Watch console output for test results",
    "5. Check ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json for detailed evidence"
  ],
  "bugDetectionCriteria": [
    "Ship velocity magnitude < 0.1 m/s after 500ms with navigation target set",
    "Ship velocity magnitude < 10 m/s after 2 seconds with navigation target set",
    "Distance moved from initial position < 10m after 2 seconds"
  ],
  "availableCommands": [
    "listCommands - List all available automation commands",
    "getShipState - Get current ship position, velocity, rotation, throttle",
    "setNavigationTarget - Set navigation target (x, y, z, mode) - THE KEY COMMAND FOR THIS BUG",
    "setThrottle - Set ship throttle (0-100)",
    "dock/undock - Dock/undock from stations",
    "getInventory - Get cargo and fitted items",
    "fitItem/unfitItem - Fit/unfit ship modules",
    "setPosition - Teleport ship (debug)",
    "addResource - Add resources (debug)",
    "resetGameState - Reset to initial state"
  ],
  "keyFindings": "The reproduction script is ready to execute. It uses the setNavigationTarget command which directly calls InputManager.setNavigationTarget() - the same code path as double-click/double-tap input. The test verifies the complete chain: navigation target set → physics update → ship acceleration → position change. The bug is detected if the ship doesn't move (velocity near zero or position unchanged) after navigation target is set."
