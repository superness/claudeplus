Based on my analysis of the code, I can now provide a comprehensive bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship is not moving despite navigation targets being set and thrust commands being active. The ship remains stationary even when navigation waypoints are set via double-tap/double-click and thrust levels are modified with W/S keys.",
  "expectedBehavior": "When the player sets a navigation target (via double-tap on mobile or double-click on desktop), the ship should automatically move toward that target at 75% speed. The W/S keys should control speed magnitude (0-100% thrust). The ship's position should update each frame based on its velocity.",
  "actualBehavior": "The ship remains completely stationary. Navigation targets appear to be set correctly (visible in logs), thrust input is being processed, but the ship's position does not change. Velocity remains at zero despite target velocity being calculated.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "input",
    "ship movement"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended)",
    "Step 2: Double-tap anywhere on the canvas (mobile) or double-click (desktop) to set a navigation target",
    "Step 3: Observe the notification 'Approaching coordinates: X, Y, Z' appears",
    "Step 4: Wait and observe - ship should move but remains stationary",
    "Step 5: Try pressing W key to increase thrust - ship still doesn't move",
    "Step 6: Open browser console and check logs - navigation commands show active targets and speed settings, but position doesn't change"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Based on the code analysis, the bug appears to be in the navigation-to-physics data flow. The system has multiple layers:\n\n1. InputManager receives tap/click and sets navigationCommand with target position and speedSetting=0.75\n2. Ship.updateWithNavigation() calculates thrustVector from navigationCommand\n3. ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() receives thrustVector and should update velocity/position\n\nThe bug is likely in one of these areas:\n- The thrustVector.magnitude field may not be preserved when passed between functions (object spread issues)\n- The velocity calculation in ShipPhysics may not be applying correctly\n- The position update may not be executing\n- There could be a state management issue where navigation commands are being cleared before they take effect\n\nThe extensive logging in Ship.js (lines 203-346) suggests this bug was recently investigated, with multiple BUGFIX comments about magnitude preservation, indicating this is a known issue that may not be fully resolved."
