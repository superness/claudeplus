Based on my examination of the code, I can now provide a structured bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship not responding to movement controls - throttle adjustable but ship speed and orientation remain at zero",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player adjusts throttle using W/S keys or sets navigation target, the ship should accelerate in the appropriate direction, update its position, and rotate to face the direction of travel",
  "actualBehavior": "Throttle control responds to input but ship velocity remains at 0 m/s and ship orientation does not change. Ship remains stationary despite thrust input.",
  "affectedSystems": ["physics", "input", "ship navigation", "rendering"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Launch the game by opening index.html in a browser",
    "Step 2: Press W key to increase throttle (observe throttle indicator changes)",
    "Step 3: Observe ship HUD - velocity should increase but remains at 0",
    "Step 4: Double-click on empty space to set navigation target",
    "Step 5: Observe ship - should move toward target but remains stationary",
    "Step 6: Check browser console for errors or navigation logs"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The navigation command flow appears to have multiple potential failure points: (1) InputManager.getNavigationCommand() may not be returning the command properly to Ship.updateWithNavigation(), (2) The thrustVector magnitude may be getting lost during object spread operations (lines 353-359 in Ship.js show a bugfix for this exact issue), (3) ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() may not be receiving or processing the thrustInput correctly, or (4) The physics velocity is updating but the visual mesh is not being rendered (though line 1832 in SpaceshipSimulator.js shows a render() call was added as a bugfix). Based on the extensive debug logging throughout the codebase checking for 'magnitude' corruption and the specific BUGFIX comments about thrustVector.magnitude, the most likely root cause is that the magnitude property is being lost somewhere in the data flow chain between InputManager → Ship → ShipPhysics."
}
