## Test Execution Summary

### Execution Results

**Test Script**: `reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`
**Execution Time**: ~12 seconds
**Test Status**: ✅ EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY

### Evidence Collected

The test automation framework successfully executed all commands and captured comprehensive evidence in file `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763391777087.json`.

### Critical Findings

**BUG STILL PRESENT - Bug Reproduced: ✅ YES**

The evidence shows the ship movement bug is **still present** despite the rendering fix:

1. **Initial State** (Line 14-36):
   - Position: (0, 0, 0)
   - Velocity: (0, 0, 0)
   - Throttle: 0

2. **After Setting Throttle to 50%** (Line 241-253):
   - Position: Still (0, 0, 0) ❌
   - Velocity: Still (0, 0, 0) ❌
   - Throttle: 0.5 ✓ (successfully set)

3. **After Navigation Command** (Line 261-272):
   - Navigation target set: (5000, 0, 5000) at 7071m distance
   - Waited 3 seconds
   - Final position: Still (0, 0, 0) ❌
   - Final velocity: Still (0, 0, 0) ❌
   - **Distance moved: 0 meters** ❌

### Root Cause Analysis

The evidence reveals that the previous fix (adding `sceneManager.render()`) only addressed **visual rendering**, but the ship is **NOT ACTUALLY MOVING AT ALL**. The physics calculations themselves are not being executed or are being blocked.

**Key Evidence**:
- Line 254: `"throttleIssue": "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"`
- Line 273: `"distanceMoved": 0`
- Line 274: `"finalVelocityMagnitude": 0`
- Line 282: `"bugReproduced": true`
- Line 277-280: Bug details confirm ship remained completely stationary

### Conclusion

The rendering fix was necessary but **insufficient**. The actual ship physics update pipeline is broken. The ship is not moving because:

1. ✅ Throttle commands are received
2. ❌ Physics calculations are NOT updating velocity
3. ❌ Position is NOT changing
4. ❌ Ship remains completely stationary

**Further investigation required** to identify why the physics update loop is not processing ship movement.
