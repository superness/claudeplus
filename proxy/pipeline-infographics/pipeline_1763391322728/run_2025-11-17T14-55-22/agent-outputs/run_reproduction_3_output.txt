## Game Runner Execution Report

### Execution Status
✅ **Test Script Executed Successfully**

### Evidence Collected
**File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763391465180.json`

### Bug Reproduction Results

**Status**: **BUG_REPRODUCED** ✓

The automated test successfully reproduced the ship movement bug with concrete evidence:

#### Test Sequence Executed:
1. ✅ Captured initial ship state (baseline)
2. ✅ Set throttle to 50%
3. ✅ Waited 1 second for physics to apply
4. ✅ Checked ship state after throttle
5. ✅ Reset throttle to 0%
6. ✅ Set navigation target to (5000, 0, 5000) at distance 7071m
7. ✅ Waited 3 seconds for ship movement
8. ✅ Verified final ship state

#### Critical Findings:

**Throttle Test (Lines 48-116)**:
- **Initial velocity**: `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}`
- **Throttle set to**: 50%
- **Post-throttle velocity**: `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}` (NO CHANGE)
- **Issue identified**: "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"

**Navigation Test (Lines 150-228)**:
- **Navigation target set**: `(5000, 0, 5000)` at distance 7071m
- **Initial position**: `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}`
- **Final position after 3 seconds**: `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}` (NO MOVEMENT)
- **Distance moved**: 0.00m (expected: >10m)
- **Final velocity**: `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}` (expected: >0.1 m/s)

#### Bug Confirmation:
```json
{
  "bugReproduced": true,
  "bugDetails": {
    "issue": "Ship position did not change after setNavigationTarget command",
    "distanceMoved": 0,
    "expectedBehavior": "Ship should have moved toward target (5000, 0, 5000)",
    "actualBehavior": "Ship remained nearly stationary (moved only 0.00m)"
  }
}
```

### Framework Status
- ✅ WebSocket automation server: **Working**
- ✅ Chrome browser launched: **Success**
- ✅ Game loaded and connected: **Success**
- ✅ All test commands executed: **100% success rate**
- ✅ Evidence file saved: **ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763391465180.json**

### Observations
The test infrastructure is fully operational. All automation commands executed successfully:
- `getShipState` - Retrieved ship data correctly
- `setThrottle` - Command accepted but **had no effect on velocity**
- `setNavigationTarget` - Command accepted but **had no effect on position/velocity**

### Root Cause Indication
The bug is confirmed in the **ship physics/movement pipeline**. The commands are being accepted by the game (success: true), but the physics system is not applying forces or updating position/velocity in response to:
1. Throttle changes
2. Navigation target commands
