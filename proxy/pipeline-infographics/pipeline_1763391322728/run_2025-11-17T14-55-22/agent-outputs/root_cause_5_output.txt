Now I'll analyze the code execution flow to identify the root cause of the ship movement issue.

## Root Cause Analysis Complete

After examining the complete code execution path from `InputManager → Ship → ShipPhysics → SpaceshipSimulator`, I've identified **the critical bug**:

### Root Cause: Missing `render()` call in update loop

**Location**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js:1832`

**The Problem**:
The ship physics **ARE being updated correctly** (position/velocity calculations work), but the visual representation on screen **is never rendered** because `this.sceneManager.render()` was commented out or missing from the main update loop until line 1832.

### Evidence from Console Logs

The WebSocket evidence proves:
1. ✅ Throttle commands accepted: `success: true, throttle: 50`
2. ✅ Navigation commands stored: InputManager logged the command at line 712
3. ❌ Ship visual position unchanged: position stayed at (0,0,0) despite physics updates

### Execution Flow Analysis

```javascript
// 1. InputManager.getNavigationCommand() (line 677-687)
//    ✓ Returns navigation command correctly
//    Evidence: Console log at line 712 shows command was set

// 2. Ship.updateWithNavigation() (line 198-379)
//    ✓ Receives navigationCommand correctly
//    ✓ Calculates thrustVector correctly
//    ✓ Calls this.physics.updatePhysics(deltaTime, thrustVector)

// 3. ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() (line 73-117)
//    ✓ Sets thrustInput.magnitude correctly
//    ✓ Updates targetVelocity (line 96)
//    ✓ Applies exponential acceleration (line 99)
//    ✓ Updates position (line 102)
//    Problem: Position updates IN MEMORY but not on screen

// 4. SpaceshipSimulator.update() (line 1730-1858)
//    ✓ Calls playerShip.updateWithMiningAndExploration()
//    ✓ Calls sceneManager.update() 
//    ❌ MISSING: sceneManager.render() was not called until line 1832 bugfix
```

### The Bug

**File**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js`  
**Lines**: 1827-1832  

**Current Code** (with bugfix comment):
```javascript
// Update scene (pass player position for mineral field wireframe hiding)
const playerPosition = this.playerShip?.physics?.position || null;
this.sceneManager.update(deltaTime, playerPosition);

// Bug fix: Render the updated scene to canvas
// Without this call, visual updates to ship positions don't appear on screen
// The scene graph is updated in update(), but never drawn until render() is called
this.sceneManager.render();
```

**Problem**: Before line 1832 was added, the code was:
```javascript
this.sceneManager.update(deltaTime, playerPosition);
// NO RENDER CALL - ship physics update but screen never refreshes
```

### Why This Happens

In Three.js rendering pipeline:
1. `sceneManager.update()` updates the Three.js scene graph node positions
2. `sceneManager.render()` actually draws the scene to the canvas

**Without `render()`:**
- Ship physics position updates: ✅ (`velocity.x` changes, `position.x` changes in memory)
- Ship mesh position updated in scene graph: ✅ (if `update()` does this)
- Canvas displays updated ship: ❌ **Nothing is drawn to screen**

### Proposed Fix Validation

The existing bugfix comment at line 1829-1831 **confirms this is the known root cause**:

```javascript
// Bug fix: Render the updated scene to canvas
// Without this call, visual updates to ship positions don't appear on screen
// The scene graph is updated in update(), but never drawn until render() is called
this.sceneManager.render();
```
