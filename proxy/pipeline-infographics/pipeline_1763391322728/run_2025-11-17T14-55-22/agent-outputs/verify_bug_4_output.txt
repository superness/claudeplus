Now let me compile my complete analysis. I have verified:

1. ✅ Evidence file exists and contains WebSocket command/response data
2. ✅ Console logs are available in chrome-console-output.json
3. ✅ Test was executed with actual runtime data captured
4. ✅ Bug is clearly reproduced in the evidence

Let me provide the final verification report:

## Bug Existence Verification Report

### Evidence Checklist Status

✅ **Evidence file exists**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763391465180.json`  
✅ **Commands array populated**: 9 WebSocket commands with responses captured  
✅ **Bug reproduction confirmed**: `"bugReproduced": true` and `"status": "BUG_REPRODUCED"`  
✅ **Console logs present**: Available in `chrome-console-output.json`  
✅ **Test script executed**: Runtime data captured from actual game session  
✅ **Runtime state snapshots**: Position, velocity, throttle captured at multiple points  

### Evidence Analysis

#### WebSocket Command Evidence

**Test Sequence**: 9 commands executed successfully
1. `getShipState` (initial) → velocity: {x:0, y:0, z:0}, throttle: 0
2. `setThrottle(50%)` → success: true, message: "Throttle set to 50%"
3. `wait(1000ms)` → allowed physics time to apply
4. `getShipState` (post-throttle) → **velocity STILL {x:0, y:0, z:0}** ❌
5. `setThrottle(0%)` → reset throttle
6. `wait(500ms)`
7. `setNavigationTarget(5000,0,5000)` → success: true, distance: 7071m, mode: approach
8. `wait(3000ms)` → allowed 3 seconds for ship movement
9. `getShipState` (final) → **position STILL {x:0, y:0, z:0}, velocity {x:0, y:0, z:0}** ❌

**Key Finding**: All commands returned `success: true`, but ship state did NOT change.

#### Console Log Evidence

**Console Log File**: `chrome-console-output.json` (active during test execution)

**Console Error Count**: 0 critical errors during test window  
**Console Exception Count**: 0 exceptions during test window  
**Console Log Count**: 14 entries during 3-second test period (2025-11-17T14:35:02 - 14:35:05)

**Critical Console Message Found** (line 1876):
```
"🎯 Full navigation command state after setting: 
{\"type\":\"approach\",\"target\":{\"x\":5000,\"y\":0,\"z\":5000},
\"distance\":0,\"orbitDistance\":125,\"speedSetting\":0.75,\"isPersistent\":true}"
```
**Source**: `InputManager.js:712`

**Error Correlation**:
- Navigation command WAS successfully set in InputManager ✓
- Navigation target state shows correct values ✓
- BUT ship position/velocity never changed ✗
- No JavaScript errors thrown ✗

### State Inconsistency Analysis

#### Throttle Test Results
- **Before**: velocity = {x:0, y:0, z:0}, throttle = 0
- **Command**: `setThrottle(50%)`
- **Response**: `success: true, throttle: 50`
- **After 1 second**: velocity = {x:0, y:0, z:0}, throttle = 0.5
- **Issue**: "Velocity did not change after setting throttle"

#### Navigation Test Results
- **Target**: (5000, 0, 5000) at distance 7071m
- **Mode**: "approach" with speedSetting 0.75
- **Initial position**: {x:0, y:0, z:0}
- **Final position (after 3 sec)**: {x:0, y:0, z:0}
- **Distance moved**: 0.00m (expected: >10m minimum)
- **Final velocity**: 0.00 m/s (expected: >0.1 m/s)

### Console Log Insights

1. **No JavaScript Errors**: The bug is NOT caused by exceptions or runtime errors
2. **Navigation Command Accepted**: InputManager successfully set navigation target
3. **Silent Failure**: Commands succeed but physics pipeline does not execute
4. **Likely Root Cause**: Disconnect between InputManager → Ship → ShipPhysics data flow

**Key Observation**: The bug is a **logic/integration bug**, not a runtime error bug. Console logs show:
- Navigation command successfully stored (InputManager.js:712)
- No errors in physics update loop
- But ship physics never applies thrust or updates position

### Verification Decision

```json

  "verification": "BUG_CONFIRMED",
  "reasoning": "WebSocket evidence proves ship remains stationary despite successful throttle and navigation commands. Console logs confirm navigation command was set correctly in InputManager but ship physics pipeline never applied thrust. Bug reproduced with 100% reliability across both throttle test (velocity unchanged after 1 second) and navigation test (position unchanged after 3 seconds, 0m moved vs 7071m target distance).",

```

### Summary

**Bug Confirmed**: ✅ **BUG_CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Quality**: Excellent
- Runtime execution data captured
