Perfect! The file already exists and has a comprehensive reproduction script. Let me analyze it to provide the structured output:

## Summary

The reproduction script is **ready and comprehensive**. It tests the ship movement bug through two methods:

1. **Throttle Test**: Sets throttle to 50%, waits 1 second, checks if velocity changed
2. **Navigation Test**: Sets navigation target to (5000, 0, 5000), waits 3 seconds, checks if ship moved

**Bug Detection Logic**:
- ✓ Bug is reproduced if ship doesn't move >10m after navigation target is set
- ✓ Bug is reproduced if velocity remains near zero (<0.1 m/s) after navigation target
- ✓ Evidence is saved with all command responses for debugging

**Available Automation Commands Used**:
- `listCommands` - Verify framework is working
- `getShipState` - Get position, velocity, throttle
- `setThrottle` - Set ship throttle percentage
- `setNavigationTarget` - Set target coordinates and mode (approach)
- `getSceneInfo` - Get scene objects
- `resetGameState` - Clean teardown

All commands used are confirmed to exist in `GameTestingInterface.js`.
