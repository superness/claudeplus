I'll analyze this critical ship movement bug by examining the provided context and game architecture.

## Bug Analysis

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship does not move when navigation targets are set via tap/click interactions",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player taps/clicks a location in space or sets a navigation target, the ship should calculate a path and move to that location using EVE-style physics (exponential acceleration curve)",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary despite navigation targets being set. No movement occurs regardless of tap/click interactions.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "input",
    "mobile_input",
    "ship_movement"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in a web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and ship to be visible in space",
    "Step 3: Click/tap on a location in space (should set navigation target)",
    "Step 4: Alternatively, select an object (asteroid, station) and set as navigation target",
    "Step 5: Observe that ship does not move toward the target",
    "Step 6: Check browser console for any errors related to physics, navigation, or input"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/NavigationManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "Based on the git status showing modifications to ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js, and Ship.js, there may have been recent changes that broke the integration between input handling (tap/click detection) → navigation target setting → physics velocity calculation → ship movement application. Possible causes: (1) Navigation target not being passed to physics system, (2) Physics update loop not being called, (3) Velocity calculation returning zero/NaN, (4) Movement disabled by a flag or condition, (5) Input event handlers not properly connected to navigation system, (6) Mobile input manager conflicting with desktop input manager."
}
```

## Critical Investigation Points

Based on the architecture documentation and git status, I need to check:

1. **Input Chain**: `InputManager.js` / `MobileInputManager.js` → Are click/tap events being captured?
2. **Navigation Chain**: Are targets being set in `NavigationManager.js`?
3. **Physics Chain**: Is `ShipPhysics.js` receiving navigation targets and calculating velocity?
4. **Update Chain**: Is the physics update loop running in `SpaceshipSimulator.js`?
5. **Integration**: Are the modified files (shown in git status) properly integrated?

The fact that multiple core movement files are showing as modified (ShipPhysics.js, InputManager.js, Ship.js) strongly suggests a recent change broke the movement integration.
