## Execution Report

### Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Dev server running on http://localhost:8080
- ✅ WebSocket automation server started on port 8765
- ✅ Game connected to automation server
- ✅ Test client connected successfully

### Execution Results

**Exit Code:** 1 (failure)

**Status:** ERROR - Command execution failed

### Observations

1. **WebSocket Connection:** Successfully established
   - Server started: 2025-11-16T23:59:29.402Z
   - Game connected: 2025-11-16T23:59:32.217Z
   - Test client connected: 2025-11-16T23:59:34.236Z

2. **Command Execution:** Failed at first command
   - Command sent: `getShipState` (ID: 1)
   - Response type: `command` (echoed back, not executed)
   - Error: "Response received for command ID undefined: FAILED"
   - Failed message: "Failed to get initial ship state"

3. **Evidence Captured:**
   - File: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337574240.json`
   - Status: ERROR
   - Bug confirmation: null (test could not complete)

4. **Root Issue:**
   - The game received the command but appears to be echoing it back instead of executing it
   - Command response structure shows the command was received as type "command" with the original command object
   - This indicates the game's WebSocket automation handler may not be properly processing commands

### Error Pattern

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": {
    "id": "1",
    "command": "getShipState",
    "params": {}
  }
}
```

The response structure suggests the game is receiving the command but not executing the requested action (`getShipState`). Instead, it's returning the command object itself.
