Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug and the testing infrastructure. Let me create the complete reproduction script with detailed JSON output showing the script path, commands, and expected outcome:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptContent": "Complete Node.js script with WebSocket server that:\n1. Starts WebSocket automation server on port 8765\n2. Launches Chrome with game in test mode\n3. Connects test client to send commands\n4. Executes test sequence:\n   - getShipState (get initial position)\n   - setNavigationTarget (x:1000, y:0, z:1000)\n   - wait 2 seconds\n   - getShipState (check if ship moved)\n   - getNavigationState (debug info)\n   - getInputState (debug info)\n5. Verifies ship moved at least 50m in 2 seconds\n6. Saves evidence.json with full command/response log",
  "commandSequence": [
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "Returns initial ship position and velocity"
    },
    {
      "command": "setNavigationTarget",
      "params": {"x": 1000, "y": 0, "z": 1000},
      "expectedResult": "Navigation target set, speedSetting = 0.75"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 2000},
      "expectedResult": "Wait 2 seconds for ship to accelerate and move"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "Ship position changed by at least 50m (expected ~225m for Atron at 75% speed)"
    },
    {
      "command": "getNavigationState",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "Returns InputManager navigation command state"
    },
    {
      "command": "getInputState",
      "params": {},
      "expectedResult": "Returns full InputManager state for debugging"
    }
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": [
    "ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json"
  ],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship does not move (distance < 50m in 2 seconds)",
  "rootCauseHypothesis": "Based on code analysis:\n1. InputManager.setNavigationTarget() correctly sets navigationCommand with target and speedSetting=0.75\n2. Ship.updateWithNavigation() receives navigationCommand from SpaceshipSimulator.update()\n3. Ship calculates thrust vector from navigation target direction\n4. Ship calls physics.updatePhysics(deltaTime, thrustVector)\n5. POTENTIAL BUG: The thrust vector may not be properly formatted or the navigation command may not be persisting between frames",
  "missingTestCommands": [
    "setNavigationTarget - needs to be added to GameTestingInterface.js",
    "getNavigationState - needs to be added to GameTestingInterface.js",
    "getInputState - needs to be added to GameTestingInterface.js"
  ],
  "nextSteps": "The reproduction script is ready but requires these commands to be added to GameTestingInterface.js first"
}
```

DECISION: script_ready
