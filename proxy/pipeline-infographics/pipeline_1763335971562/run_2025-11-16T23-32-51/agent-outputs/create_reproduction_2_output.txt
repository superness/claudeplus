No syntax errors found. So the bug is NOT a syntax error. Let me go back to analyzing the actual movement logic. Actually, let me just check if the game is even loading properly by checking browser console. But since this is a reproduction script creator, I should create a script that actually tests the movement properly.

Actually, wait - let me re-read the grep output more carefully. The grep I ran showed:

```
202-        / Debug: Log navigation command state
```

But this was from the Grep tool with `-A 100` (showing 100 lines AFTER the match). The `-` indicates it's a context line, NOT the matched line. So this was actually showing code NEAR line 202, not line 202 itself.

OK so there's no syntax error. The real bug must be in the logic. Let me create a proper reproduction script that documents the actual bug:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptContent": "Script already created and ready to run",
  "commandSequence": [
    {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Returns initial ship position and velocity"},
    {"command": "setNavigation", "params": {"x": 1000, "y": 0, "z": 1000}, "expectedResult": "Sets navigation target"},
    {"command": "wait", "duration": 2000, "expectedResult": "Wait for ship to begin moving"},
    {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Ship position should have changed"}
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": ["ship_movement_bug_evidence_*.json"],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship does not move after navigation target is set"
}
```

DECISION: script_ready
