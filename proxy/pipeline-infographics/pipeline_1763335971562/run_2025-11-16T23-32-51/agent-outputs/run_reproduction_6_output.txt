## Execution Report

**Execution Status**: FRAMEWORK_ERROR

The ship movement bug reproduction script encountered an infrastructure failure. The automation framework is missing the required `setNavigationTarget` command handler.

### Observable Facts

1. **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:8080 ✓
2. **WebSocket Server**: Started successfully on port 8765 ✓
3. **Game Connection**: Established ✓
4. **Test Client Connection**: Established ✓
5. **Command Execution**: FAILED

### Error Details

```
Command: setNavigationTarget
Parameters: {x: 5000, y: 0, z: 5000}
Error: Command not recognized by GameTestingInterface
```

### Root Cause

The `GameTestingInterface.js` (automation command handler) only registers these commands:
- getShipState
- getSceneInfo
- setThrottle
- dock/undock
- getInventory
- fitItem/unfitItem
- setPosition
- addResource
- triggerCombat
- resetGameState
- executeBatch
- listCommands

**Missing**: `setNavigationTarget` - The reproduction script requires this command, but it's not implemented in the automation framework.

### Code Evidence

From `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:25-48`, the `registerCommandHandlers()` method does not include a navigation command handler, even though `setNavigationTarget()` exists in `js/core/InputManager.js:setNavigationTarget()`.
