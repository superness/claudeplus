# Bug Existence Verification Report

## Evidence Analysis

### Runtime Evidence Present: ❌ NO

**Critical Problem**: The reproduction attempt failed due to a **test framework error**, NOT because the bug was tested and failed to reproduce.

### WebSocket Evidence Review

From the evidence file `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763336904595.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "COMMAND_FAILED",
  "failedCommand": {
    "command": "setNavigationTarget",
    "response": {
      "type": "command",  // ❌ Should be "response"
      "command": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

**What Happened**:
1. Test script tried to send `setNavigationTarget` command
2. Game echoed the command back instead of executing it
3. `GameTestingInterface.js` doesn't have a handler for `setNavigationTarget`
4. Test failed before any actual bug testing occurred

**Available Commands in Framework**:
- getShipState ✅
- getSceneInfo ✅
- setThrottle ✅
- setPosition ✅
- **setNavigationTarget ❌ MISSING**

### Verification Decision

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "Cannot verify bug existence because the test framework lacks the 'setNavigationTarget' command handler. The test failed before it could interact with the navigation system. This is a test infrastructure problem, not evidence about the reported bug.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "Command echoed back, not executed (framework error)",
    "stateInconsistency": "N/A - navigation target never set",
    "matchesBugReport": false,
    "actualProblem": "Missing command handler in GameTestingInterface.js"
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Option 1: Add 'setNavigationTarget' command to GameTestingInterface.js and re-run test",
    "Option 2: Use existing 'setPosition' command as workaround (move ship, check if it moves)",
    "Option 3: Manually test in browser with DevTools console",
    "Option 4: Skip WebSocket testing and proceed to code investigation"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Proceed with manual investigation of ship movement code in ShipPhysics.js, NavigationManager.js, and InputManager.js. The WebSocket test framework is incomplete for navigation testing."
}
```

## Why This Is Inconclusive

❌ **No runtime evidence** - Test didn't run successfully  
❌ **No state snapshots** - Navigation target never set  
❌ **No velocity data** - Physics system never engaged  
❌ **Framework limitation** - Missing command handler prevented testing  

## Recommended Action

**Skip WebSocket reproduction** and proceed directly to:

1. **Code Investigation**: Read ShipPhysics.js, NavigationManager.js, InputManager.js
2. **Manual Browser Testing**: Open game, use DevTools console to test movement
3. **Fix Missing Handler**: Add `setNavigationTarget` to GameTestingInterface.js for future tests

The bug report is credible (critical gameplay issue), but we cannot confirm it via automation with the current test framework limitations.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence - test framework incomplete)
