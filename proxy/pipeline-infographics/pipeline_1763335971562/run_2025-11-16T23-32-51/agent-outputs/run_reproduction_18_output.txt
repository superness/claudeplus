The evidence shows the WebSocket connection established successfully, but the game is not responding properly to commands. The response is echoing the command back instead of returning actual data. This indicates the WebSocket automation handler in the game may not be implemented or may be malfunctioning.

## Execution Report

**Execution Status:** Completed  
**Exit Code:** 1  
**Dev Server:** Running on http://localhost:8080  
**WebSocket Server:** Started successfully on port 8765  
**Game Connection:** Connected successfully  
**Test Client:** Connected successfully  
**Commands Executed:** 1 (getShipState)  
**Evidence File:** ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337768968.json

### Observable Facts

1. **Infrastructure Success:**
   - WebSocket automation server started on port 8765
   - Game connected to automation server at 2025-11-17T00:02:46.949Z
   - Test client connected successfully at 2025-11-17T00:02:48.965Z

2. **Command Failure:**
   - Sent command: `getShipState` (ID: 1)
   - Response received: Echo of command instead of actual game state data
   - Response structure: `{"type":"command","command":{"id":"1","command":"getShipState","params":{}}}`
   - Expected response structure: Should contain `{success: true/false, data: {...ship state...}}`

3. **Error Details:**
   - Command failed with error: "undefined"
   - Response ID: undefined
   - Status: FAILED

4. **Root Cause:**
   - The game is echoing commands back to the test client instead of processing them
   - The WebSocket automation command handler is either not implemented or not functioning
   - The game needs a command processing system that:
     - Receives commands via WebSocket
     - Executes the command in the game context
     - Returns structured responses with success/failure and data

5. **Evidence Generated:**
   - File: ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337768968.json
   - Status: ERROR
   - Contains full command/response log and observations
