Perfect! Now let me create a summary document:

## Ship Movement Bug Reproduction Script - Complete

I've created a comprehensive automated reproduction script for the ship movement bug using the game's WebSocket automation framework.

### Script Details

**Script Path:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`

**What it does:**
1. Starts a WebSocket automation server on port 8765
2. Launches Chrome with the game (`?testMode=true`)
3. Waits for game to connect to automation server
4. Executes automated test sequence:
   - Get initial ship state (position, velocity)
   - Set navigation target 1000 units away
   - Wait 5 seconds for physics updates
   - Get final ship state
   - Compare initial vs final state
5. Detects bug by checking if position/velocity changed
6. Saves comprehensive evidence JSON file

### Command Sequence

```javascript
[
  {command: 'getShipState', params: {}},                    // Get baseline
  {command: 'setNavigationTarget', params: {x: 1000, y: 0, z: 0}}, // Set target
  // Wait 5 seconds for physics
  {command: 'getShipState', params: {}}                     // Check if moved
]
```

### Bug Detection Logic

**Bug is CONFIRMED if:**
- Position change magnitude < 1.0 units
- Velocity change magnitude < 0.1 m/s
- Both conditions true after 5 seconds

**Expected behavior:**
- Ship should accelerate toward target using EVE-style physics
- Velocity should increase exponentially
- Position should change as ship moves

### How to Run

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install ws

# Run the reproduction script
node reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js
```

### Output

**If bug is present:**
```
============================================================
BUG REPRODUCTION SUCCESSFUL
============================================================
Evidence: ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337257327.json
============================================================
Exit code: 1
```

**If ship movement works:**
```
============================================================
TEST PASSED: Ship movement working
============================================================
Evidence: ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337257327.json
============================================================
Exit code: 0
```

### Evidence File

Contains complete test data:
- All commands sent and responses received
- Initial and final ship state (position, velocity)
- Calculated deltas (position change, velocity change)
- Bug detection results
- Full observation log with timestamps

### Exit Codes

- **0** - Test passed (ship movement working) OR bug successfully reproduced
- **1** - Bug confirmed (ship not moving)
- **Error codes** - Test failed to execute

### Documentation

**Guide:** `SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` (already exists)

Contains:
- Detailed bug description
- Manual reproduction steps
- Debugging strategies
- Root cause investigation guide
- WebSocket automation architecture

### Files Created/Modified

1. ✅ `reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js` - Main reproduction script
2. ✅ `SHIP_MOVEMENT_BUG_REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide (existing)

**DECISION: script_ready**

The ship movement bug reproduction script is complete and ready to execute. It uses the game's WebSocket automation framework to:
- Automatically launch the game
- Execute navigation target commands
- Measure ship movement over 5 seconds
- Detect if the bug is present
- Save detailed evidence files

The script will exit with code 1 if the bug is reproduced (ship doesn't move) or code 0 if ship movement is working correctly.
