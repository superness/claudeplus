## Evidence Analysis

{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "The WebSocket automation test did NOT successfully execute game commands. The test infrastructure connected properly but the game echoed commands back instead of processing them. No actual ship state data was captured, no movement commands were issued, and no ship behavior was observed.",

  "nextSteps": "Cannot verify ship movement bug via WebSocket automation until the automation command handler is implemented in the game. Need to either: (1) Implement WebSocket command processing in the game, OR (2) Use manual browser testing to reproduce the bug, OR (3) Use browser console inspection and JavaScript injection to verify ship movement behavior."
}
```

## Conclusion

The WebSocket automation approach **failed to reproduce the bug** because the automation infrastructure itself is incomplete. The evidence shows:

1. ✅ **Infrastructure worked**: WebSocket server started, game connected, test client connected
2. ❌ **Command processing failed**: Game has no command handler implementation
3. ❌ **No runtime evidence collected**: Zero ship state snapshots, zero movement tests executed
4. ❌ **Bug not tested**: Cannot confirm or deny ship movement bug without actually testing it

This is **NOT** runtime evidence of the ship movement bug - it's evidence that the testing automation itself is broken.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence of ship movement bug - automation system failed to execute tests)
