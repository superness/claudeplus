Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The `setNavigationTarget` command is **NOT** implemented in the GameTestingInterface.js. The evidence confirms this. Let me now create a complete execution report:

## Execution Report

### Test Execution Status: ✓ COMPLETED

**Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:8080
**WebSocket Server**: Started successfully on port 8765

### Observable Facts

1. ✓ WebSocket automation infrastructure is functioning correctly
2. ✓ Game launched successfully in Chrome with test mode enabled
3. ✓ Automation server-client connection established
4. ❌ `setNavigationTarget` command does not exist in GameTestingInterface.js command handlers (lines 25-48)
5. ✓ Script executed to completion and generated evidence file
