I'll analyze the evidence from the WebSocket automation test run to verify if this bug can be confirmed.

## Evidence Analysis

### Runtime Evidence Present: ✅ YES

**Evidence File**: `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763337257327.json`
**Test Execution**: Completed with WebSocket automation
**Dev Server**: http://localhost:8080
**WebSocket Server**: Port 8765
**Game Connection**: ✓ Successful
**Automation Connection**: ✓ Successful

### Test Results

**Command Attempted**: `setNavigationTarget` with params `{x: 5000, y: 0, z: 5000}`
**Expected Result**: Ship receives navigation target and begins moving
**Actual Result**: ❌ Command handler not found

### Critical Finding

The WebSocket automation test revealed a **fundamental issue**:

```
Command: setNavigationTarget
Status: FAILED
Error: Command handler not found in command registry
```

**Analysis of GameTestingInterface.js** (lines 25-48):
- ✓ `getShipState` exists
- ✓ `setThrottle` exists
- ✓ `dock` exists
- ✓ `setPosition` exists
- ❌ `setNavigationTarget` **DOES NOT EXIST**

### Evidence Interpretation

This evidence reveals **two distinct issues**:

1. **Testing Infrastructure Gap**: The `setNavigationTarget` command is not implemented in the testing interface, preventing automated verification of navigation functionality via WebSocket commands.

2. **Original Bug Status**: **INCONCLUSIVE** - The test could not execute because the testing command doesn't exist, so we have **no runtime evidence** about whether the actual game navigation system works or is broken.

### Why This Is INCONCLUSIVE

```json
{
  "runtimeEvidencePresent": true,
  "websocketResponses": "Command 'setNavigationTarget' not found in registry",
  "stateInconsistency": "Cannot verify - command never executed",
  "matchesBugReport": false,
  "testingInfrastructureIssue": true,
  "actualGameBehaviorTested": false
}
```

The WebSocket automation **successfully connected** and **attempted to run commands**, but the specific command needed to test navigation (`setNavigationTarget`) is **not implemented in the testing interface**.

### What We Know vs. What We Don't Know

**✓ Confirmed by Runtime Evidence**:
- WebSocket automation framework is functional
- Game loads successfully
- Ship state can be queried
- Other commands (dock, setThrottle, etc.) are available

**❌ NOT Confirmed by Runtime Evidence**:
- Whether ship movement works or is broken
- Whether navigation target setting works
- Whether the original bug exists

### Verification Decision

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "WebSocket test executed but cannot verify ship movement bug because setNavigationTarget command is not implemented in GameTestingInterface.js testing framework. The test failed due to missing test infrastructure, not due to the bug itself. No runtime evidence was collected about whether the ship actually moves when navigation targets are set through the game's normal UI/input systems.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": true,
    "websocketResponses": "setNavigationTarget command not found (lines 25-48 of GameTestingInterface.js)",
    "stateInconsistency": "Cannot determine - command was never executed",
    "matchesBugReport": false,
    "testingGap": "Testing interface missing navigation command handler"
  },
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Option 1: Implement setNavigationTarget in GameTestingInterface.js and re-run test",
    "Option 2: Test ship movement manually through browser UI (tap/click navigation)",
    "Option 3: Add console logging to NavigationManager.js and observe browser console during manual testing",
    "Option 4: Use existing setPosition command to teleport ship and verify physics engine works independently"
  ]
}
```

### Recommendation

To properly verify this bug, you need to either:

1. **Add the missing test command**: Implement `setNavigationTarget` in GameTestingInterface.js (around line 30) and re-run the automation test
2. **Manual browser testing**: Open index.html, click/tap in space, and observe console logs for navigation/physics errors
3. **Alternative automated test**: Use `setThrottle` command to test if physics movement works at all (bypasses navigation system)

The current evidence proves the **testing infrastructure has a gap**, but does **not prove or disprove** the existence of the ship movement bug.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (no runtime evidence about actual ship movement behavior)
