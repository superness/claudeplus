Perfect! I've created a comprehensive reproduction script for the ship movement bug. Here's what the script does:

## Reproduction Script Summary

**File:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`

### Command Sequence

The script executes the following automated test sequence:

1. **Get initial ship state** - Records starting position and velocity
2. **Set navigation target** - Commands ship to fly to position (5000, 0, 5000) - 5km away
3. **Wait 2 seconds** - Allows physics system time to update
4. **Get ship state after 2s** - Checks if ship has moved
5. **Verify movement** - Calculates distance moved and determines if bug exists
6. **Get physics diagnostics** - Captures internal physics engine state
7. **Get navigation diagnostics** - Captures navigation system state

### Expected Behavior vs Bug Detection

- **Normal behavior:** Ship should move >10m in 2 seconds after setting navigation target
- **Bug detected:** If ship moves <10m, the bug is reproduced

### Evidence Output

The script generates a timestamped JSON evidence file with:
- Initial and final ship positions
- Initial and final velocities  
- Distance moved calculation
- Navigation target details
- Physics system state
- Navigation system state
- Complete command/response log

### How to Run

```bash
# Start local server first
npm start

# In another terminal, run the reproduction script
node /mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js
```

### What Happens

1. Script starts WebSocket automation server on port 8765
2. Launches Chrome with game in test mode
3. Waits for game to connect
4. Executes automated command sequence
5. Detects if ship movement bug exists
6. Saves detailed evidence to `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
7. Exits with code 0 if bug reproduced, code 1 if unexpected error

### Output Format

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "commandSequence": [
    {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "position and velocity captured"},
    {"command": "setNavigationTarget", "expectedResult": "navigation target set to (5000,0,5000)"},
    {"command": "wait", "expectedResult": "2 second delay for physics"},
    {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "ship should have moved >10m"},
    {"command": "getPhysicsDiagnostics", "expectedResult": "physics state captured"},
    {"command": "getNavigationDiagnostics", "expectedResult": "navigation state captured"}
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": ["ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json"],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship does not move after navigation target set"
}
```

The script is ready to execute and will systematically test all aspects of the ship movement chain (input → navigation → physics → movement) to identify exactly where the bug occurs.
