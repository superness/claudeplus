### Evidence Collected

**Command Execution Log:**

1. **getShipState** - ❌ FAILED
   - Request: `getShipState {}`
   - Response: `undefined`
   - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')`
   - Location: `reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js:93`

}
```

### Observations

1. WebSocket automation infrastructure working correctly
2. Game successfully connected to automation server
3. Test client connected successfully
4. **First command (`getShipState`) returned `undefined`** - Game not responding with expected data structure
5. Script crashed when trying to read `.position` property from undefined response
6. Evidence file shows different command (`setThrottle`) which also failed
7. No state snapshots captured due to early failure

### Root Cause Indicator

The game's WebSocket automation handler is not returning proper responses to commands:
- `getShipState` command sent → response is `undefined`
- Expected: Response object with `position` property
- Actual: `undefined` response causes TypeError

This indicates the game's automation command handler may not be properly implementing the `getShipState` command or the response format is incorrect.
