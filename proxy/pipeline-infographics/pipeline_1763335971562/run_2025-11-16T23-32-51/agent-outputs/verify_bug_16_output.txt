## Verification Analysis

### Evidence Examination

**Runtime Evidence Present:** ❌ NO

The evidence file shows:

1. **WebSocket Automation Framework Status:**
   - ✅ Server started successfully
   - ✅ Game connected to automation server
   - ✅ Test client connected

2. **Command Execution:**
   - ❌ First command (`getShipState`) **FAILED**
   - Response: Game echoed the command back instead of executing it
   - Error: "Response received for command ID undefined: FAILED"

3. **Game State Snapshots:**
   - ❌ NO ship state captured
   - ❌ NO navigation target data
   - ❌ NO velocity/position data
   - ❌ NO movement verification possible

4. **Bug Verification:**
   - `bugConfirmed: null` (test could not complete)
   - Status: ERROR
   - Test aborted after first command failure

### Critical Issue

The WebSocket automation framework itself is not working correctly:
- The game's command handler is **echoing commands back** instead of **executing them**
- This is a **framework integration bug**, not the ship movement bug
- The test could not proceed beyond the first command

### Evidence Requirements Not Met

According to the verification requirements:

**❌ ALWAYS RETURN "INCONCLUSIVE" IF:**
- ✅ No game state snapshots captured ← **TRUE**
- ✅ Evidence.json shows test execution failure ← **TRUE**
- ✅ No actual game behavior data ← **TRUE**

**Missing Critical Evidence:**
- No ship position before/after navigation target set
- No velocity calculations captured
- No movement commands executed
- No tap/click event data
- No physics system state

### Analysis

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "WebSocket automation framework failed at first command. The game's command handler echoed the 'getShipState' command back instead of executing it and returning ship state data. Test aborted before any ship movement behavior could be captured.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "Command handler echoing instead of executing (framework bug)",
    "stateInconsistency": "No state captured - test failed before execution",
    "matchesBugReport": "Cannot verify - no movement data collected",
    "frameworkIssue": "Game WebSocket command handler not processing commands correctly"
  },
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Fix WebSocket command handler in game code (likely in SpaceshipSimulator.js or automation integration)",
    "Verify command handler properly processes 'getShipState', 'setNavigationTarget', etc.",
    "Re-run reproduction test after framework fix",
    "Then analyze actual ship movement behavior"
  ],
  "technicalNotes": "The automation framework connected successfully but the game-side command handler is broken. The response structure shows the command was received as type 'command' with the original command object nested inside, suggesting the handler is passing through commands instead of executing them. This must be fixed before ship movement bug can be verified."
}
```

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence - WebSocket automation framework failed before ship movement could be tested)
