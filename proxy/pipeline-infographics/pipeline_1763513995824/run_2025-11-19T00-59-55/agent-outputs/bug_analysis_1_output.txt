Perfect! Now I have the complete picture. Let me create the bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Active Mission UI tracker (mission-tracker-ui) does not update when PlayerProgressionManager completes objectives because there is no communication between PlayerProgressionManager and ConsciousnessAwakeningManager",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a player completes a mission objective (e.g., crafts and equips a module), the mission tracker UI should update to show ✅ for completed objectives",
  "actualBehavior": "The mission tracker UI remains static showing ⬜ for objectives even after they are completed. PlayerProgressionManager correctly tracks completion internally, but the ConsciousnessAwakeningManager's updateMissionTrackerUI() method is never called",
  "affectedSystems": ["PlayerProgressionManager", "ConsciousnessAwakeningManager", "Mission Tracker UI", "Event System"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser and start playing",
    "Step 2: Verify you are in 'capsuleer_cadet' phase with 'first_crafting' objective active",
    "Step 3: Craft a module (e.g., basic afterburner) - recordModuleCrafted() is called",
    "Step 4: Dock at station and fit the crafted module to your ship - recordModuleFitted() is called",
    "Step 5: Observe mission tracker UI (mission-tracker-ui div in top-right)",
    "Step 6: BUG: Objective still shows ⬜ instead of ✅ even though objective is complete"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/PlayerProgressionManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "ROOT CAUSE: PlayerProgressionManager and ConsciousnessAwakeningManager are completely separate systems with no communication mechanism. The mission tracker UI is owned by ConsciousnessAwakeningManager (updateMissionTrackerUI method), but mission objectives are tracked by PlayerProgressionManager. When PlayerProgressionManager.completeObjective() is called (line 687), it updates the objective.completed flag and shows a notification, but it NEVER calls updateMissionTrackerUI() to refresh the visual tracker. The UI therefore shows stale data and never reflects the actual completion status. The fix requires either: (1) PlayerProgressionManager calling ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.updateMissionTrackerUI() after completing objectives, or (2) Setting up an event system where PlayerProgressionManager emits 'objectiveCompleted' events that ConsciousnessAwakeningManager listens to and responds by updating the UI."
}
```
