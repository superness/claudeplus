Excellent! The fix is complete. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Framework Fix Summary

### Problem Identified
The test automation script `test_active_mission_ui_update_bug.js` contained incorrect test data that caused it to fail before reaching the actual UI update bug.

### Root Cause
- **Line 93**: Used blueprint ID `basic_afterburner` (incorrect)
- **Correct ID**: Should be `basic_afterburner_bp` (with `_bp` suffix)

### Fix Applied
Changed line 93 from:
```javascript
params: { blueprintId: 'basic_afterburner', quantity: 1 },
```

To:
```javascript
params: { blueprintId: 'basic_afterburner_bp', quantity: 1 },
```

Also updated the description (line 102) to clarify the blueprint ID being used.

### Verification
- ✅ Checked all other test files - they all use `basic_afterburner_bp` correctly
- ✅ Verified no other references to `basic_afterburner` without `_bp` suffix remain in the test
- ✅ This matches the pattern used in 5 other working test files

### Expected Result
With this fix:
1. The test should now successfully start a crafting job
2. Complete the crafting sequence (craft → dock → fit)
3. Reach the actual bug verification steps (steps 11+)
4. Properly reproduce the UI update bug (mission tracker not updating)

The framework error has been resolved. The test can now proceed to validate the actual Active Mission UI update bug.
