Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the fix implementation:

  "expectedImpact": "When players complete objectives (like crafting and equipping a module), the mission tracker UI will immediately update to show ✅ instead of ⬜. The objective completion will now properly trigger a UI refresh.",
  "riskAssessment": "Low risk - Uses optional chaining (?.) for safe method calls, adds setter method that can be called anytime, and preserves all existing functionality. The connection is established after both systems are initialized, preventing null reference errors.",
  "additionalNotes": "The fix addresses the root cause: two isolated mission tracking systems (PlayerProgressionManager and ConsciousnessAwakeningManager) that couldn't communicate. Now when PlayerProgressionManager detects objective completion, it notifies ConsciousnessAwakeningManager to update the UI. Future improvement: Consider implementing an event-driven architecture for better decoupling."
}
```

The fix has been successfully implemented! Here's what was done:

## Changes Made:

1. **PlayerProgressionManager.js (Constructor)**: Added optional `consciousnessAwakeningManager` parameter to store reference
2. **PlayerProgressionManager.js (New Method)**: Added `setConsciousnessAwakeningManager()` setter to establish connection after initialization
3. **PlayerProgressionManager.js (completeObjective)**: Added call to `updateMissionTrackerUI()` when objectives are completed
4. **index.html (Initialization)**: Connected the two systems after ConsciousnessAwakeningManager is initialized

## How It Works:

1. PlayerProgressionManager is created first (during simulator initialization)
2. ConsciousnessAwakeningManager is created later (in index.html)
3. The setter method connects them: `simulator.playerProgressionManager.setConsciousnessAwakeningManager(consciousnessAwakeningManager)`
4. When an objective is completed, PlayerProgressionManager calls `consciousnessAwakeningManager.updateMissionTrackerUI()`
5. The mission tracker UI refreshes and shows ✅ for completed objectives

## Safety Features:

- Optional chaining (`?.`) prevents errors if ConsciousnessAwakeningManager is undefined
- Setter can be called at any time (before or after system initialization)
- Console log confirms successful connection
- All existing functionality preserved
