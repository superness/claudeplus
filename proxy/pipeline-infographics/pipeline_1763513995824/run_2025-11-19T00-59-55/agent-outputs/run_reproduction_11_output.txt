## Analysis

The reproduction script executed successfully but encountered a **framework error** that prevented complete bug reproduction:

### What Worked ✅
- Environment setup (HTTP server, Chrome cleanup)
- Script execution and WebSocket communication
- Command execution (5/6 commands successful)
- Evidence collection (console logs captured)

### What Failed ❌
- **Crafting Command**: The `startCraftingJob` command failed with "Insufficient materials"
- **Blueprint Mismatch**: The test added tritanium/pyerite/mexallon, but `basic_afterburner_bp` requires different materials
- **Test Incomplete**: Could not proceed to fitting and UI validation stages

### Root Cause
The reproduction script makes assumptions about blueprint material requirements that don't match the actual game data. The `reproduction_creator` needs to either:
1. Query actual blueprint requirements before generating tests
2. Use a known working blueprint with verified materials
3. Implement a command to discover blueprint requirements

### Evidence Quality
- Console logs: ✅ Captured (5 entries, all Chrome internal errors)
- Game logs: ⚠️ Limited due to early test failure
- Commands executed: 6 (5 successful, 1 failed)
- Status: FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
