### WebSocket Command Analysis

**Initial State (Commands 1-2):**
- Command 1 (`getMissionState`): `first_crafting` objective showing `"completed": false`, `modules_crafted: 0`, `modules_fitted: 0`
- Command 2 (`getPlayerProgression`): Statistics show `"modules_crafted": 0`, `"modules_fitted": 0`

**Crafting Phase (Commands 3-11):**
- Commands 3-8: Added required resources (tritanium, pyerite, mexallon, isogen, circuit_boards, quantum_core)
- Command 9 (`startCraftingJob`): Successfully started crafting job for `basic_afterburner_bp`
- Command 10 (`completeCraftingJob`): Force-completed job, created `basic_afterburner` item
- Command 11 (`getInventory`): Confirmed item in inventory: `{"id": "basic_afterburner", "name": "Basic Afterburner", "type": "propulsion", "quantity": 1}`
- Command 12 (`getPlayerProgression`): Statistics show `"modules_crafted": 1` ✅ (BACKEND UPDATED)

**Fitting Phase (Commands 13-15):**
- Command 13 (`dock`): Successfully docked at station
- Command 14 (`fitItem`): Successfully fitted `basic_afterburner` to mid slot 0
- Command 15 (`getFittedItems`): Confirmed item fitted in mid slot 0

**Final Verification (Commands 16-17):**
- Command 16 (`getPlayerProgression`): 
  - Statistics show `"modules_crafted": 1`, `"modules_fitted": 1` ✅ (BACKEND UPDATED)
  - Player leveled up: Level 1 → Level 2 ✅
  - Experience gained: 0 → 1300 XP ✅
  - Phase progress: `"completed": 1` out of 4 objectives ✅
  - **CRITICAL**: `first_crafting` objective showing `"completed": true` ✅
  
- Command 17 (`getMissionState`):
  - **CRITICAL**: `first_crafting` objective showing `"completed": true` ✅
  - Completed objectives count: 0 → 1 ✅

### Console Log Analysis

**Console Log Summary:**
- **Error Count**: 5 errors
- **Exception Count**: 0 exceptions
- **Error Types**: All errors are Chrome GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) registration errors, NOT game-related errors

**Console Error Details:**
1. `"DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT"` errors (3 occurrences) - Chrome internal GCM service
2. `"Authentication Failed: wrong_secret"` - Chrome internal GCM authentication
3. `"Failed to log in to GCM, resetting connection"` - Chrome internal GCM connection

**Error Correlation**: ❌ **Console errors do NOT correlate with the bug**
- All console errors are Chrome browser infrastructure errors (GCM service)
- No JavaScript errors from the game code
- No exceptions during WebSocket command execution
- No errors during crafting or fitting operations

### Bug Verification

**Expected Behavior:**
- When player crafts AND fits a module, the `first_crafting` objective should complete
- PlayerProgressionManager should track this completion
- The mission tracker UI should update to show ✅

**Actual Behavior from Evidence:**

✅ **Backend Logic Works Correctly:**
- PlayerProgressionManager correctly tracked `modules_crafted: 0 → 1`
- PlayerProgressionManager correctly tracked `modules_fitted: 0 → 1`
- Objective `completed` flag changed: `false → true`
- Player leveled up as expected (Level 1 → 2, +1300 XP)
- Phase progress updated correctly (0 → 1 completed objectives)

❓ **UI Update Status: CANNOT VERIFY**

The evidence shows the **backend state is correct**, but this test **CANNOT verify the UI layer** because:
1. WebSocket responses only show backend data (PlayerProgressionManager state)
2. No DOM inspection was performed to check the `mission-tracker-ui` div
3. No visual verification of ⬜ vs ✅ symbols
4. Test limitation acknowledged in evidence: `"This test verifies the mission objective completion logic works correctly. Manual inspection of the mission-tracker-ui div would show it displaying stale data (⬜ instead of ✅)."`

**Bug Report Claims:**
- "PlayerProgressionManager tracks 'modules_fitted' which IS working correctly" ✅ **VERIFIED BY EVIDENCE**
- "The UI just isn't reading from it or updating properly" ❓ **NOT VERIFIED** (no DOM/UI inspection in evidence)

### Decision Rationale

This is a **PARTIAL VERIFICATION**:
- ✅ Backend logic confirmed working (objective completes, stats update)
- ❓ UI layer behavior not verified (no DOM inspection)
- ❌ Console logs do not show any game-related errors
- ✅ Runtime evidence is comprehensive and proves backend works
- ❓ Cannot confirm if UI displays stale data without DOM/visual inspection

**The bug report's hypothesis cannot be fully confirmed or denied** because:
1. The test proved the backend works correctly
2. But did not capture actual UI state (DOM inspection or screenshot)
3. The bug might exist in the UI layer (ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.updateMissionTrackerUI not being called)
4. Or the bug might NOT exist (UI might actually update correctly when running in a real browser)

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

The test successfully verified that the backend logic (PlayerProgressionManager) works correctly—the objective completes, stats update, and the player levels up as expected. However, the bug report specifically claims the **UI does not update visually** (shows ⬜ instead of ✅), and this test did NOT verify the UI layer. Without DOM inspection, screenshots, or visual confirmation, I cannot conclusively confirm whether the mission tracker UI bug exists or not. The backend works, but the UI behavior remains unverified.
