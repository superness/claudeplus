Excellent! I've created a comprehensive bug reproduction script. Let me summarize what it does:

## Bug Reproduction Script Created: `test_active_mission_ui_bug_reproduction.js`

### What the Script Does

The script automatically reproduces the Active Mission UI bug through these steps:

1. **Get Initial State**: Checks player progression and mission tracker UI state
2. **Add Crafting Materials**: Gives player resources needed for `basic_afterburner_bp` blueprint
3. **Craft Module**: Starts and force-completes a crafting job (triggers `recordModuleCrafted()`)
4. **Wait for Events**: Allows time for event propagation
5. **Verify Crafting Counter**: Checks if `modules_crafted` statistic was incremented
6. **Find/Create Station**: Locates nearby station or creates test station
7. **Dock**: Docks at the station
8. **Fit Module**: Fits the crafted module to ship (triggers `recordModuleFitted()`)
9. **Wait for Events**: Allows time for event propagation
10. **Verify Fitting Counter**: Checks if `modules_fitted` statistic was incremented
11. **Check Backend State**: Verifies if objective is marked complete in `PlayerProgressionManager`
12. **Check UI State (CRITICAL)**: Uses `getMissionTrackerUI()` to inspect DOM and verify if UI shows ✅ or ⬜

### Bug Detection Logic

The script reproduces the bug when:
- **Backend**: `objective.completed = true` ✅ (PlayerProgressionManager tracks completion)
- **UI**: Objective shows ⬜ (incomplete) instead of ✅ (complete)

This proves that:
1. The tracking logic works (`recordModuleCrafted()` and `recordModuleFitted()` are called correctly)
2. The objective completion logic works (PlayerProgressionManager marks it complete)
3. **THE BUG**: `ConsciousnessAwakeningManager.updateMissionTrackerUI()` is either not called or has a bug in its logic

### Evidence Collection

The script collects comprehensive evidence including:
- Initial and final UI states
- All command responses
- Statistics counters (`modules_crafted`, `modules_fitted`)
- Objective completion status (backend vs UI)
- Chrome console logs with error counts
- Full test execution timeline

### Running the Script

```bash
node test_active_mission_ui_bug_reproduction.js
```

The script uses ChromeManager to automatically:
- Launch Chrome with correct WSL paths
- Apply cache-disable flags
- Set up WebSocket relay for test commands
- Capture console logs
- Clean up processes on completion

**DECISION: script_ready**
