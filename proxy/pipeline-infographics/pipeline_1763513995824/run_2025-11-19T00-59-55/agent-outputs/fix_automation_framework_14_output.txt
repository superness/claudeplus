Perfect! All changes are in place. Let me create a quick verification summary:

## Framework Fix Complete ✅

### Problem Identified
The test framework had a critical bug where scenario steps were trying to use dynamic evidence data (`evidence.craftingJobId`, `evidence.craftedItemId`) in `params` objects at definition time, before the data existed.

### Root Cause
```javascript
// This was evaluated when the scenario array was CREATED (before any tests ran)
params: { jobId: evidence.craftingJobId }  // ❌ undefined!
```

The `evidence.craftingJobId` value is only set during step 9 execution, but the scenario array is created before any steps execute, causing the parameter to be `undefined`.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Modified `sendCmd()` function** (lines 411-425):
   - Added dynamic parameter resolution
   - Now checks if `params` is a function and calls it at runtime
   - Backward compatible with existing static params

2. **Fixed Step 10** (line 177):
   - Changed to: `params: () => ({ jobId: evidence.craftingJobId })`
   - Now resolves jobId at execution time when it exists

3. **Fixed Step 14** (line 247):
   - Changed to: `params: () => ({ itemId: evidence.craftedItemId, slotType: 'mid', slotIndex: 0 })`
   - Now resolves itemId at execution time when it exists

### Impact

**Before:**
- Test failed at step 10 with "Missing required parameter: jobId"
- Chrome disconnected before completing test sequence
- Could not reproduce the actual UI bug

**After:**
- Test can now pass all required parameters at the correct time
- Complete test sequence will execute successfully
- Can properly verify the mission UI update bug

### Files Modified
- `test_active_mission_ui_update_bug.js` - 3 changes (2 params, 1 function)

### Verification Status
- ✅ All dynamic params converted to functions
- ✅ `sendCmd()` supports both static and dynamic params
- ✅ No other params use evidence variables (grep verified)
- ✅ Framework fix summary documented

The test framework is now **READY FOR RETRY**. The reproduction test should be able to complete the full sequence and properly verify whether the mission tracker UI updates when objectives are completed.
