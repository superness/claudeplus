## Bug Verification Analysis

### Evidence Checklist Review

❌ **1. Evidence file exists** - YES, but incomplete  
❌ **2. Contains "commands" array with WebSocket responses** - YES, but test incomplete  
❌ **3. Contains "bugReproduced": true OR "status": "BUG_REPRODUCED"** - NO, status is "COMMAND_FAILED"  
✅ **4. Console log file path present** - YES  
✅ **5. Console logs array populated** - YES (5 error entries, but unrelated to bug)  
❌ **6. Test script was EXECUTED** - YES, but failed early  
❌ **7. Runtime state snapshots captured** - PARTIAL (initial state only, no completion state)  

### Evidence Analysis

#### WebSocket Command Execution
1. **getMissionState** - ✅ SUCCESS
   - Retrieved initial mission state
   - Crafting objective "first_crafting" shows `completed: false`
   - Progress: 0/1 modules crafted, 0/1 modules fitted

2. **getPlayerProgression** - ✅ SUCCESS
   - Retrieved player statistics
   - Confirmed `modules_crafted: 0` and `modules_fitted: 0`

3. **startCraftingJob** - ❌ FAILED
   - **Error**: "Blueprint not found: basic_afterburner"
   - **Stack trace**: GameTestingInterface.startCraftingJob:932
   - **Result**: Test could not proceed to crafting → fitting → UI verification

#### Console Log Analysis
```json
{
  "consoleLogFile": "C:\\Users\\super\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ChromeTest_1763411549485\\chrome_debug.log",
  "consoleErrorCount": 5,
  "consoleExceptionCount": 0,
  "consoleErrors": [
    "Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT",
    "Error code: 401  Error message: Authentication Failed: wrong_secret",
    "Failed to log in to GCM, resetting connection.",
    "Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT",
    "Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT"
  ]
}
```

**Console Error Correlation**: All 5 console errors are Chrome GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) authentication failures - **NOT related to the mission tracker UI bug**. These are infrastructure errors from Chrome's background services, not game code errors.

#### Missing Critical Evidence

**What's Missing for BUG_CONFIRMED**:
1. ❌ No crafting completion state captured
2. ❌ No module fitting state captured
3. ❌ No mission tracker UI state after completion
4. ❌ No comparison between PlayerProgressionManager stats and UI display
5. ❌ No evidence of UI failing to update (test never reached that point)

### Test Failure Root Cause

**Test Implementation Issue**: The test script used blueprint ID `basic_afterburner`, which doesn't exist in the game's CraftingManager. This is a **test setup error**, not a framework error or bug verification.

**Why This Matters**: The test failed during **setup phase** (trying to trigger the bug), not during **verification phase** (observing the bug). We have NO runtime evidence of whether the mission tracker UI actually fails to update.

### Verification Decision

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "Test failed early due to invalid blueprint ID ('basic_afterburner' not found). The test never reached the critical verification point where we would observe whether the mission tracker UI updates after objective completion. While we have initial state snapshots proving the game systems are running, we have ZERO evidence of the actual bug behavior (UI not updating after crafting + fitting).",

    "consoleLogsPresent": true,
    "consoleLogFile": "C:\\Users\\super\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ChromeTest_1763411549485\\chrome_debug.log",
    "consoleErrorCount": 5,

    "websocketResponses": "Command 1-2: SUCCESS (initial state retrieved), Command 3: FAILED (blueprint not found)",
    "consoleErrors": [

      "Error code: 401  Error message: Authentication Failed: wrong_secret",
      "Failed to log in to GCM, resetting connection."
    ],
    "errorCorrelation": "Console errors are Chrome GCM authentication failures, NOT related to mission tracker UI bug",
    "stateInconsistency": "UNABLE TO VERIFY - test failed before crafting/fitting could occur",
    "matchesBugReport": false,
    "testProgressPercentage": "33% (2/6 steps completed before failure)"
  },
  "consoleLogInsights": [
    "Console logs contain only Chrome infrastructure errors (GCM authentication)",
    "No JavaScript exceptions or errors from game code",
    "No evidence of mission tracker UI rendering or update attempts",
    "Test environment is functional but test data setup is incorrect"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Fix test script to use valid blueprint ID (check CraftingManager.js for available blueprints)",
    "Alternative: Use direct progression injection (recordModuleCrafted + recordModuleFitted) instead of startCraftingJob",
    "Re-run test with corrected blueprint ID to capture full crafting → fitting → UI verification sequence",
    "Verify mission tracker UI state BEFORE and AFTER objective completion"
  ],
  "criticalIssue": "Test failed during SETUP phase (invalid blueprint), not during VERIFICATION phase. We have no evidence of whether the bug exists because we never triggered the objective completion that would expose the UI update failure."
}
```

### Why This Is INCONCLUSIVE (Not BUG_CONFIRMED)

**Missing Evidence Checklist**:
- ✅ Evidence file exists - YES
- ✅ Runtime data from game - YES (initial state)
- ❌ **Bug behavior observed** - **NO** (test failed before bug could manifest)
- ❌ **Complete test execution** - NO (33% complete)
- ❌ **UI state comparison** - NO (never reached UI verification)
- ❌ **Console errors related to bug** - NO (only Chrome GCM errors)

**Critical Rule Violation**: "No runtime evidence = INCONCLUSIVE"

We have runtime evidence that the **game is running**, but we have **ZERO runtime evidence of the bug behavior** because the test failed before:
1. Crafting a module
2. Fitting the module
3. Observing whether the UI updated

**This is like starting a car engine test and the fuel pump fails - we know the car exists, but we have NO evidence about whether the engine works.**

---

## DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE

**Reason**: Test execution failed early due to invalid blueprint ID. No runtime evidence captured of the reported bug behavior (mission tracker UI failing to update after objective completion). Console logs contain only Chrome infrastructure errors unrelated to the mission tracker system. Must fix test setup and re-run to obtain conclusive verification.
