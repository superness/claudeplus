Perfect! I have all the data needed. Let me create the final execution report in JSON format.

## Analysis

**What happened:**

The reproduction script executed successfully and completed 2 out of 7 planned test steps:

1. ✅ **Step 1**: Retrieved initial mission state - found the "Ship Enhancement" objective (uncompleted)
2. ✅ **Step 2**: Retrieved player progression statistics - confirmed `modules_crafted: 0`, `modules_fitted: 0`
3. ❌ **Step 3**: Attempted to start crafting a basic afterburner module - **FAILED with "Insufficient materials"**

The test could not proceed beyond step 3 because the script didn't provide the player with crafting materials before attempting to craft.

**Framework Error Details:**

- **Issue**: Reproduction script incomplete - missing resource provisioning
- **Root Cause**: The `reproduction_creator` agent created a test that assumes the player has materials, but never gave them any
- **Required Fix**: Insert a `giveResources` command before `startCraftingJob` to provide materials needed for crafting
- **Impact**: Cannot reproduce the reported UI bug because the test prerequisites are not met

**Evidence Quality:**

The evidence file is well-formed and contains:
- ✅ Console log file path
- ✅ Console logs array (5 entries)
- ✅ All executed commands with responses
- ✅ Initial mission state and progression data
- ✅ Error details from failed command

**Note**: The console errors about "DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT" and "Authentication Failed" are Chrome's GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) deprecation warnings - these are browser-level messages unrelated to the game's functionality.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
