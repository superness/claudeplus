Perfect! Now the script is complete. However, I realize there's a fundamental issue: **The script can verify the backend logic works, but cannot verify the UI actually updates** because there's no `getMissionTrackerUI` command to inspect the DOM.

This is actually a case where I should recommend implementing the command. Let me output my analysis:

---

## Analysis

I've created a comprehensive bug reproduction script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_active_mission_ui_update_bug_v2.js`. 

### What the Script Does:
1. ✅ Checks initial mission state (first_crafting objective)
2. ✅ Adds crafting materials (tritanium, pyerite, etc.)
3. ✅ Starts crafting job for basic_afterburner
4. ✅ Force-completes crafting job (test mode)
5. ✅ Creates test station and docks
6. ✅ Fits the crafted module to ship
7. ✅ Checks if objective is marked as complete in backend (PlayerProgressionManager)

### Critical Limitation:
The script **cannot verify if the UI actually updates** because there's no command to inspect the DOM. The available commands can check:
- ✅ Backend objective.completed flag (via getMissionState)
- ✅ Player progression stats (via getPlayerProgression)
- ❌ **Mission tracker UI HTML/state** (no command exists)

### Two Possible Outcomes:

**Outcome 1: Backend Bug** (objective.completed stays false)
- Script returns `false` and saves evidence as `BUG_REPRODUCED_BACKEND`
- This means the objective completion logic itself is broken

**Outcome 2: UI Bug** (objective.completed = true, but UI doesn't update)
- Script returns `true` but notes `CANNOT_VERIFY_UI_STATE`
- Backend works correctly, but we can't verify if the UI shows ✅ or ⬜
- **This is the actual bug** according to the bug report

### Recommendation:

To properly reproduce this bug, we need a new command in GameTestingInterface:

```javascript
/**
 * Get mission tracker UI state by inspecting the DOM
 * @param {Object} params - {}
 * @returns {Object} {visible: boolean, missions: [{id, objectives: [{text, completed}]}]}
 */
getMissionTrackerUI(params = {}) {
    const trackerElement = document.getElementById('mission-tracker-ui');
    
    if (!trackerElement) {
        return {
            visible: false,
            html: null,
            missions: []
        };
    }

    // Parse the HTML to extract objective states
    const missions = [];
    const missionElements = trackerElement.querySelectorAll('.mission-objective');
    
    missionElements.forEach(elem => {
        const text = elem.textContent;
        const isCompleted = text.includes('✅');
        const isIncomplete = text.includes('⬜');
        
        missions.push({
            text: text.trim(),
            completed: isCompleted,
            incomplete: isIncomplete
        });
    });

    return {
        visible: true,
        html: trackerElement.innerHTML,
        missions: missions,
        objectiveCount: missions.length,
        completedCount: missions.filter(m => m.completed).length
    };
}
```

**DECISION: need_command_implementation**

The bug reproduction requires inspecting the DOM to verify the UI state. The command `getMissionTrackerUI` needs to be implemented in GameTestingInterface.js before this bug can be fully automated.
