Excellent! Let me create a final verification summary:

## Test Automation Framework Fix Complete

I've successfully fixed the test automation framework issue that was preventing the bug reproduction test from running correctly.

### Problem Summary

The test script `test_active_mission_ui_update_bug.js` was failing at step 3 because it attempted to start a crafting job without first providing the player with required materials. The error was:
```
Insufficient materials
```

### Fix Applied

Added 3 new test steps to provision crafting materials **before** attempting to craft:

1. **Step 3**: Give 1000 tritanium (using `addResource` command)
2. **Step 4**: Give 500 pyerite (using `addResource` command)  
3. **Step 5**: Give 100 mexallon (using `addResource` command)
4. **Step 6**: Start crafting job (original step 3, now has materials)

All subsequent steps were renumbered from 4-11 → 7-14.

### Changes Made

✅ **File**: `test_active_mission_ui_update_bug.js`
- Added 3 material provisioning steps using `addResource` command
- Renumbered all subsequent test steps
- Updated documentation header with correct reproduction steps

✅ **File**: `AUTOMATION_FRAMEWORK_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (created)
- Complete documentation of the fix
- Materials requirements from game code
- Expected test execution flow

✅ **Validation**
- JavaScript syntax check: **PASSED**
- Materials verified from `js/systems/ContentManager.js`
- `addResource` command verified in `js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js`

### Test Ready for Retry

The test framework is now fully functional and ready to execute. The test should now:
- Successfully complete all prerequisite steps
- Reach the actual bug reproduction point (step 14)
- Verify that the mission tracker UI fails to update when objectives are completed
