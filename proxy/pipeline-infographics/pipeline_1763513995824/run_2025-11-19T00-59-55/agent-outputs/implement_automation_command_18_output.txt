Perfect! Now let me create the output JSON to document what was implemented:

```json
{
  "commandName": "getMissionTrackerUI",
  "implementation": "Added DOM inspection command to retrieve mission tracker UI state, including objective text, completion markers (✅/⬜), and visibility status",
  "filesModified": ["/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js"],
  "registrationAdded": "this.commandHandlers.set('getMissionTrackerUI', this.getMissionTrackerUI.bind(this));",
  "methodAdded": true,
  "tested": false,
  "features": {
    "detectsVisibility": "Checks if mission tracker element is visible using computed styles",
    "parsesObjectives": "Extracts objectives from both text content and structured DOM elements",
    "detectsCompletionState": "Identifies completed (✅) vs incomplete (⬜) objectives",
    "supportsMultipleFormats": "Works with both plain text checkboxes and structured .mission-objective elements",
    "providesMetrics": "Returns counts for total, completed, and incomplete objectives"
  },
  "responseFormat": {
    "visible": "boolean - whether UI is visible",
    "exists": "boolean - whether DOM element exists",
    "html": "string - inner HTML of tracker element",
    "innerText": "string - text content of tracker element",
    "objectives": "Array - parsed objectives with {text, completed, incomplete, rawLine}",
    "objectiveCount": "number - total objectives found",
    "completedCount": "number - objectives marked complete",
    "incompleteCount": "number - objectives marked incomplete"
  },
  "notes": "Command inspects DOM element 'mission-tracker-ui' and parses objective completion state from both text markers (✅/⬜) and CSS classes. Supports both plain text format and structured elements with .mission-objective class or [data-objective-id] attribute. This enables bug reproduction scripts to verify that UI updates correctly when objectives are completed."
}
```
