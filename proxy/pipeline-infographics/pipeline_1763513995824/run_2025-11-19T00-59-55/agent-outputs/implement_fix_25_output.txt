Excellent! Now let me create a summary document of the fix:

  "fixSummary": "Fixed Active Mission UI tracker to properly detect and display completed objectives",
  "expectedImpact": "Mission tracker UI will now:\n1. Appear on game startup showing current progression phase objectives\n2. Update in real-time when objectives are completed\n3. Show ✅ for completed objectives instead of always showing ⬜\n4. Preserve completion status when missions are created/refreshed",
  "riskAssessment": "Low risk:\n- Changes are minimal and focused on UI integration\n- No modifications to core game mechanics or data structures\n- PlayerProgressionManager tracking was already working correctly\n- Only added missing UI initialization and synchronization",
  "rootCauseSummary": "The bug had two parts:\n1. Missing initialization: ConsciousnessAwakeningManager was connected to PlayerProgressionManager, but no mission was created at startup, so the UI never appeared\n2. Incomplete synchronization: When objectives were completed in PlayerProgressionManager, the mission tracker UI was refreshed but the underlying mission data in ConsciousnessAwakeningManager was never updated, so it continued showing stale ⬜ status\n\nThe fix initializes the mission tracker at startup and ensures objective completion properly syncs to the ConsciousnessAwakeningManager's stored mission data before refreshing the UI.",
  "additionalNotes": "The ConsciousnessAwakeningManager was already being initialized in index.html (lines 2498-2511) and the connection to PlayerProgressionManager was already established. The missing pieces were:\n1. Creating the initial mission from current phase objectives\n2. Calling updateMissionProgress() to sync objective completion status\n\nNo changes needed to data models or event systems - just UI initialization and synchronization."

**DECISION: fix_implemented**
