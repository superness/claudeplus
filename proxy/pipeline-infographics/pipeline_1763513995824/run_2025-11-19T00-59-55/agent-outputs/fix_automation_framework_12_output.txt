Perfect! Let me create a summary document of the framework fix:

## Framework Fix Summary

I've successfully identified and fixed the test infrastructure issues that prevented the Active Mission UI bug from being reproduced. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

### Issues Identified

**Issue 1: Insufficient Materials for Blueprint**
- The test script attempted to craft `basic_afterburner_bp` with insufficient materials
- Test provided: tritanium(1000), pyerite(500), mexallon(100)
- Actual requirements: tritanium(3000), pyerite(1500), mexallon(400), isogen(150), circuit_boards(5), quantum_core(1)
- This caused the `startCraftingJob` command to fail with "Insufficient materials"

**Issue 2: Incorrect Slot Type**
- The test tried to fit an afterburner to a `high` slot
- Afterburners are propulsion modules that use `mid` slots (per ContentManager.js:84)

### Fixes Applied

**Fix 1: Updated Material Amounts (lines 91-156)**
Added all required materials with correct quantities:
- tritanium: 1000 → 3000
- pyerite: 500 → 1500  
- mexallon: 100 → 400
- Added isogen: 150
- Added circuit_boards: 5
- Added quantum_core: 1

**Fix 2: Corrected Slot Type (line 246)**
- Changed `slotType: 'high'` → `slotType: 'mid'`
- Updated verification to check `r.mid` instead of `r.high` (line 265)

**Fix 3: Updated Documentation**
- Updated header comment to reflect correct materials (lines 15-16)
- Updated step descriptions to reference correct blueprint requirements
- Renumbered all test steps (now Steps 1-17 instead of 1-14)

### Files Modified

- `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_active_mission_ui_update_bug.js`

### Root Cause Analysis

The reproduction script generator did not query the actual blueprint definitions from ContentManager before generating test scripts. It made incorrect assumptions about:
1. Material requirements (assumed lower amounts)
2. Required material types (missed isogen, circuit_boards, quantum_core)
3. Module fitting slots (assumed high instead of mid)

### Recommendation for Future Tests

Test script generators should:
1. Query ContentManager.getBlueprint(blueprintId) to get actual material requirements
2. Query ContentManager.getItem(itemId) to get correct fitting slot information
3. Use actual game data instead of assumptions about resource amounts and requirements

The test script should now successfully execute and reproduce the Active Mission UI bug (where the mission tracker UI doesn't update when objectives are completed).
