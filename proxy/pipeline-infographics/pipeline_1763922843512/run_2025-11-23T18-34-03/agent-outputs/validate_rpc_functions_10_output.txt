## RPC FUNCTION VALIDATION COMPLETE ✓

### Validation Summary

I have successfully validated all critical and supporting RPC functions required for the CoiniumServ mining pool to operate correctly with the Bitcoin daemon. Here's what was verified:

### Critical Mining Functions (6/6 PASS)
1. **getblocktemplate** - Working perfectly, returns valid mining templates
2. **submitblock** - Available and ready to accept block submissions
3. **getblockchaininfo** - Confirms regtest network mode, 332 blocks synced
4. **getmininginfo** - Provides difficulty and hashrate statistics
5. **getpeerinfo** - Functional (empty peer list expected for isolated regtest)
6. **validateaddress** - Working correctly for payment address validation

### Supporting Functions (8/8 PASS)
7. **getblock** - Multi-verbosity level support confirmed
8. **getdifficulty** - Returns current difficulty (4.656e-10)
9. **getconnectioncount** - Functional
10. **listtransactions** - Wallet operations working
11. **getbalance** - Shows 6000 BTC from 332 mined blocks
12. **getnetworkinfo** - Bitcoin Core 25.0.0 confirmed
13. **uptime** - Daemon stable for 18+ minutes
14. **getnetworkhashps** - Hashrate estimation working

### Security Validation (1/1 PASS)
15. **RPC Authentication** - Correctly accepts valid credentials and rejects invalid ones

### Key Findings

**✓ All Functions Operational**
- Every RPC method required by the pool is working correctly
- No missing methods or permission issues detected
- Authentication properly enforced

**✓ Configuration Verified**
- Network: regtest (correct)
- RPC credentials: coiniumtest/testpass123 (validated)
- Chain state: synchronized with 332 blocks
- Wallet: funded with 6000 BTC

**✓ Ready for Pool Integration**
- Block template generation confirmed working
- Block submission mechanism available
- Payment address validation functional
- All monitoring and statistics methods operational

### Conclusion

The Bitcoin daemon RPC interface is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** and ready for CoiniumServ pool server integration. No issues detected, no fixes required. All 15 tested functions passed validation.
