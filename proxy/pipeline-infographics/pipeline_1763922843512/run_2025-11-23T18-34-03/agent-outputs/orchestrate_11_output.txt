Perfect! I can now see the infrastructure state clearly:

## Current Infrastructure State Analysis

**Dependencies**: ✓ All installed
- bitcoind: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind`
- mono: `/usr/bin/mono`
- cpuminer: `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer`

**Daemon Status**: ⚠️ Running but with RPC authentication issues
- Process running (PID 2499)
- RPC port 18443 listening
- **CRITICAL**: Multiple "incorrect password attempt" errors in logs
- Config shows: `rpcuser=coiniumtest`, `rpcpassword=testpass123`

**Pool Status**: ✗ Not running
- Pool config exists and points to daemon at `172.22.45.9:18443`
- Pool config has matching credentials: `username: coiniumtest`, `password: testpass123`
- Stratum port 3333 not listening (pool not started)

**Configuration**: ✓ Exists but needs validation
- Daemon config: Present
- Pool config: Present with correct daemon connection details

## Strategic Decision

Since this is the **enhanced intelligent pipeline** with function validation and fixer agents, I should follow the proactive validation approach:

1. **Dependencies**: Already verified as installed
2. **Configs**: Exist, but RPC authentication failures suggest potential misalignment
3. **Daemon**: Running but showing RPC auth failures - this needs **function validation**
4. **Next Step**: Before proceeding with pool setup, I must validate that daemon RPC functions are working correctly

The RPC authentication failures indicate the daemon's RPC interface may not be functioning correctly for pool connections. This is exactly what the new `validate_rpc_function` agent should verify before operations proceed.

## DECISION REASONING

**Current State**:
- Dependencies: Installed ✓
- Configs: Present ✓
- Daemon: Running but RPC auth failures detected ⚠️
- Pool: Not running ✗

**Gap Identified**: 
Daemon RPC authentication is failing (recent incorrect password attempts in logs). Before starting the pool or proceeding with setup, I must validate that the daemon's RPC functions are operational and properly authenticated.

**Why validate_rpc_function**:
- Daemon is running but showing authentication errors
- Pool depends on working RPC connection to daemon
- The new enhanced pipeline includes proactive function validation
- RPC validation should verify authentication, connectivity, and basic commands (getblockcount, getblocktemplate) before pool attempts to connect
- If validation fails, the fixer agent can correct authentication issues automatically

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- Daemon process is running
- RPC port is listening
- Configs exist (credentials appear correct in both configs)

**Next Action**: Proactively validate daemon RPC functions to ensure authentication and connectivity work before pool setup attempts.

DECISION: validate_rpc_function
