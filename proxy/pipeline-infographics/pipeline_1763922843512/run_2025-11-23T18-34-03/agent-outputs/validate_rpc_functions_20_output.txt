## RPC Function Validation Report

### ✓ VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL

All critical RPC functions have been validated and are working correctly.

---

### 1. Authentication Validation ✓

**Status**: PASSED  
**Credentials**: `coiniumtest / testpass123`

- ✓ Authentication successful from localhost (127.0.0.1:18443)
- ✓ Authentication successful from network interface (172.22.45.9:18443)
- ✓ No current authentication failures during testing

**Historical Authentication Issues**: 
- Previous authentication failures detected in logs (last: 19:14:24)
- These appear to be from earlier testing/attempts with incorrect credentials
- Current configuration credentials work correctly

---

### 2. Core RPC Methods Testing ✓

**Critical Methods for Pool Operation:**

| Method | Status | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `getblockchaininfo` | ✓ PASS | Returns chain info (regtest, 332 blocks) |
| `getblocktemplate` | ✓ PASS | Returns valid block template with segwit support |
| `getmininginfo` | ✓ PASS | Returns mining statistics (0.000587 Th/s network) |
| `getpeerinfo` | ✓ PASS | Returns peer list (currently empty - regtest) |
| `submitblock` | ✓ PASS | Method available (expects hex data parameter) |
| `getinfo` | ✗ DEPRECATED | Method not found (removed in Bitcoin Core 0.16+) |

**Note**: `getinfo` is deprecated but not required for pool operation. All critical methods are functional.

### 3. Block Template Validation ✓

**Block Template Details:**
- Version: 805306368
- Capabilities: proposal
- Rules: csv, !segwit, taproot
- Target difficulty: 4.66e-10
- Coinbase value: 12.5 BTC (1,250,000,000 satoshis)
- Previous block: 410e9e80cebf...
- Long poll supported: Yes
- Transactions in mempool: 0

**Assessment**: Block template is valid and ready for mining work distribution.

---

### 4. Network Interface Accessibility ✓

**Both interfaces responding correctly:**
- Localhost (127.0.0.1:18443): ✓ Accessible
- Network interface (172.22.45.9:18443): ✓ Accessible
- Chain verification: Both return "regtest" ✓

---

### 5. Wallet Validation ✓

**Wallet Status:**
- Wallet name: "mining"
- Format: SQLite (Bitcoin Core 23.0+)
- Balance: 6,000 BTC
- Transaction count: 221
- Descriptors: Enabled
- HD wallet: Yes

**Pool Wallet Address Validation:**
- Configured address: `bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7`
- Validation: ✓ Valid regtest address
- Type: Native SegWit (bech32)
- Witness version: 0

**Note**: The pool wallet address is valid but not currently in the daemon's wallet. This is acceptable as the pool can use this as a payout address without it being in the daemon wallet.

---

### 6. Configuration Consistency Check ✓

**Pool Configuration (`default.json`):**
```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "host": "172.22.45.9",
    "port": 18443,
    "username": "coiniumtest",
    "password": "testpass123"
  },
  "wallet": {
    "address": "bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7"
  }
}
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✓ Daemon host/port accessible
- ✓ Credentials work correctly
- ✓ Wallet address is valid regtest format
- ✓ Network mode: regtest (consistent across configs)

---

### Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL RPC FUNCTIONS VALID

**Key Findings:**
1. RPC authentication is working correctly with configured credentials
2. All critical mining RPC methods are functional
3. Block templates are being generated properly
4. Network accessibility confirmed on both interfaces
5. Wallet is funded and operational
6. No active authentication issues (historical failures were from previous attempts)

**Ready for Next Stage:**
The daemon RPC functions are fully validated and ready for pool connection. The pool can now be safely started and should be able to:
- Connect to the daemon successfully
- Retrieve block templates
- Submit found blocks
- Monitor mining activity

**Recommendation**: Proceed with pool startup (`start_pool` stage).
