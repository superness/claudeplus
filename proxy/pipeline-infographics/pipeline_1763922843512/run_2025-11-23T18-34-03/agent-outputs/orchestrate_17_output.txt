## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

**Current State Assessment:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✅ All installed
   - bitcoind: present
   - mono: present  
   - cpuminer: present

2. **Configurations**: ✅ Both exist
   - Daemon config: `/home/super/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (RPC: coiniumtest/testpass123)
   - Pool config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json`

3. **Daemon Status**: ⚠️ **RUNNING but RPC authentication failing**
   - Processes detected: PIDs 2499, 11547 (daemon running)
   - RPC Error: "Authorization failed: Incorrect rpcuser or rpcpassword"
   - Issue: Using wrong credentials (pooltest/pass123) vs actual (coiniumtest/testpass123)

4. **Pool Status**: ❌ Not running
   - No CoiniumServ process detected
   - No Stratum ports listening (3333, 13333)

5. **Mining Ports**: ❌ None listening
   - RPC port 18443: not accessible (auth issue)
   - Stratum ports: not listening (pool not running)

**Critical Issue Identified**: 
The daemon is running but RPC function validation will fail due to authentication mismatch. The enhanced pipeline should catch this during proactive validation.

**Gap Analysis**:
- Daemon RPC functions need validation (will detect auth failure)
- Pool not running (depends on working daemon RPC)
- Miner not configured

**Enhanced Pipeline Strategy**:
With the new function validation capabilities, the intelligent approach is:

1. First, validate daemon RPC functions proactively
2. This will detect the authentication issue
3. Route to fix_rpc_function to resolve credentials
4. Re-validate daemon functions
5. Then proceed to pool setup with validated daemon
6. Validate pool functions before operations
7. Continue with miner setup and full validation

This proactive validate → fix → re-validate approach prevents cascading failures and ensures each component is fully functional before the next depends on it.

REASONING:
Daemon is running (PIDs 2499, 11547) but RPC authentication is failing. Before proceeding with any infrastructure setup, the enhanced pipeline requires proactive validation of daemon RPC functions. This will detect the credential mismatch and allow the fixer agent to resolve it automatically. The new intelligent routing ensures we validate RPC connectivity and authentication BEFORE attempting pool setup, preventing wasted effort and cascading failures.

Dependencies and configs exist, but daemon RPC functions must be validated first to ensure the foundation is solid. Starting with function validation rather than jumping to setup operations.

DECISION: validate_rpc_function
