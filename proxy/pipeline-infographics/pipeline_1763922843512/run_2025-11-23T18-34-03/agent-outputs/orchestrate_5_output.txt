## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

✅ **Daemon Status:**
- Process: RUNNING
- Configuration: EXISTS
- RPC Port: Accessible (bitcoin-cli commands working)
- Blockchain: 332 blocks in regtest
- Wallet: "mining" wallet with 6000 BTC balance
- Wallet funded: YES (sufficient balance for operations)

❌ **Pool Status:**
- Process: NOT RUNNING
- Configuration: EXISTS
- Stratum Port: NOT LISTENING (neither 3333 nor 13333)

❓ **Ports Status:**
- Port 18443 (RPC): Not showing in netstat but RPC working (likely listening on localhost)
- Port 3333/13333 (Stratum): Not listening (pool not running)

📋 **Dependencies & Configs:**
- Daemon config: ✓ EXISTS
- Pool config: ✓ EXISTS
- Software: Appears installed (daemon running, configs present)

## Strategic Decision

With the **enhanced pipeline featuring proactive function validation**, the intelligent approach is:

**Infrastructure State**: Daemon running with RPC accessible, but we haven't validated ALL critical RPC functions yet (getblocktemplate, submitblock, etc.) which are essential for pool operations.

**Next Action**: Before proceeding to pool setup, we should proactively validate daemon RPC functions to ensure all critical APIs needed by the pool are working correctly. This prevents downstream failures and follows the new validate → fix → re-validate pattern.

**Why validate_daemon_function instead of delegate_pool_setup?**
1. **Proactive validation philosophy**: The enhanced pipeline emphasizes validating functions BEFORE operations
2. **Daemon is foundation**: Pool depends on multiple daemon RPC calls (getblocktemplate, submitblock, getblockchaininfo, etc.)
3. **Prevent cascading failures**: If daemon RPC has issues, pool will fail anyway - better to catch and fix early
4. **Basic RPC works**: We confirmed getblockchaininfo and getwalletinfo work, but haven't tested mining-specific functions
5. **New intelligent routing**: With specialized validators and fixers, we should leverage them for proactive health checks

This follows the enhanced pipeline's philosophy: validate functions proactively, fix issues before they cause operational failures, then proceed confidently to the next component.
