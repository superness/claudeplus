Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Let me create a comprehensive state analysis:

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

**Current State Discovered:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✓ Installed (bitcoind, mono, cpuminer all present)

2. **Daemon Status**:
   - Process: ✓ RUNNING (PIDs 2499, 14273)
   - Config: ✓ EXISTS (~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)
   - RPC Credentials: ✗ **AUTHENTICATION FAILURE DETECTED**
     - Config has: rpcuser=coiniumtest, rpcpassword=testpass123
     - Multiple failed auth attempts logged (127.0.0.1 and 172.22.45.9)
     - RPC port 18443 should be listening but not verified
   - Functional Status: **DEGRADED** - running but RPC not accessible

3. **Pool Status**:
   - Process: ✗ NOT RUNNING
   - Config: ✓ EXISTS (build/bin/Debug/config/config.json)
   - Port 3333: Not listening
   - Status: **DOWN**

4. **Miner Status**:
   - Not assessed yet
   - Status: **UNKNOWN**

5. **Critical Issues Identified**:
   - **RPC Authentication Failure**: Daemon logs show repeated "incorrect password attempt" errors
   - **Pool Not Running**: Depends on working RPC connection to daemon
   - **No Ports Listening**: Neither 18443 (RPC) nor 3333 (Stratum) visible in netstat

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The daemon is running but RPC authentication is failing. This is a **function validation failure** - the daemon process exists but its RPC interface is not functional. This will block pool startup since the pool cannot communicate with the daemon.

**Enhanced Pipeline Strategy**:
With the new function validation and fixer agents, the intelligent approach is:

1. **Validate RPC Function First** → This will detect the authentication issue
2. **Fix RPC Authentication** → Fixer agent can correct credentials or config
3. **Re-validate RPC** → Confirm fix worked
4. **Then Proceed to Pool Setup** → Only after RPC is functional

This is the core value of the enhanced pipeline: proactive validation catches issues BEFORE attempting operations, and specialized fixers resolve them automatically.

DECISION: validate_rpc_function

REASONING:
Initial state assessment reveals a critical RPC authentication failure that must be resolved before any component operations:

**Current Infrastructure State:**
- Dependencies: Installed ✓
- Daemon: Running but RPC authentication failing ✗
- Pool: Not running (depends on working RPC) ✗
- Miner: Not yet assessed ✗

**Critical Issue Detected:**
Daemon logs show repeated "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt" errors. The daemon process is alive (PIDs 2499, 14273) but RPC functionality is broken due to authentication failure. This is exactly the type of issue the new function validation agents are designed to catch proactively.

**Why Validate RPC Function First:**
1. RPC is the foundation - pool and miner both depend on it
2. No point setting up pool if it can't communicate with daemon
3. New validation agent can test actual RPC calls (getblockchaininfo, getblocktemplate)
4. If validation fails, fixer agent can automatically correct credentials
5. Prevents cascading failures downstream

**Enhanced Pipeline Approach:**
validate_rpc_function → (if fails) → fix_rpc_function → re-validate_rpc_function → (once working) → proceed to pool setup

This proactive validation-first strategy is the core improvement of the enhanced pipeline.
