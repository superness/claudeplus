## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

1. **Daemon Status**: ✓ RUNNING (2 processes: PIDs 2499, 12883)
   - RPC accessible and responding
   - Blockchain: 332 blocks on regtest
   - Wallet funded with transactions
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED**: Multiple "incorrect password attempt" errors in logs from both 127.0.0.1 and 172.22.45.9

2. **Configuration Analysis**:
   - Daemon RPC credentials: `coiniumtest / testpass123`
   - Pool daemon connection: `coiniumtest / testpass123` to `172.22.45.9:18443`
   - Configurations match ✓

3. **Pool Status**: ✗ NOT RUNNING
   - No CoiniumServ process detected
   - Stratum port 3333 not listening
   - Pool config exists and looks valid

4. **Critical Observation**: 
   - Recent RPC authentication failures (last one at 19:14:24)
   - This suggests something (likely a previous pool attempt) is using WRONG credentials
   - The pool config has CORRECT credentials, but the daemon is rejecting connections

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The daemon logs show "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt" errors. This indicates:
- Either the pool was running with wrong credentials and crashed
- Or there's an RPC authentication mismatch that needs validation
- The configurations LOOK correct, but there may be a runtime authentication issue

**Strategy Decision:**

Before attempting to start the pool, I need to:
1. **FIRST**: Validate that RPC authentication is working correctly with the configured credentials
2. This is EXACTLY what the new `validate_rpc_function` agent is designed for
3. If validation fails, route to `fix_rpc_function` to resolve authentication issues
4. Only after RPC validation passes should we attempt pool setup

This follows the new enhanced pipeline philosophy: **validate → fix → re-validate → proceed**

## DECISION

REASONING:
Enhanced intelligent pipeline initialization for fresh infrastructure setup with function validation.

Current Infrastructure State:
- Dependencies: Likely installed (daemon running, configs exist)
- Configs: Present and appear valid
- Daemon: RUNNING (332 blocks, wallet funded)
- **CRITICAL**: Recent RPC authentication failures detected in daemon logs
- Pool: NOT RUNNING
- Miner: Not configured

Root Cause Identified:
- Daemon logs show "incorrect password attempt" errors from both localhost and 172.22.45.9
- Pool config has correct credentials (coiniumtest/testpass123)
- But runtime RPC authentication may be failing

Next Action - Proactive Function Validation:
With the enhanced pipeline, I should validate RPC authentication BEFORE attempting pool setup. The recent authentication failures suggest the RPC function may not be working correctly despite correct-looking configurations.

The new `validate_rpc_function` agent will:
1. Test RPC connectivity with configured credentials
2. Verify authentication works from both localhost and network interfaces
3. Check if getblocktemplate and other required RPC methods are accessible
4. Identify any authentication mismatches

If validation fails, the orchestrator can then route to `fix_rpc_function` for automatic remediation before proceeding to pool setup.

This proactive validation approach prevents the pool from failing at startup due to RPC issues.

DECISION: validate_rpc_function
