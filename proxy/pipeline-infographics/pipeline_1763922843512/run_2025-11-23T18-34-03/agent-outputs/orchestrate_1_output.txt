## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Detected**:
- ✓ **Dependencies**: All core dependencies installed (bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, mono, cpuminer)
- ✓ **Daemon**: Process running (PID 1749) with regtest configuration
- ✓ **Configs**: Both daemon config (~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf) and pool config exist
- ✗ **Pool**: Not running (CoiniumServ process not detected)
- ✗ **Ports**: No mining ports listening (18443 RPC, 3333/13333 Stratum)
- ✗ **Miner**: Not configured/running

**Infrastructure Gap Analysis**:
The daemon appears to be running, but no ports are listening, which suggests the daemon may not be fully functional or may have issues. With the enhanced pipeline including proactive function validation, the correct approach is to validate the daemon's RPC functions BEFORE attempting to proceed with pool setup.

**Enhanced Pipeline Strategy**:
Since we have a daemon process running but no confirmation of functional RPC, the new intelligent approach is:

1. **Validate daemon RPC functions first** (validate_daemon_function)
   - Test RPC connectivity on port 18443
   - Verify RPC authentication working
   - Check core RPC commands (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)
   - Verify wallet functions (getwalletinfo, getbalance)
   - Test getblocktemplate (critical for pool operation)

2. If validation fails → Route to **fix_daemon_function** agent
3. If validation passes → Proceed to **delegate_pool_setup**
4. After pool setup → **validate_pool_function** before considering complete

This proactive validation approach prevents cascading failures and enables targeted fixes before operations.

**DECISION: validate_daemon_function**

**REASONING**:
Enhanced pipeline with proactive function validation detected daemon process running (PID 1749) but no ports listening. Before proceeding with pool setup, must validate daemon RPC functions to ensure:

1. RPC port 18443 is accessible and responding
2. RPC authentication (rpcuser/rpcpassword) is working correctly
3. Core blockchain RPC functions operational (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)
4. Wallet RPC functions operational (critical for mining payouts)
5. getblocktemplate function working (critical for pool to request mining work)

Traditional pipeline would blindly proceed to pool setup and fail. Enhanced pipeline validates daemon functions first, enabling:
- Early detection of RPC issues (authentication, port binding, function failures)
- Targeted fixes by specialized daemon fixer agent if validation fails
- Confident progression to pool setup only after daemon proven functional

Dependencies satisfied:
- Daemon process exists (PID 1749)
- Daemon config exists
- Dependencies installed

Next step: Proactive daemon function validation to verify operational readiness before pool integration.

DECISION: validate_daemon_function
