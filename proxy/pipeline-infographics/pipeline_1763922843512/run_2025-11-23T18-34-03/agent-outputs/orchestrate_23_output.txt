Excellent! I now have complete visibility into the infrastructure state.

## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Discovered:**
- **Dependencies**: Present (bitcoind installed and functional)
- **Configs**: Exist (bitcoin.conf and pool config.json present)
- **Daemon**: RUNNING (PIDs 2499, 16201 - bitcoind in regtest mode)
  - RPC: ACCESSIBLE (successfully queried blockchain info)
  - Block height: 332
  - Wallet: Likely funded (221 transactions in wallet)
- **Pool**: NOT RUNNING (CoiniumServ process not detected)
- **Miner**: Status unknown (need to check after pool is operational)

**Ports Status:**
- RPC port 18443: Not showing in netstat (but RPC works - may be localhost-only binding)
- Stratum ports (3333/13333): Not in use (pool not running)

## Enhanced Pipeline Decision with Proactive Validation

Since the daemon is already running and RPC is accessible, I should now **proactively validate daemon functions** before proceeding to pool setup. This is the enhanced intelligence of the new pipeline:

**Instead of blindly starting the pool**, I will first:
1. Validate daemon RPC functions comprehensively (getblocktemplate, wallet functions, mining functions)
2. If validation passes → proceed to pool setup
3. If validation fails → route to daemon fixer agent → re-validate → then proceed

This proactive validation approach prevents cascading failures and ensures each component is fully functional before dependencies are added.

## DECISION REASONING

**Enhanced Pipeline Strategy:**
The new intelligent pipeline includes proactive function validation layers. Since the daemon is running and basic RPC connectivity works, I should validate **all critical daemon functions** that the pool will depend on:

- `getblocktemplate` (pool needs this for work generation)
- Wallet RPC functions (for payments)
- Block generation functions (for testing)
- Network functions (peer connectivity)

By validating these functions **before** starting the pool, I can:
1. Detect and fix issues proactively (e.g., RPC auth failures, missing wallet, disabled functions)
2. Prevent pool startup failures due to daemon issues
3. Use specialized fixer agents to resolve problems automatically
4. Ensure a clean, validated foundation before building dependent components

This is the intelligent enhancement: **validate → fix if needed → re-validate → then proceed**, rather than the old approach of "start and hope it works."

**Current Infrastructure State:**
- Daemon: Running (PIDs 2499, 16201)
- Basic RPC: Working (getblockchaininfo successful)
- Pool: Not running
- Comprehensive daemon function validation: NOT YET DONE

**Next Step:**
Route to `validate_daemon_function` to comprehensively test all daemon RPC functions before proceeding to pool setup.

DECISION: validate_daemon_function
