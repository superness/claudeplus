Excellent! Now I have a complete picture of the infrastructure state:

## Current Infrastructure State Analysis:

**✓ Dependencies**: All binaries installed (bitcoind, mono, cpuminer)

**✓ Daemon**: 
- Process running (PIDs 2499, 3150)
- Config exists with RPC credentials: `coiniumtest / testpass123`
- RPC port 18443
- Wallet has 221 transactions (blocks generated)

**⚠ RPC Authentication Issue**:
- Log shows: "ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt from 127.0.0.1:55076"
- My test used wrong credentials (`pooltest / pooltest123`)
- Correct credentials: `coiniumtest / testpass123`

**✗ Pool**: Not running (no CoiniumServ process detected)

**✗ Ports**: No listening ports detected (18443, 3333, 13333)

**✓ Configs**: Both daemon and pool configs exist

## Strategic Analysis:

The infrastructure is **partially set up** but has a critical issue: **RPC authentication mismatch** detected in logs. This is exactly the type of issue the new **function validation and fixer agents** are designed to catch proactively!

Before proceeding with pool setup, I should **validate daemon RPC functions** to ensure:
1. RPC connectivity is working with correct credentials
2. All required RPC methods are accessible
3. Daemon is in a healthy state for pool operations

This proactive validation will catch configuration issues before they cause pool startup failures.

## Routing Decision:

Since the daemon is running but we detected RPC authentication issues in the logs, and the enhanced pipeline includes proactive function validation, I should route to **validate_rpc_function** first. This will:
- Test RPC connectivity with configured credentials
- Validate all required RPC methods (getblockchaininfo, getblocktemplate, submitblock, etc.)
- Catch any authentication or configuration issues
- If issues found, automatically route to `fix_rpc_function` agent

This demonstrates the **validate → fix → re-validate** intelligent loop for RPC functionality.

DECISION: validate_rpc_function
