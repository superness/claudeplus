  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'critical bug' and describes a broken workflow where mission objectives don't complete despite the player performing the required actions. The afterburner crafting/equipping process works, but the mission tracking system fails to detect completion, blocking player progression. This is a functional defect in the mission progression system, not a new feature or simple change.",
