## EXECUTION REPORT

### Test Execution Summary

**Status:** Completed  
**Automation Method:** WebSocket attempt failed; Browser Console method recommended  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-16T22:30:47.053Z

---

### Evidence Collected

1. **WebSocket Connection Attempt**
   - **File:** `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json`
   - **Status:** FAILED
   - **Error:** `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765`
   - **Reason:** WebSocket server not running (not required for basic testing)

2. **Documentation Review**
   - **Source:** `docs/REMOTE_GAME_CONTROL_TUTORIAL.md`
   - **Finding:** Method 1 (Browser Console Scripts) is the recommended approach for testing
   - **Note:** WebSocket API is an advanced method for full CI/CD automation, but browser console provides the same access to all game systems via `window.simulator`

---

### Observations

- Initial WebSocket automation attempt failed - server not running on port 8765
- Reviewed game automation documentation (REMOTE_GAME_CONTROL_TUTORIAL.md)
- Documentation shows two methods:
  - **Browser Console** (recommended, easy, 30 seconds setup)
  - **WebSocket API** (advanced, for CI/CD, 5 minutes setup)
- Browser console method provides direct access to all game systems via `window.simulator`
- Ship control accessible via: `window.simulator.ship` (position, velocity, maxVelocity, etc.)
- Station management via: `window.simulator.stationManager`
- WebSocket server is NOT required for manual reproduction and debugging
- Game can be launched with `npm run dev` which starts HTTP server on port 8080

---

### Recommended Testing Approach

**Method:** Browser Console (Direct Access)

**Steps:**
1. Launch game: `npm run dev` (starts on http://localhost:8080)
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to Console tab
3. Access simulator: `const sim = window.simulator`
4. Check ship state: `console.log(sim.ship.position, sim.ship.velocity)`
5. Set navigation target manually by clicking/tapping in space
6. Monitor ship velocity: `setInterval(() => console.log('Velocity:', sim.ship.velocity), 1000)`
7. Expected bug: Velocity remains at `{x:0, y:0, z:0}` despite navigation target being set

**Advantages:**
- No WebSocket server setup required
- Immediate access to all game systems
- Can manually trigger bug conditions
- Real-time monitoring of ship state
- Faster iteration for debugging

### Technical Context

**Affected Systems:**
- `MobileInputManager` - Handles tap input detection
- `NavigationManager` - Manages navigation targets
- `ShipPhysics` - Applies movement and velocity
- `EVEPhysics` - Updates position each frame

**Accessible Via:**
- Ship: `window.simulator.ship`
- Physics: `window.simulator.ship.physics` OR `window.simulator.physics`
- Navigation: `window.simulator.navigationManager`
- Mobile Input: `window.simulator.mobileInputManager`

---

### Next Steps

1. Launch game using browser console method
2. Manually reproduce the ship movement bug
3. Use console to inspect ship physics state
4. Identify where navigation targets are set when tapping
5. Check if movement/physics code properly reads navigation targets
6. Verify velocity/position updates each frame
7. Find and fix the bug preventing movement
