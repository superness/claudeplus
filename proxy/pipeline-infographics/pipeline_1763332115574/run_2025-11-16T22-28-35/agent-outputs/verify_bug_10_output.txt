Looking at the evidence from the reproduction attempt, I need to make a verification decision based on the **Bug Existence Verifier** requirements.

## Evidence Analysis

### Runtime Evidence Present?
**NO** - The WebSocket automation framework failed to connect, preventing any runtime testing.

From the evidence files:
- `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json`: Connection refused error
- `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332749906.json`: Connection refused error  
- No WebSocket command/response logs exist
- No game state snapshots captured via `getShipState`
- No actual test execution occurred

### What We Have:
- ✅ Test infrastructure attempted
- ✅ Error logs documenting connection failure
- ✅ Planned test sequence documented
- ❌ **No runtime game state data**
- ❌ **No WebSocket command responses**
- ❌ **No ship position/velocity snapshots**
- ❌ **No evidence of actual ship behavior**

### What We're Missing (Critical):
```json
{
  "commands": [
    {"command": "getShipState", "response": {"position": [0, 0, 0], "velocity": [0, 0, 0]}},
    {"command": "setNavigationTarget", "response": {"success": true}},
    {"command": "getShipState", "response": {"position": [0, 0, 0], "velocity": [0, 0, 0]}}
  ]
}
```

Without these WebSocket responses showing:
1. Initial ship state (position/velocity)
2. Navigation target set successfully
3. Final ship state after waiting (position unchanged = bug confirmed)

We have **ZERO runtime evidence** of the bug.

## Verification Decision

Per the requirements:

> ❌ ALWAYS RETURN "INCONCLUSIVE" IF:
> - No WebSocket automation logs provided
> - No evidence.json file from test execution
> - No game state snapshots captured
> - Only static code analysis (not runtime evidence)

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "WebSocket automation failed to connect to ws://localhost:8765 (ECONNREFUSED). No runtime evidence captured - zero game state snapshots, no command/response logs, no ship position/velocity data. Cannot verify bug existence without actual execution data showing ship failing to move after navigation target is set.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "None - connection failed before any commands sent",
    "stateInconsistency": "Cannot determine - no state snapshots captured",

    "blockingIssues": [
      "WebSocket server not running on port 8765",
      "setNavigationTarget/navigateTo commands not implemented",
      "GameTestingInterface exists but server infrastructure missing"
    ]
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": "REQUIRED: Either (1) Start WebSocket server on port 8765 and re-run automated test, OR (2) Perform manual browser console testing with simulator.ship.setNavigationTarget() and observe ship.mesh.position over time, OR (3) Proceed directly to code inspection (but this won't provide bug confirmation, only hypothesis)"
}
```

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**

---

**Reason:** No runtime evidence exists. The reproduction attempt documented the automation framework's failure to connect, but did not capture any actual game behavior, ship state data, or WebSocket command responses that would prove the bug exists. Static code analysis or infrastructure testing ≠ bug confirmation.

**Required Next Action:** Capture runtime evidence through manual browser testing or fix WebSocket server infrastructure before bug verification is possible.
