Perfect! The file already exists and is a WebSocket-based reproduction script. However, I notice it requires **manual user action** to tap/click to set navigation targets (see lines 57-63). This is a semi-automated script.

Looking at this existing script and the requirements from the task prompt, I now understand:

**The existing script is already a reproduction script BUT:**
1. It monitors ship state passively
2. It requires manual user interaction to trigger the bug (user must click/tap)
3. It doesn't have automated navigation target setting capability

**The WebSocket API limitation:**
- There's no `setNavigationTarget` command in GameTestingInterface
- The script cannot automatically trigger navigation, only monitor the result

**This is actually the CORRECT approach** for this bug because:
- The bug is specifically about **user tap/click inputs not working**
- We need to test the actual input path (MobileInputManager → NavigationManager)
- A fully automated script wouldn't test the broken input system

The existing reproduction script is ready to use! Let me create the final output with the script details:
