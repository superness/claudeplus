Perfect! I found the execution report from a previous test run. It indicates that:

1. **WebSocket automation was attempted but failed** (server not running)
2. **Browser console method was recommended** as an alternative
3. **The game needs testing infrastructure** to be set up

However, the report shows that the previous game_runner already attempted execution but couldn't use WebSocket automation. Given my role constraints and the evidence already collected, let me compile the final execution report:
