## Bug Existence Verification Analysis

### Evidence Review

**Evidence File:** `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json`

**Contents:**
- `timestamp`: 2025-11-16T22:30:41.975Z
- `stateSnapshots`: [] (empty)
- `commands`: [] (empty)
- `error`: "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765"
- `status`: "ERROR"

### Critical Analysis

#### Runtime Evidence Present: ❌ NO

The evidence file shows:
1. **No WebSocket automation logs** - Connection failed before any commands could be sent
2. **No game state snapshots** - Empty `stateSnapshots` array
3. **No command execution** - Empty `commands` array
4. **Connection error** - WebSocket server was not running

#### What This Means

The reproduction attempt **failed to execute** due to WebSocket server not being available. This means:
- No actual runtime testing occurred
- No ship state was captured during gameplay
- No navigation commands were sent to the game
- No velocity/position data was collected
- No before/after comparison is possible

### Evidence Requirements Not Met

According to the verification requirements:

**❌ ALWAYS RETURN "INCONCLUSIVE" IF:**
- ✅ No WebSocket automation logs provided
- ✅ No evidence.json file from test execution (file exists but is empty)
- ✅ No game state snapshots captured
- ✅ Only static code analysis (not runtime evidence)

**This case matches all four criteria for INCONCLUSIVE verdict.**

### What Would Constitute Valid Evidence

To confirm this bug, we would need:
```json
{
  "stateSnapshots": [
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "shipState": {
        "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
        "velocity": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},
        "navigationTarget": {"x": 1000, "y": 0, "z": 0}
      }
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "... (5 seconds later)",
      "shipState": {
        "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},  // Still at origin
        "velocity": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0},  // Still not moving
        "navigationTarget": {"x": 1000, "y": 0, "z": 0}  // Target still set
      }
    }
  ],
  "commands": [
    {"command": "setNavigationTarget", "response": {"success": true}},
    {"command": "getShipState", "response": {"velocity": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}}}
  ]
}
```

This would show:
- Navigation target was successfully set
- Ship velocity remained at zero despite target being set
- Ship position did not change over time
- **BUG CONFIRMED** via runtime evidence

### Recommendation

The reproduction report correctly identified that the **Browser Console method** is the recommended approach. The next step would be:

1. **Manual Testing via Browser:**
   - Launch game with `npm run dev`
   - Open browser DevTools console
   - Set navigation target by clicking/tapping
   - Monitor: `window.simulator.ship.velocity`
   - Capture actual runtime state

2. **Alternative: Start WebSocket Server (if automation preferred):**
   - Follow setup in `docs/REMOTE_GAME_CONTROL_TUTORIAL.md`
   - Start WebSocket server on port 8765
   - Re-run automation script to collect evidence

### Conclusion

**Verification Status:** INCONCLUSIVE

**Reasoning:**
- WebSocket connection failed (ECONNREFUSED)
- No runtime evidence collected
- No game state snapshots captured
- No command execution logs
- Empty evidence arrays indicate test never ran

**Evidence Analysis:**
```json
{
  "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
  "websocketResponses": "None - connection refused",
  "stateInconsistency": "Unable to determine - no state captured",
  "matchesBugReport": "Cannot verify without runtime evidence"
}
```

**Confidence:** 0.0 (No runtime data to analyze)

**Next Steps:**
1. Use Browser Console method for immediate manual reproduction
2. OR set up WebSocket server for automated testing
3. Collect actual runtime game state showing ship not moving
4. Re-run verification with valid evidence

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**
