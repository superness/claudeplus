  "hypothesis": "The bug likely occurs at one of these integration points: (1) Tap/click events are not being converted to world-space coordinates correctly, (2) Navigation targets are being set but not propagated to the ship's physics system, (3) ShipPhysics is not reading the navigation target to calculate desired velocity, (4) EVEPhysics update loop is not being called or is not applying velocity to position, (5) There's a conditional check preventing movement (e.g., docked status, autopilot disabled). Most likely: the navigation target is set but the ship's autopilot/movement system is not actively steering toward it in the physics update loop."
