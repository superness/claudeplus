# Bug Verification Analysis

## Evidence Review

### Runtime Evidence Status
**❌ NO RUNTIME EVIDENCE CAPTURED**

From the evidence files:

1. **ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763332247053.json**:
   - `"stateSnapshots": []` - No game state captured
   - `"commands": []` - No WebSocket commands executed
   - `"error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765"` - WebSocket server not running
   - `"status": "ERROR"` - Test execution failed

2. **ship_movement_bug_execution_report.json**:
   - `"automationUsed": false` - No automation ran
   - `"automationMethod": "browser_console_recommended"` - Only a recommendation, not executed
   - No actual test execution occurred
   - Only documentation review and recommendations provided

### What Was Actually Done
The reproduction attempt only:
- ✅ Tried to connect to WebSocket server (failed)
- ✅ Reviewed documentation for testing methods
- ✅ Created a plan for manual browser console testing
- ❌ Did NOT launch the game and run tests
- ❌ Did NOT capture ship state snapshots
- ❌ Did NOT execute navigation commands
- ❌ Did NOT monitor velocity changes
- ❌ Did NOT confirm bug through runtime observation

### Evidence Analysis
```json
{
  "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
  "websocketResponses": "None - WebSocket server connection failed, no commands executed",
  "stateSnapshots": "Empty array - no game state captured",
  "actualTestingPerformed": false,
  "onlyStaticAnalysis": true,
  "documentationReviewOnly": true
}
```

## Verification Decision

Per the verification requirements:

**❌ ALWAYS RETURN "INCONCLUSIVE" IF:**
- ✅ No WebSocket automation logs provided ← **TRUE** (commands array empty)
- ✅ No evidence.json file from test execution ← **TRUE** (file shows error, no data)
- ✅ No game state snapshots captured ← **TRUE** (stateSnapshots array empty)
- ✅ Only static code analysis (not runtime evidence) ← **TRUE** (only docs reviewed)

The evidence files show:
- An **attempt** to set up automation (failed)
- A **plan** for manual testing (not executed)
- **Zero runtime data** from the actual game
- **Zero state snapshots** showing ship velocity/position
- **Zero command/response logs** from navigation testing

This is equivalent to:
- Writing a test script but never running it
- Opening a debugger but not setting breakpoints
- Planning an experiment but not conducting it

## Conclusion

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "No runtime evidence exists. WebSocket automation failed to connect and was never executed. The 'evidence' file contains only error logs from failed connection attempts and documentation review notes. No game state was captured, no ship movement was tested, no velocity monitoring was performed. The execution report explicitly states 'automationUsed: false' and only provides a 'recommendedApproach' for future testing.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "None - server connection refused, no commands executed",
    "stateInconsistency": "Cannot determine - no state snapshots captured",
    "matchesBugReport": "Unknown - bug was not reproduced or tested",
    "actualTestingPerformed": false,
    "dataQuality": "No runtime data - only static planning and documentation review"
  },
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "nextSteps": "Must perform actual runtime testing using either: (1) Browser console method as recommended in the execution report, (2) Set up WebSocket server and run automation script, or (3) Manual testing with DevTools to capture ship state before/after navigation commands. Currently have zero empirical evidence of the bug's existence."
}
```

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (No runtime evidence - testing infrastructure failed, no actual game state captured or commands executed)
