Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile my review.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

The extracted requirements are **COMPLETE and FAITHFUL** to the original design documents. I verified:

**Testing Arena (Proving Grounds) - COMPLETE:**
- ✓ Access at Level 3 after "Weight of Choice" quest
- ✓ Faction locations (Schola Progenium, Fire Caste Training Dome, Da Fightin' Pit)
- ✓ Target Dummy specs (Infinite HP, adjustable armor: 0/50/100/150/200/300)
- ✓ Combat Dummy specs (HP: 200/500/1000/2000/5000, DPS: 0/15/35/60/100/150/200)
- ✓ All 6 difficulty presets with exact values (Learning→Apex)
- ✓ DPS meter specs (5s/30s/60s windows, 0.5s update rate)
- ✓ Skill validation feedback messages (RECHARGING, NOT ENOUGH ENERGY, etc.)
- ✓ Zero rewards policy (no XP, currency, loot)
- ✓ Faction theming (Imperial terminology: "Acceptable"→"Exemplary", Tau: "Suboptimal"→"Optimal", Ork: "Weedy"→"WAAAGH! WORTHY")

**Skill System - COMPLETE:**
- ✓ All 9 skill categories captured (MELEE_ATTACK, RANGED_ATTACK, SPELL, HEAL, BUFF, DEBUFF, SHOUT, TRAP, STANCE)
- ✓ All target types documented (SINGLE, ENEMY, ALLY, SELF, GROUND, CONE, PBAE, PARTY)
- ✓ Range values match (melee=2, ranged=15-40, party buffs=600-800 units)
- ✓ Damage type armor interactions preserved (Kinetic=full, Piercing=25% ignore, Rending=50% ignore, Thermal=ignores armor)
- ✓ Condition specifications with stacks/durations (Bleeding: 5 stacks, 6s; Burning: 3 stacks, 4s; etc.)
- ✓ Immunity system documented (Stun: 8s, Knockdown: 6s, Fear: 10s, Taunt: 15s)

**Skill Audit Issues Correctly Identified:**
- ✓ GROUND-targeted skills need position targeting (Frag Grenade, EMP Grenade, Photon Grenade)
- ✓ CONE skills need facing direction validation (Suppressive Fire, Righteous Fury)
- ✓ BUFF/DEBUFF skills may not be applying actual effects (Markerlight noted as "handled separately")
- ✓ Condition immunity system not fully implemented

**DPS Targets Match Design Docs:**
- ✓ Choppa Boy: 175-200 DPS (melee pure DPS)
- ✓ Fire Warrior: 170-190 DPS (ranged pure DPS)
- ✓ Battle Sister: 120-140 DPS (hybrid)
- ✓ Water Caste: 100-130 DPS (support)

### Implementation Checklist Validated

The 36 skills in the seed file match the documented values:
- Holy Strike: 80 damage, 4s CD, 10 energy ✓
- Frag Grenade: 70 damage, 10s CD, 15 energy ✓
- CHOP!: 70 damage + BLEEDING, 3s CD, 8 energy ✓
- Pulse Volley: 70 damage, 4s CD, 10 energy ✓

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements capture the design intent accurately. The extraction correctly identified:
1. Complete Proving Grounds specifications from testing-arena-design.md
2. All skill mechanics from combat-design.md
3. DPS balance targets from balance-analysis.md
4. Current implementation gaps (GROUND targeting, BUFF/DEBUFF effects, condition immunities)

The implementation checklist is comprehensive and actionable.
