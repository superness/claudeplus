I've created the Testing Arena design document. Here's a summary of what I designed:

## Testing Arena Design Summary

### The Problem You Described
You mentioned enemies "obliterate me with 1000 hits in an instant" - this is likely because:
1. Enemy DPS in the current test environment may not match the design doc specifications
2. Per the combat design doc, enemies should deal `DPS × 1.5` damage every 1.5 seconds, not continuous damage

### What the Proving Grounds Provides

**Three Dummy Types:**
1. **Target Dummy (Passive)** - Infinite HP, adjustable armor (0-400), zero attacks. Pure DPS testing.
2. **Combat Dummy (Active)** - Adjustable HP (200-5000), adjustable DPS (0-300). You control how hard it hits back!
3. **Condition Dummy** - For testing status effects like Burning, Bleeding, Stun, etc.

**DPS Meter & Skill Validation:**
- Real-time DPS display (5s, 30s, 60s windows)
- Damage breakdown by skill and type
- Skill audit mode that validates if skills work correctly vs their tooltips
- Range indicators showing when you're "OUT OF RANGE"
- Condition tracking showing stacks and durations

**Difficulty Presets** (matching the combat design doc enemy stats):
| Preset | DPS | Based On |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Learning | 15 | Gretchin |
| Practice | 35 | Slugga Boy |
| Challenge | 60 | Fire Warrior |
| Veteran | 100 | Elite Enemy |
| Nightmare | 150 | Boss-tier |
| Apex | 200 | Raid Boss |

**Key Features:**
- **No rewards** (prevents farming exploits - matches GW1 Isle of the Nameless)
- **Faction-themed** (Imperial Schola, Tau Training Dome, Ork Fightin' Pit)
- **Group mode** for party practice (tank training, healer training, DPS checks)
- **Instant reset** - no waiting

The skill audit section also documents what to test for each skill type (range validation, target types, condition application) which will help identify any skills that "don't always seem to work."
