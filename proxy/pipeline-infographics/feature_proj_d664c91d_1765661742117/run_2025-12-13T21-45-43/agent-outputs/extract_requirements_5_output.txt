#### IV. KNOWN SKILL VALIDATION ISSUES (From Testing Arena Design)

```
1. RANGE VALIDATION:
├── Melee skills (range: 2 units) - Should hit at melee range only
├── Ground-targeted AoE (range: 20-25 units) - Can target ground within range
├── GROUND type skills require explicit position targeting which isn't fully wired

2. TARGET TYPE VALIDATION:
├── GROUND skills need position targeting support
├── CONE skills need facing direction checks
├── PARTY skills need party member detection within range

3. CONDITION APPLICATION:
├── Stun: Should respect immunity (8 sec after stun ends)
├── Knockdown: Should respect immunity (6 sec)
├── Fear: Should respect immunity (10 sec)
├── Taunt: Should respect immunity (15 sec)

4. BUFF/DEBUFF CATEGORIES:
├── BUFF skills just fire events but don't apply actual effects yet
├── DEBUFF skills (like Markerlight) have special handling noted as "handled separately"
```

```
