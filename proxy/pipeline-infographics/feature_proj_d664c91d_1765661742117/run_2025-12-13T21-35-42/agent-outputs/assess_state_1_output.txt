Now I have a good picture of the project. Let me provide my assessment.

## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - fully implemented Three.js-based game client in `/client/` with Vite build system
- **Design docs**: Multiple design documents exist:
  - `combat-design.md` - Combat mechanics, damage types, skills
  - `balance-analysis.md` - Balance analysis
  - `progression-design.md` - Leveling/progression
  - `henchmen-heroes-design.md` - Companion system
  - `visual-combat-design.md` - Visual effects
  - And more...
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express API backend with:
  - Authentication (JWT)
  - Character management
  - Combat service
  - WebSocket handlers
  - PostgreSQL database with migrations
- **Can run**: Yes - has `npm run dev` for both client and server

### What Exists:
- **36 skills** defined across 4 classes (Battle Sister, Guardsman, Choppa Boy, Fire Warrior)
- **30+ enemy templates** with different DPS values (8-220 base DPS)
- Full combat validation, damage calculation with armor penetration
- Visual effects system (projectiles, explosions, heals, etc.)
- Enemy AI system with attack cooldowns

### Your Reported Issues:
1. **Skills not always working** - The system has validation (energy, cooldown, range checks) that may silently fail
2. **Getting obliterated** - The enemy DPS values are HIGH:
   - Common enemies: 18-55 DPS
   - Elite enemies: 65-200 DPS  
   - Bosses: 180-220 DPS
   - With 1.5s attack cooldown, that's 27-330 damage PER ATTACK

The current "testing area" spawns these enemies at full strength, which is clearly too punishing for testing skills.

## Recommendation

The client exists and is ready for feature work. The two priority improvements you mentioned are:
1. **Audit skills** to ensure they all work correctly and provide feedback
2. **Create a better testing area** with weaker enemies or adjusted settings

DECISION: ready_for_features
