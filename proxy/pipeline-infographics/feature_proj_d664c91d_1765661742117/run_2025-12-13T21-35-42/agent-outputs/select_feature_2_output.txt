Now I have a clear picture. Based on my analysis:

## Next Feature: Skill Audit & Testing Arena

### Already Implemented
- **36 skills** across 4 classes (Battle Sister, Guardsman, Choppa Boy, Fire Warrior) with full definitions
- Combat validation system that checks: range, target, energy, cooldown, status effects
- CombatManager that routes skill execution through validation → damage calculation → enemy HP
- EnemyAI with aggressive attack behavior (1.5s attack cooldown, damage = DPS × 1.5 per hit)
- Visual skill effects system (SkillEffects.ts)
- Enemy templates with DPS values ranging from 8 (Gretchin) to 220 (Warboss)

### From Design Docs
The combat-design.md references:
- Guild Wars 1-style skill bar (8 regular + 1 elite)
- Status effect system with 18+ conditions
- Damage types with armor penetration values
- Attribute scaling for skills

### Why This Feature Next
Based on your feedback, there are TWO interconnected issues:

1. **Skills not working** - Looking at the code, skills can fail silently due to:
   - Range checks (melee = 2 units, which is very close)
   - No visible feedback when validation fails (logs go to console only)
   - Ground-targeted skills (GROUND type) require explicit position targeting which isn't fully wired
   - Some skill categories like BUFF/DEBUFF just fire events but don't apply actual effects yet

2. **Getting obliterated** - Enemy DPS is brutal:
   - Enemies deal `DPS × 1.5` damage per attack every 1.5 seconds
   - A common Guardsman (35 DPS) deals ~53 damage per hit
   - Elite Space Marines (120 DPS) deal ~180 damage per hit
   - Player character likely has ~300-500 HP at low level
   - No proper testing arena with adjustable difficulty

**Both issues need to be addressed together** because you can't properly test skills if you die instantly, and fixing skill issues requires a stable testing environment.
