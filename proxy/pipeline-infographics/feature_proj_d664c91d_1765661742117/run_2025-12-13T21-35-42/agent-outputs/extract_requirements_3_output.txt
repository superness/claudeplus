### What IS Specified

1. **36 skills across 4 classes** with exact damage, energy costs, cooldowns, ranges, target types
2. **Skill range values**: Melee = 2 units, Ranged = 15-40 units, Charge = 8-10 units
3. **Damage calculation formula**: `Base × Attribute × Armor × Crit × Conditions`
4. **Enemy DPS and HP values** for all enemy types
5. **Status effect durations and damage values**
6. **Player HP formula by level**
7. **Guild Wars 1-style combat philosophy** (skill-based, no auto-attack, 8-slot bar)

### What is NOT Specified (Needs Design)

1. **Training Dummy specifics**:
   - What stats should training dummies have?
   - How many HP?
   - What armor rating?
   - Should they fight back or be passive?
   - Should they display DPS metrics?

2. **Testing Arena specifics**:
   - Location/map for testing arena
   - Adjustable difficulty settings
   - Enemy spawn controls
   - Respawn/reset mechanics

3. **Skill validation feedback**:
   - How to communicate "out of range" to player
   - How to communicate "on cooldown" to player
   - How to communicate "not enough energy" to player
   - Visual/audio feedback for skill failures

From `visual-combat-design.md` - this IS specified:
> ```
> SKILL FEEDBACK:
> ├── Activation: "[Skill Name]" (white, center-bottom)
> ├── On Cooldown: "RECHARGING" (red, skill bar area)
> ├── No Energy: "NOT ENOUGH ENERGY" (orange)
> ├── Out of Range: "OUT OF RANGE" (grey)
> ├── Invalid Target: "INVALID TARGET" (red)
> └── Interrupted: "INTERRUPTED!" (red, shake)
> ```

### Implementation Checklist

**Skills Audit (specifications exist):**
- [ ] Verify all 36 skills match design doc specifications (damage, cooldown, energy, range)
- [ ] Verify melee range = 2 units is appropriate (may need adjustment)
- [ ] Verify GROUND target type skills work with position targeting
- [ ] Verify CONE target type skills work with directional targeting
- [ ] Verify PBAE (point-blank AoE) skills work around caster
- [ ] Verify PARTY target type skills hit all allies in range
- [ ] Verify condition application works (Burning, Bleeding, Stun, etc.)
- [ ] Verify condition removal works (Cleansing Flame removes Bleeding/Poison)
- [ ] Verify skill feedback messages appear (Out of Range, On Cooldown, etc.)
- [ ] Audit skill validation logic for silent failures

**Testing Arena (needs design for specifics):**
- [ ] Design training dummy stats (HP, armor, passive vs active)
- [ ] Design arena location and access method
- [ ] Design difficulty adjustment system (enemy DPS scaling)
- [ ] Implement training dummy that doesn't attack back
- [ ] Implement DPS meter / damage feedback for testing
- [ ] Implement enemy spawn controls with adjustable difficulty
- [ ] Implement instant respawn for testing purposes
