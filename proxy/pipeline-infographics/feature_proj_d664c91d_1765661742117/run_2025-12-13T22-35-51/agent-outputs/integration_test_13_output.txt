### Visual Issues Found

2. **Floating damage numbers inconsistent** - Only visible in screenshot 07, missing from most combat screenshots
3. **No visible skill particle effects** - Skills show text labels but no visual particle/projectile effects
4. **No skill cooldown visualization** - Cannot tell from skill bar which skills are on cooldown
5. **No loot system visible** - Enemy deaths don't drop visible loot
6. **No death animation** - Enemies appear to just disappear on death
7. **No hit feedback** - No screen flash or effect when player takes damage

### Summary
- **Functional Tests:** 11/12 passed (92%)
- **Visual Checks:** 35/47 individual checklist items passed (74%)
- **Critical Visual Issues:**
  - Missing floating damage numbers (inconsistent display)
  - No skill particle/projectile effects visible
  - No dedicated target frame UI
  - No loot drop visuals
  - Skill cooldown state not visible on skill bar

The core combat system is functional - skills deal damage, enemies take damage, health bars update, companions engage in combat. However, visual feedback is lacking in several areas that would improve the gameplay experience.
