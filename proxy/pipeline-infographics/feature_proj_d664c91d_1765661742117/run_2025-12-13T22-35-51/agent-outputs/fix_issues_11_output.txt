## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Skills not consistently working
- **File:** `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts`
- **Fix:** Changed `equipDefaultSkills()` to use `getDefaultLoadout('BATTLE_SISTER')` instead of arbitrarily picking the first 8 skills from ALL_SKILLS. This ensures the skills equipped in CombatManager match what SkillBar displays to the user. Also added a new `setCharacterClass()` method for future class switching.

### Issue 2: Enemy damage too high - getting "obliterated with 1000 hits in an instant"
- **File:** `client/src/game/entities/EnemyAI.ts`
- **Fix:** Reduced `DAMAGE_SCALE` from 0.15 to 0.05 and increased `ATTACK_COOLDOWN` from 4.0 to 5.0 seconds. This means a 100 DPS enemy now does approximately 25 damage per 5-second attack instead of 60 damage per 4-second attack - a 70% reduction in effective damage.

### Issue 3: Enemies too close to spawn - no safe testing area
- **File:** `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- **Fix:** Moved ALL demo enemies much further from spawn (30+ units away). The area around (0,0) to ~20 units is now reserved for the Proving Grounds testing dummies only:
  - Imperial enemies: moved from 15-25 units to 35-50 units (far north)
  - Tau enemies: moved from 25-40 units to 45-60 units (far east)  
  - Ork enemies: moved from 20-30 units to 40-50 units (far south)
  - Tyranid enemies: moved from 20-28 units to 40-48 units (far west)
  - Chaos enemies: moved from 15-30 units to 35-50 units (far northwest)
  - Bosses: moved from 45-50 units to 65-70 units (very far)

**Testing Area Layout:**
- **Near spawn (0,0):** Safe zone with Target Dummies (northwest) and one low-DPS Combat Dummy (south)
- **30+ units away:** All hostile enemies that fight back
- **60+ units away:** Boss enemies for challenging content

Players can now safely test all 9 skills on the Target Dummies in the Proving Grounds without being attacked by real enemies!
