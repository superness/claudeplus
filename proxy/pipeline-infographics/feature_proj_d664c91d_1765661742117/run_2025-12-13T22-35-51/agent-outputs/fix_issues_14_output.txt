## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Skills not working on Proving Grounds dummies
- **Root Cause**: The `TargetDummy` and `CombatDummy` classes in `ProvingGrounds.ts` were custom objects that couldn't be targeted by the skill system, which expected proper `Enemy` objects managed by `EntityManager`.
- **File**: `client/src/game/entities/EnemyTemplates.ts`
- **Fix**: Added 4 new training dummy enemy templates:
  - `TRAINING_DUMMY_BASIC` - 99999 HP, 0 armor, no attacks
  - `TRAINING_DUMMY_ARMORED` - 99999 HP, 100 armor, no attacks
  - `TRAINING_DUMMY_HEAVY` - 99999 HP, 200 armor, no attacks
  - `COMBAT_DUMMY` - 1000 HP, 50 armor, 5 DPS (for survivability testing)

### Issue 2: Dummies not selectable as targets
- **File**: `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- **Fix**: Rewrote `setupProvingGrounds()` to spawn dummies as proper `Enemy` objects via `EntityManager.spawnEnemyDirect()` instead of using the custom ProvingGrounds classes. This allows Tab-targeting and click-targeting to work.

### Issue 3: Training dummies attacking players
- **File**: `client/src/game/entities/EnemyAI.ts`
- **Fix**: Added check at the start of `makeDecision()` to return `IDLE` for enemies with `NO_ATTACK` or `NO_AGGRO` tags in their template. Training dummies now stand still and don't pursue or attack.

### Issue 4: Training area visibility
- **File**: `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- **Fix**: Added `createTrainingAreaMarker()` which creates:
  - A green ground ring showing the safe training zone
  - A floating "TRAINING AREA" label above the dummies

### Training Area Layout
- 3 Target Dummies at positions (5, 0, 5), (8, 0, 5), (11, 0, 5) - easily visible in front of spawn
- 1 Combat Dummy at (10, 0, -3) - to the side for survivability practice
- All real enemies remain 35+ units away from spawn
