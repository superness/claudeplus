Let me summarize the implementation:

## Implemented

### Skill System Fixes
1. **Added new status effects** in `CombatSystem.ts`:
   - `PROTECTION` - +10% armor per stack (up to 5 stacks = +50%)
   - `VULNERABILITY` - +15% damage taken per stack (up to 3 stacks = +45%)
   - `FURY` - +10% damage per stack (up to 5 stacks)
   - `WEAKNESS` - -10% damage dealt per stack

2. **Fixed skills to apply proper effects** in `Skills.ts`:
   - `Markerlight` now applies `VULNERABILITY` (+15% damage taken)
   - `Penitent's Resolve` now applies 2 stacks of `PROTECTION` (+20% armor)
   - `Blessed Refrain` now applies 1 stack of `PROTECTION` (+10% armor)
   - `'Ard as Nails` now applies 5 stacks of `PROTECTION` (+50% armor)
   - `Cover Formation` now applies 2 stacks of `PROTECTION` (+20% armor)

3. **Fixed CombatManager damage calculations** in `CombatManager.ts`:
   - `applyDamageToTarget()`: Now calculates damage bonus from MIGHT stacks (+3% per stack) and VULNERABILITY on target (+15% per stack)
   - `handleEnemyAttack()`: Now checks for AEGIS (blocks attack), applies PROTECTION armor bonus when calculating damage reduction

### Proving Grounds Enhancements
4. **Added CombatDummy class** in `ProvingGrounds.ts`:
   - Has HP (configurable), attacks back
   - Auto-respawns after 3 seconds when destroyed
   - Visual health bar and damage flash feedback
   - Configurable DPS for survival testing

5. **Added DPSMeterUI class** in `ProvingGrounds.ts`:
   - Displays 5s/30s/60s DPS windows
   - Shows total damage dealt
   - Dark red themed UI matching 40K aesthetic

6. **Added methods to ProvingGrounds class**:
   - `spawnCombatDummy(position, health, dps)` - Spawn a combat dummy
   - `onPlayerDamage(callback)` - Handle combat dummy attacks
   - `showDPSMeter()` / `hideDPSMeter()` - Toggle DPS meter UI

### Enemy Balance Adjustments
7. **Reduced enemy attack rate** in `EnemyAI.ts`:
   - Increased `ATTACK_COOLDOWN` from 1.5s to 3.0s
   - Added `DAMAGE_SCALE = 0.33` to reduce damage per attack
   - Net effect: Enemies deal their base DPS over time rather than burst damage

## Design Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| MIGHT: +3% damage per stack (up to 25 stacks = +75%) | `applyDamageToTarget()` reads MIGHT stacks and adds `stacks * 3` to damageBonus |
| VULNERABILITY: +15% damage taken per stack | `applyDamageToTarget()` checks target for VULNERABILITY and adds `stacks * 15` to damageBonus |
| PROTECTION: +10% armor per stack | `handleEnemyAttack()` increases effectiveArmor by `stacks * 10%` |
| AEGIS: Block next attack | `handleEnemyAttack()` checks for AEGIS and cancels attack if present |
| Markerlight applies vulnerability | Changed `appliesEffects: []` to `appliesEffects: ['VULNERABILITY']` |
| Armor buff skills apply PROTECTION | Added PROTECTION stacks to Penitent's Resolve (2), 'Ard as Nails (5), Cover Formation (2), Blessed Refrain (1) |
| DPS Meter with 5s/30s/60s windows | DPSMeterUI class tracks and displays all three windows |
| Combat Dummy attacks back | CombatDummy class with configurable DPS, 1-second attack interval |

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/combat/CombatSystem.ts` - Added PROTECTION, VULNERABILITY, FURY, WEAKNESS status effects
2. `client/src/combat/Skills.ts` - Fixed Markerlight, armor buff skills to apply effects
3. `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts` - Fixed damage bonus calculations for MIGHT/VULNERABILITY, added AEGIS blocking, added PROTECTION armor bonus
4. `client/src/combat/ProvingGrounds.ts` - Added CombatDummy class, DPSMeterUI class, spawning methods
5. `client/src/game/entities/EnemyAI.ts` - Increased attack cooldown, reduced damage scaling

## How to Test

1. **Test Skill Buffs/Debuffs**:
   - Use `WAAAGH!` skill (Ork) - should apply MIGHT stacks and increase damage
   - Use `Markerlight` (Tau) on enemy - next attacks should deal +15% damage
   - Use `'Ard as Nails` (Ork) - should reduce incoming damage by ~33% (50% more armor)

2. **Test Proving Grounds**:
   ```typescript
   // In game, access proving grounds
   provingGrounds.spawnTargetDummy(position, 100);  // Armor 100
   provingGrounds.spawnCombatDummy(position, 1000, 35);  // 1000 HP, 35 DPS
   provingGrounds.showDPSMeter();
   ```

3. **Test Enemy Damage Reduction**:
   - Enemies now attack every 3 seconds instead of 1.5 seconds
   - Damage per attack is reduced to match their listed DPS
