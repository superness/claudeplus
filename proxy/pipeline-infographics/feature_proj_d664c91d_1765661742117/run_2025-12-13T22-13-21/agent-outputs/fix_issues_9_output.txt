TypeScript compiles without errors. Let me output a summary of the fixes applied.

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Missing `useEnergy()` method on Player class
- **File**: `client/src/game/entities/Player.ts`
- **Fix**: Added `useEnergy(amount: number)` method at line 475 that deducts energy from player stats

### Issue 2: Missing `getRotation()` method on Player class
- **File**: `client/src/game/entities/Player.ts`
- **Fix**: Added `getRotation(): THREE.Euler` method at line 482 that returns a clone of the player's rotation

### Issue 3: Status effects never expire
- **File**: `client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts`
- **Fix**: Added duration decrement logic in the `update()` method (lines 809-831) that:
  - Decrements `playerStatusEffects` durations each frame
  - Removes expired effects and logs expiration
  - Decrements `enemyStatusEffects` durations for all enemies
  - Cleans up empty effect maps

### Issue 4: ProvingGrounds not integrated into Game.ts
- **File**: `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- **Fix**: 
  - Added import for `ProvingGrounds` from `'../combat/ProvingGrounds'`
  - Added `provingGrounds: ProvingGrounds` class member
  - Initialized ProvingGrounds in constructor
  - Added `setupProvingGrounds()` method that:
    - Spawns 4 target dummies with varying armor (0, 50, 100, 150) for DPS testing
    - Spawns 1 combat dummy with 500 HP and only 10 DPS (manageable for testing)
    - Wires combat dummy attacks to damage the player
    - Shows the DPS meter UI
  - Added `update()` call in game loop
  - Added `dispose()` cleanup
  - Added `getProvingGrounds()` getter
