Perfect! The reproduction script is ready. Let me create a summary document:

## Ship Fitting Persistence Bug - Reproduction Script Ready

I've updated the existing reproduction script at `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_ship_fitting_persistence.js` to match your requirements.

### Test Scenario

The script automates the following steps:

1. **Find and dock at station** - Locates nearest station and docks (fitting requires being docked)
2. **Add test items to inventory** - Adds Mining Laser I and Afterburner I to player inventory
3. **Fit items to ship slots**:
   - Mining Laser I → High slot 0
   - Afterburner I → Mid slot 0
4. **Verify items are fitted** - Confirms items appear in ship fitting slots via `getFittedItems()` command
5. **Trigger save** - Calls `saveGame()` command to save state to localStorage
6. **Print manual verification instructions** - Displays clear instructions for the manual test portion

### What Gets Verified Automatically

✅ Items can be added to inventory  
✅ Items can be fitted to ship slots  
✅ Fitted items are readable via `getFittedItems()` API  
✅ Save triggers successfully  
✅ Evidence file contains all command responses and console logs

### Manual Verification Step

The script **cannot** automatically close and reopen the browser, so it prints these instructions:

```
MANUAL TEST REQUIRED:
1. Check browser console for save messages
2. CLOSE CHROME COMPLETELY (not just tab - entire browser)
3. REOPEN Chrome and navigate to the game
4. After game loads, check ship fitting:
   - Dock at station
   - Open ship fitting interface
   - Verify Mining Laser I is in high slot 0
   - Verify Afterburner I is in mid slot 0

If items are NOT restored after reopening:
🐛 BUG REPRODUCED - Fitted items not persisting

If items ARE restored after reopening:
✅ Bug NOT reproduced - Persistence working
```

### Running the Script

```bash
node test_ship_fitting_persistence.js
```

The script will:
- Launch Chrome using ChromeManager
- Execute the test sequence
- Generate evidence file: `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`
- Parse and include console logs
- Display manual verification instructions

### Evidence Collection

The script captures:
- All command requests and responses
- Browser console logs (parsed from Chrome's console output)
- Console error and exception counts
- Timestamps for each step
- Complete test metadata
