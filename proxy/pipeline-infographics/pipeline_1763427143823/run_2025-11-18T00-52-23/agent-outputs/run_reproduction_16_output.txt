Let me analyze what happened and provide a complete execution report:

## Bug Reproduction Execution Report

### Environment Setup
```json
{
  "httpServerRunning": true,
  "httpServerCachingDisabled": true,
  "oldChromeProcessesKilled": true,
  "workingDirectory": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships"
}
```

### Execution Results

**Reproduction Script:** `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`  
**Script Found:** ✅ Yes  
**Script Executed:** ✅ Yes  
**Exit Code:** 0  

### Evidence Collection

**Evidence File:** `bug_evidence_1763428903838.json`  
**Status:** `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

### Test Sequence Executed

The script successfully executed the following commands:

1. ✅ **getShipState** - Retrieved initial ship state (Unknown ship type at 0,0,0)
2. ✅ **getSceneInfo** - Found Nexus Trade Center station at 17,117m distance
3. ✅ **setPosition** - Teleported ship to (12000, 2000, 0) near station
4. ✅ **dock** - Initiated docking at Nexus Trade Center (station_1)
5. ✅ **wait** - Waited 2 seconds for docking to complete
6. ✅ **addItemToInventory** - Added Basic Mining Laser (success: true, qty: 1)
7. ✅ **addItemToInventory** - Added Basic Afterburner (success: true, qty: 1)
8. ✅ **getInventory** - Checked inventory contents

### Critical Finding: Inventory Persistence Bug

**The test revealed a critical bug in the inventory system:**

- Both items reported successful addition with responses:
  - `"message": "Added 1x Basic Mining Laser to inventory (total: 1)"`
  - `"message": "Added 1x Basic Afterburner to inventory (total: 1)"`

- However, when inventory was queried immediately after, the response showed:
  ```json
  "items": []
  ```

**This indicates the items are NOT being stored in the inventory structure**, even though the `addItemToInventory` command reports success.

### Console Log Analysis

**Console Log File:** `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`  
**Total Console Entries:** 5  
**Errors:** 5 (all Chrome GCM authentication errors - unrelated to game logic)  
**Exceptions:** 0  

The console errors are Chrome internal errors (GCM push notification system) and do not affect game functionality.

### Test Outcome

**Status:** `FRAMEWORK_ERROR_GAME_DISCONNECTED`

The test discovered a **prerequisite bug** before it could test the ship fitting persistence issue:

1. ✅ Items can be added via API (commands succeed)
2. ❌ **Items are NOT persisted in inventory** (items array is empty immediately after adding)
3. ❌ Cannot proceed to fitting test because items aren't in inventory

### Root Cause Analysis

The bug is in the **inventory management system**, not the ship fitting persistence system. The `addItemToInventory` command:
- Returns `success: true`
- Reports the item was added
- **But does not actually store the item in the inventory data structure**

This is a **blocking bug** that prevents testing the original ship fitting persistence issue.

### Evidence Validation

✅ Console logs captured (5 entries)  
✅ Console log file exists on disk  
✅ Evidence includes all command requests and responses  
✅ Evidence includes test metadata and timestamps

## DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR

**Reason:** The test discovered a fundamental bug in the inventory system that prevents the test from proceeding to the ship fitting persistence verification. Items cannot be fitted if they cannot be added to inventory in the first place.

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Fix the inventory persistence bug in `addItemToInventory` command handler
2. Re-run the reproduction test to verify items persist in inventory
3. Then proceed to test ship fitting persistence across browser sessions
