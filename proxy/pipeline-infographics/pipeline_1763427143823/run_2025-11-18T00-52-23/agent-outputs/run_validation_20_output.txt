### What Was Validated

✅ **All automated tests passed:**
- Ship can dock at station
- Items can be added to inventory
- Items can be fitted to ship slots
- Fitted items are readable via API
- Save system triggers successfully
- Save data includes fitted items

### Manual Verification Required

The automated portion cannot close/reopen Chrome, so manual verification is needed:

1. **Close Chrome completely** (entire browser)
2. **Reopen Chrome** and load the game
3. **Dock at station** and open ship fitting interface
4. **Check if items persist:**
   - Basic Mining Laser in high slot 0
   - Basic Afterburner in mid slot 0

If items are **NOT** present → **BUG REPRODUCED**  
If items **ARE** present → Bug NOT reproduced

### Evidence Location

- **Evidence file**: `bug_evidence_1763429523598.json`
- **Console logs**: Captured in evidence file (5 entries)
- **Chrome errors**: 5 GCM authentication errors (Chrome internal, unrelated to bug)

**DECISION: execution_complete**
