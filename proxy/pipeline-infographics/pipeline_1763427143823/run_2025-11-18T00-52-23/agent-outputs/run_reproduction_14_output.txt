## Summary

The reproduction script **executed but encountered a framework error** before completing the full test sequence:

### What Worked
✅ Environment setup (HTTP server with no caching)  
✅ Chrome launch via ChromeManager  
✅ WebSocket connection established  
✅ Ship state retrieved successfully  
✅ Nearby station found (Military Station 6)  
✅ Ship teleported near station  
✅ Docking initiated successfully  

### What Failed
❌ **Command failed**: `addItemToInventory` with item ID `mining_laser_i`  
❌ **Error**: "Item not found in content database: mining_laser_i"  
❌ **Game disconnected** before test sequence could complete  

### Root Cause
The test script attempted to add an item with ID `mining_laser_i` to the player inventory, but this item ID does not exist in the game's content database. The error originated in `GameTestingInterface.js:490:19`.

### Evidence Quality
✅ Console logs captured (5 entries, all Chrome GCM errors - unrelated to test)  
✅ Command history captured (6 commands)  
✅ Full command responses with error details  
✅ Proper error stack trace included  

### Next Steps Required
The test script needs to be updated with a **valid item ID** from the content database. The reproduction script cannot proceed to test ship fitting persistence until this issue is resolved.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
