Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of the framework fixes I made:

## Framework Fix Summary

I've successfully fixed the test automation framework by correcting the item IDs used in the reproduction script. The issue was that the test script was using incorrect item IDs that didn't match the ContentManager database.

### Changes Made:

**File: `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`**

1. **Fixed Item IDs** (Lines 104, 115, 128-129, 138, 151, 183-184):
   - Changed `mining_laser_i` → `basic_mining_laser` (correct ID from ContentManager)
   - Changed `afterburner_i` → `basic_afterburner` (correct ID from ContentManager)

2. **Updated Test Descriptions** (Lines 111, 120, 130-131, 147, 160, 221-222):
   - Changed "Mining Laser I" → "Basic Mining Laser"
   - Changed "Afterburner I" → "Basic Afterburner"

3. **Added Dynamic Parameter Filling for Dock Command** (Lines 364-369):
   - Added logic to automatically fill `stationId` parameter from nearest station evidence
   - Ensures the dock command receives the correct station ID

### Root Cause:
The test framework was using legacy item naming conventions (`mining_laser_i`, `afterburner_i`) that don't exist in the current ContentManager database. The actual item IDs are `basic_mining_laser` and `basic_afterburner`.

### Verification:
The ContentManager (`js/systems/ContentManager.js`) contains the following item definitions:
- Line 255: `'basic_mining_laser'` - Standard mining equipment (high slot, tier 1)
- Line 77: `'basic_afterburner'` - Speed boost module (mid slot, tier 1)

These are the correct IDs that match the game's content database and are now properly referenced in the test script.

The test framework is now fixed and should be able to:
1. Successfully add items to inventory
2. Fit items to ship slots
3. Verify items are fitted correctly
4. Trigger a save operation
5. Provide manual verification instructions
