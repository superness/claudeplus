### What Happened:

1. ✅ **Environment setup successful** - HTTP server running with caching disabled
2. ✅ **Reproduction script found** - `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`
3. ✅ **Script executed** - Chrome launched, game loaded
4. ✅ **Commands executed:**
   - Got ship state (position 0,0,0)
   - Found nearby station (Nexus Trade Center at 17.1km)
   - **Attempted to dock** → ❌ Failed (station too far)

5. ❌ **Test incomplete** - Could not proceed to fit items because docking failed

### Root Cause:

The reproduction script has a **navigation gap**:
- Ship spawns at origin (0, 0, 0)
- Nearest station is **17.1km away**
- Dock command requires ship to be **within 10km**
- Script doesn't navigate ship closer to station before docking

### Console Logs Captured:

✅ Console logs successfully captured in evidence file:
- 5 error messages (Chrome GCM authentication - not game-related)
- No game exceptions
- Console log file: `ChromeTest_1763411549485/chrome_debug.log` (28,340 lines)

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
