Perfect! The framework error has been fixed. The issue was that the test infrastructure was calling `ship.physics.position.set()` (THREE.Vector3 API), but the actual position object is a plain JavaScript object `{x, y, z}` without a `.set()` method.

## Summary

**Framework Error Fixed:**
- **File**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js:664`
- **Error**: `TypeError: ship.physics.position.set is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: Test framework assumed `position` was a THREE.Vector3 with `.set()` method, but it's actually a plain object
- **Fix**: Changed position update from `.set(x, y, z)` to direct property assignment: `position.x = x; position.y = y; position.z = z`
- **Additional**: Added defensive code for velocity reset to handle both THREE.Vector3 and plain objects

The test infrastructure is now fixed and should be able to successfully teleport the ship near a station for docking tests.
