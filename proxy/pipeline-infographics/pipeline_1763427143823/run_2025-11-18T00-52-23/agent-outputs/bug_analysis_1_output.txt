  "bugSummary": "Ship fitted items are not persisting across game sessions when browser is closed and reopened",
  "expectedBehavior": "When items are fitted to a ship (Mining Laser I, Afterburner, etc.) and the game is saved, those fitted items should remain in their slots when the game is loaded in a new browser session",
  "actualBehavior": "All fitted items disappear from ship slots when Chrome is completely closed and the game is reopened, even though the items were properly fitted and saved before closing",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship-fitting", "save-load", "localStorage", "inventory"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in Chrome browser",
    "Step 2: Dock at a station",
    "Step 3: Ensure inventory has fittable items (Mining Laser I, Afterburner)",
    "Step 4: Open ship fitting interface",
    "Step 5: Fit items to ship slots (e.g., Mining Laser I to turret slot, Afterburner to mid slot)",
    "Step 6: Verify items appear as fitted in the UI",
    "Step 7: Trigger game save (manual save or wait for autosave)",
    "Step 8: Close Chrome completely (not just tab - close entire browser)",
    "Step 9: Reopen Chrome and load the game",
    "Step 10: Observe that all fitted items are missing from ship slots"

  "hypothesis": "The save/load system is likely not properly serializing the ship's fitted items to localStorage, or the load process is not correctly restoring fitted items from the saved game state. The ShipFittingManager may not be included in the save state, or the restore process may be clearing fitted slots before loading saved data. Need to check: (1) if fitted items are being written to save data, (2) if save data includes ship fitting state, (3) if load process correctly restores fitted items to the ship object"
