## Pipeline Template Created Successfully

I have successfully created the `mining-health-check-v1` pipeline template with the following structure:

### Pipeline Overview
- **ID**: mining-health-check-v1
- **Name**: Mining Health Check Pipeline V1
- **Category**: infrastructure
- **Stages**: 4 total stages
- **File Location**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/mining-health-check-v1.json`

### Pipeline Stages and Decision Routing

**Stage 1: Network Health Check** (`network_monitor` agent)
- **Purpose**: Monitor Bitcoin network connectivity and peer status
- **Decisions**:
  - `healthy` → Routes to **Stage 2** (mining_status_check)
  - `degraded` → Routes to **Stage 3** (run_diagnostics)
  - `disconnected` → Routes to **Stage 4** (emergency_shutdown)

**Stage 2: Mining Status Verification** (`mining_status_checker` agent)
- **Purpose**: Verify mining operations are functioning correctly
- **Input**: network_health_check
- **Decisions**: All terminal (pipeline ends)
  - `mining_operational` → PIPELINE ENDS (all systems healthy)
  - `mining_issues` → PIPELINE ENDS (needs manual review)
  - `mining_stopped` → PIPELINE ENDS (needs manual review)

**Stage 3: Infrastructure Diagnostics** (`diagnostics_agent` agent)
- **Purpose**: Diagnose issues when network is degraded
- **Input**: network_health_check
- **Decisions**: All terminal (pipeline ends)
  - `issues_identified` → PIPELINE ENDS (remediation plan provided)
  - `needs_manual_intervention` → PIPELINE ENDS (human action required)
  - `cannot_diagnose` → PIPELINE ENDS (needs more investigation)

**Stage 4: Emergency Shutdown** (`emergency_shutdown` agent)
- **Purpose**: Safely halt operations on critical network failure
- **Input**: network_health_check
- **Decisions**: All terminal (pipeline ends)
  - `shutdown_complete` → PIPELINE ENDS (clean shutdown)
  - `shutdown_incomplete` → PIPELINE ENDS (manual cleanup needed)
  - `shutdown_aborted` → PIPELINE ENDS (critical conditions)

### Agents Created

I created 3 new agents with comprehensive prompts and proper decision outputs:

1. **mining_status_checker.json** (`/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/mining_status_checker.json`)
   - Verifies mining operations (process status, hashrate, pool connectivity, share submissions)
   - Decisions: `mining_operational`, `mining_issues`, `mining_stopped`

2. **diagnostics_agent.json** (`/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/diagnostics_agent.json`)
   - Performs comprehensive diagnostics (network, resources, configuration, logs)
   - Decisions: `issues_identified`, `needs_manual_intervention`, `cannot_diagnose`

3. **emergency_shutdown.json** (`/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/emergency_shutdown.json`)
   - Executes safe shutdown procedures (mining stop, daemon stop, state preservation)
   - Decisions: `shutdown_complete`, `shutdown_incomplete`, `shutdown_aborted`

The existing `network_monitor` agent was already available with the required decisions (`healthy`, `degraded`, `disconnected`).

### Pipeline Flow Visualization

```
[START] → network_health_check
              ↓
         ┌────┴────┬──────────┐
         ↓         ↓          ↓
    [healthy]  [degraded] [disconnected]
         ↓         ↓          ↓
  mining_status  diagnostics  emergency_shutdown
      check        agent
         ↓         ↓          ↓
      [END]     [END]      [END]
```

All 4 stages are properly connected with decision-based routing. The pipeline template follows the established pattern from existing templates (bug-fix-v1, feature-development-v1) and includes comprehensive metadata for infrastructure monitoring.
