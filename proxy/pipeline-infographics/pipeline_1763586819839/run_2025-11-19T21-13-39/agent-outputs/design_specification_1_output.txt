UNDERSTANDING: User wants a mining infrastructure health check pipeline with 4 stages that monitors network health, checks mining status, runs diagnostics, or triggers emergency shutdown based on network status decisions.

APPROACH: Create a new pipeline template JSON file in the templates/ directory following the existing pipeline structure pattern (similar to bug-fix-v1.json, feature-development-v1.json). The pipeline will have sequential stages with conditional routing based on agent decisions.

STEPS:
1) Read existing pipeline templates to understand the JSON structure: `Read templates/bug-fix-v1.json` and `Read templates/feature-development-v1.json`
2) Check if required agents exist in agents/ directory: `Glob pattern="agents/{network_monitor,mining_status_checker,diagnostics_agent,emergency_shutdown}.json"`
3) Create agents that don't exist yet with appropriate prompts and decision outputs
4) Create new pipeline template file: `Write templates/mining-health-check-v1.json` with structure:
   - Stage 1: network_monitor (decisions: healthy, degraded, disconnected)
   - Stage 2: mining_status_checker (connected to network_monitor's 'healthy' decision)
   - Stage 3: diagnostics_agent (connected to network_monitor's 'degraded' decision)
   - Stage 4: emergency_shutdown (connected to network_monitor's 'disconnected' decision)
5) Define proper stage connections in the JSON structure mapping decision outputs to next stages
6) Set appropriate working directory and initial stage configuration

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will ensure the pipeline template validates against existing structure patterns, includes all required fields (id, name, workingDir, stages, connections, initialStage), and that decision routing is correctly configured with valid agent references. Will verify that each stage has proper id, name, agent, and prompt fields.

EVIDENCE: Will provide the complete JSON structure of the pipeline template showing all 4 stages, their connections, and decision routing logic. Will show that required agents exist or have been created with appropriate decision outputs matching the routing requirements.

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward pipeline template creation task following established patterns in the codebase. The structure is well-documented in existing templates and the routing logic is clearly specified.
