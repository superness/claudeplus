  "bugSummary": "Ship movement completely non-functional - input events received but ships remain stationary",
  "expectedBehavior": "When navigation commands (keyboard, mouse clicks, or tap-to-move inputs) are issued, the ship should update its position/velocity and move visibly on screen according to EVE-style physics",
  "actualBehavior": "Input events are being received and registered, but ships do not move at all. They remain stationary despite navigation commands being issued",

  "hypothesis": "There is a disconnect in the movement pipeline between input handling and physics/position updates. Possible causes: (1) Input handlers are firing but not calling ship movement methods, (2) Ship movement methods are being called but physics engine is not updating velocity/position, (3) Position is updating but not being applied to the Three.js mesh in rendering, (4) A recent change broke the connection between InputManager/MobileInputManager and the ship entity, (5) Physics update loop is not running or delta time is zero, (6) Ship velocity/acceleration calculations are producing zero/NaN values"
