Perfect! The reproduction script is ready to execute. Let me create the final summary.

## Ship Movement Bug Reproduction Script Created

I've created a comprehensive automated reproduction script for the ship movement bug at:
**`/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js`**

### What the Script Tests

The script systematically tests the entire ship movement pipeline:

1. **Input Layer Testing**
   - Verifies automation framework is connected (`listCommands`)
   - Captures baseline ship state (position, velocity)

2. **Throttle Command Testing**
   - Sets throttle to 50% via `setThrottle` command
   - Waits 1 second for physics processing
   - Verifies if velocity changed (ship should accelerate)
   - Checks if position changed

3. **Navigation Target Testing** (Tap-to-Move Simulation)
   - Sets navigation target at (5000, 0, 5000) via `setNavigationTarget` command
   - Waits 3 seconds for ship to engage autopilot
   - Measures distance traveled from initial position
   - Verifies ship has non-zero velocity
   - Confirms ship is moving toward the target

### Bug Detection Logic

The script detects the bug if:
- **Distance moved < 10 meters** after 3+ seconds of navigation
- **Velocity magnitude < 0.1 m/s** despite navigation target being set
- Ship position doesn't change despite throttle being applied

### Command Sequence

```javascript
listCommands → getShipState (baseline) → setThrottle(50%) → wait(1s) → 
getShipState (check velocity) → setThrottle(0%) → setNavigationTarget(5000,0,5000) → 
wait(3s) → getShipState (check movement) → resetGameState
```

### Evidence Output

The script saves detailed evidence to `ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json` containing:
- All commands executed with timestamps
- Initial and final positions
- Velocity changes
- Distance moved calculations
- Bug reproduction status

### How to Execute

```bash
# Ensure http-server is running on port 8080
npm start

# In a new terminal, run the reproduction script
node /mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js
```

The script will:
1. Start WebSocket automation server on port 8765
2. Launch Chrome with the game URL + `?testMode=true`
3. Wait for game to connect
4. Execute the command sequence
5. Report whether the bug was reproduced
6. Save evidence JSON file

### Expected Outcome

If the bug exists, the script will output:
```
❌ BUG REPRODUCED: Ship did not move after setNavigationTarget!
```

And save evidence showing that despite valid commands being issued, the ship position/velocity did not update as expected.

**DECISION: script_ready**
