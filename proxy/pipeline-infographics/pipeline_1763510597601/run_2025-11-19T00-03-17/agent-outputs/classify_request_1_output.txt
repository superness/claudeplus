Looking at this request, I can identify the following:

**Key Indicators:**
- "BUG REPORT" - explicitly stated
- "not completing properly" - broken functionality
- "doesn't mark as complete" - system failure
- "blocking tutorial progression" - critical broken state
- "fix the bug" - explicitly asking for bug fix

**Analysis:**

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** request. The user is reporting that an existing feature (quest objective completion) is not working as intended. The quest system should detect when a player crafts and equips an afterburner, but it's failing to do so, which blocks game progression.

This is NOT:
- **QUICK_CHANGE**: Not a simple parameter adjustment; requires investigation and logic fixes
- **FEATURE_REQUEST**: The quest system exists; it's just broken
- **REFACTOR**: Not about code improvement; about fixing broken functionality
- **QUESTION**: User is reporting a problem, not asking how something works

  "confidence": 0.99,
  "reasoning": "User explicitly reports a bug where quest completion logic fails to detect equipped items. Uses clear bug indicators: 'not completing properly', 'doesn't mark as complete', 'blocking progression', and explicitly asks to 'fix the bug'. This is broken functionality, not a feature request or simple change.",

    "originalRequest": "BUG REPORT: The first mission has a quest objective to craft and equip an item, but it's not completing properly. The player successfully crafts an afterburner and equips it to their ship, but the quest objective doesn't mark as complete. This is blocking tutorial progression. Investigate the quest completion logic for the craft-and-fit objective, identify why it's not detecting the equipped afterburner, and fix the bug so the quest progresses correctly when the player equips the crafted item.",

DECISION: BUG_FIX
