UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a new pipeline JSON file called "pool-feature-development.json" based on specifications from section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline is for developing CoiniumServ features with mining cycle validation and has 7 defined stages with specific agent assignments.

APPROACH: I will first read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's requirements, then examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the correct structure and format, and finally create a detailed plan for constructing the pool-feature-development.json file with all required stages and configurations.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 3.3, to understand the full pipeline requirements, expected inputs/outputs, and any additional metadata
2) Use Glob tool with pattern "templates/*.json" to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure (fields like name, description, stages, agent assignments, transitions, etc.)
4) Document the exact JSON schema requirements including:
   - Top-level pipeline metadata (name, description, version, etc.)
   - Stage structure (name, agent, inputs, outputs, validation rules)
   - Transition/flow logic between stages
   - Any error handling or conditional paths
5) Map the 7 specified stages to the JSON schema:
   - define_feature → task_planner
   - plan_implementation → task_planner
   - implement_feature → task_executor
   - integration_test → cycle_integration_tester
   - validate_stratum → stratum_monitor
   - performance_test → performance_analyzer
   - feature_validation_complete → END
6) Plan the complete JSON structure including all required fields, proper stage ordering, input/output specifications for each stage, and transition logic
7) Plan validation checks to ensure the JSON is well-formed and matches the schema

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will verify that:
- The pipeline JSON follows the exact schema used by existing pipelines in the templates directory
- All 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent assignments
- Stage transitions flow correctly from define_feature through to END
- The JSON is syntactically valid and properly formatted
- Required metadata fields match section 3.3 specifications
- Input/output specifications for each stage are compatible with subsequent stages
- Error handling paths are considered if specified in the documentation

EVIDENCE: Will collect and reference:
- The exact content of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Examples of existing pipeline JSON structures from the templates directory
- The complete JSON schema specification showing all required and optional fields
- A mapping table showing how each of the 7 stages maps to the JSON structure
- The final planned JSON structure before writing to file

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While the stage requirements are clearly defined, I need to verify the exact JSON schema format from existing templates and ensure section 3.3 contains all necessary details for pipeline configuration (timeouts, retry logic, validation criteria, etc.). The confidence will increase to High once I've examined the reference materials.
