## Pipeline Creation Complete

I have successfully created the **pool-feature-development.json** pipeline based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md.

### Pipeline Summary

**File Location**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json` (24KB)

**Purpose**: Develop new CoiniumServ features with comprehensive mining cycle validation

### 7 Pipeline Stages

1. **define_feature** → `task_planner`
   - Document feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and CoiniumServ integration points
   - Analyze existing architecture and identify affected modules
   - Generate feature specification document

2. **plan_implementation** → `task_planner`
   - Create detailed implementation plan with code structure
   - Design mining cycle integration strategy
   - Plan stratum/RPC/database modifications

3. **implement_feature** → `task_executor`
   - Implement feature in CoiniumServ codebase
   - Build and verify compilation
   - Document code changes

4. **integration_test** → `cycle_integration_tester`
   - Test with real mining infrastructure (daemon → pool → miner → shares → blocks)
   - Validate feature behavior against acceptance criteria
   - Capture comprehensive logs

5. **validate_stratum** → `stratum_monitor`
   - Ensure stratum protocol compliance
   - Monitor job delivery and share submission
   - Verify backward compatibility

6. **performance_test** → `performance_analyzer`
   - Establish performance baseline
   - Measure feature impact on CPU, memory, throughput
   - Compare against regression thresholds

7. **feature_validation_complete** → END
   - Consolidate all test results
   - Generate comprehensive feature report
   - Mark feature as validated

### Key Features

- **Test-Driven Development**: Feature defined and planned before implementation
- **Real Mining Validation**: Integration with actual Bitcoin daemon (regtest), pool server, and miners
- **Protocol Compliance**: Stratum protocol validation and backward compatibility checks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Baseline comparison with regression detection
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed documentation at each stage
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with intelligent stage transitions on failure
- **Artifact Management**: Preserves all test artifacts, logs, and reports

### Configuration Highlights

- Network: Bitcoin regtest mode
- RPC Port: 18443 (daemon)
- Stratum Port: 3333 (pool)
- Minimal Test Difficulty: 0.0001
- Performance Thresholds: ≤10% CPU, ≤15% memory increase
- Total Timeout: 2 hours
- Multi-miner Load Testing: 10 concurrent miners

The pipeline is ready for use in developing and validating CoiniumServ pool features with complete mining cycle integration testing.
