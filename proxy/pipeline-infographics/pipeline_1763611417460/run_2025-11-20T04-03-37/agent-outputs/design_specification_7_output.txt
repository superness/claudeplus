UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a `pool-feature-development.json` pipeline file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline is for developing new CoiniumServ features with mining cycle validation and has 7 defined stages progressing from feature definition through validation.

APPROACH: First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's specifications and requirements. Then analyze existing pipeline JSON files in the /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory to understand the correct JSON structure and format. Finally, design the complete pipeline JSON structure that implements the 7 stages with appropriate routing to task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, and performance_analyzer.

STEPS:
1) Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to examine section 3.3 specifications
2) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/
3) Read 2-3 example pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure
4) Design the pipeline JSON with:
   - Stage 1: define_feature → routes to task_planner
   - Stage 2: plan_implementation → routes to task_planner
   - Stage 3: implement_feature → routes to task_executor
   - Stage 4: integration_test → routes to cycle_integration_tester
   - Stage 5: validate_stratum → routes to stratum_monitor
   - Stage 6: performance_test → routes to performance_analyzer
   - Stage 7: feature_validation_complete → END condition
5) Include proper metadata, stage descriptions, and routing logic based on observed patterns
6) Specify the exact JSON structure with all required fields per stage

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: The plan will ensure the pipeline handles:
- Proper sequential stage progression (1→2→3→4→5→6→7)
- Correct routing to each specialized agent type
- End condition handling at feature_validation_complete
- Integration with mining cycle validation context
- Error handling and stage transition logic
- Compatibility with CoiniumServ feature development workflow

EVIDENCE: Will provide:
- Contents of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Example pipeline JSON structure from existing templates
- Complete designed JSON schema showing all 7 stages with routing
- Verification that stage names, routing targets, and flow match requirements

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The stage names and routing are explicitly provided, but the exact JSON schema structure depends on reading the specification document and existing templates. The pipeline structure is straightforward, but proper implementation requires understanding the existing pipeline format conventions and section 3.3 requirements.
