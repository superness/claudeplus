UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-feature-development pipeline JSON configuration file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This pipeline will automate the development and validation of new CoiniumServ features with mining cycle testing through 7 defined stages.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications
2. Analyze the required pipeline structure and stage configurations
3. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON schema
4. Design the JSON structure with all 7 stages and their transitions
5. Map each stage to its appropriate agent/component (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer)
6. Define the complete pipeline configuration with proper stage ordering and validation points

STEPS:
1. Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 3.3
2. Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline templates: "templates/*.json" in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/
3. Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure
4. Design the pipeline JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages with their properties
   - Transition rules between stages (define_feature → task_planner → plan_implementation, etc.)
   - Agent/component mappings for each stage
   - Input/output parameters for each stage
   - Validation criteria and success conditions
5. Plan the specific configuration for each stage:
   - define_feature: Initial feature specification stage
   - plan_implementation: Implementation planning with task_planner
   - implement_feature: Code implementation with task_executor
   - integration_test: Mining cycle integration testing
   - validate_stratum: Stratum protocol validation
   - performance_test: Performance analysis
   - feature_validation_complete: Terminal success stage
6. Verify the output path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists using Bash ls command
7. Document the JSON structure that will be written to pool-feature-development.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify section 3.3 exists and contains pool-feature-development pipeline specifications
- Check if the templates directory exists and is writable
- Ensure the JSON schema matches existing pipeline templates for consistency
- Validate that all 7 stages are properly defined with correct transitions
- Confirm agent mappings (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer) are correctly assigned
- Verify the pipeline flow: define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- List of existing pipeline templates and their structure
- Sample pipeline JSON schema from existing templates
- Verification that /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory exists
- Complete JSON structure for pool-feature-development.json with all 7 stages properly configured
- Stage transition mapping showing the complete flow from define_feature to END

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires reading the specification document to understand exact requirements for section 3.3, examining existing pipeline structures for schema consistency, and creating a properly structured JSON configuration. Confidence is not "High" because I need to verify the exact specifications in section 3.3 and match the existing template schema, but the task itself is well-defined with clear stages and transitions.
