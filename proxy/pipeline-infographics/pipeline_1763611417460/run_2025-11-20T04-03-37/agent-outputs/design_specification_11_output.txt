UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-feature-development pipeline JSON file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should have 7 stages for developing CoiniumServ features with mining cycle validation, and should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's requirements and context
2. Analyze the pipeline stages and their connections to understand the workflow
3. Determine the correct JSON structure based on any existing pipeline templates in the claudeplus/templates directory
4. Design the JSON schema with proper stage definitions, transitions, and agent assignments
5. Plan the file write operation to the specified location

STEPS:
1) Use Glob tool to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository (pattern: "**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md")
2) Use Read tool to read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file, specifically focusing on section 3.3
3) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ (pattern: "*.json")
4) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline templates to understand the JSON structure/schema
5) Design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - 7 stages as specified: define_feature, plan_implementation, implement_feature, integration_test, validate_stratum, performance_test, feature_validation_complete
   - Agent assignments: task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer
   - Transitions between stages
   - Any required configuration parameters per stage
6) Use Bash tool to verify the target directory exists: ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/
7) Plan to use Write tool to write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and section 3.3 is accessible
- Ensure the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates for consistency
- Validate that all 7 stages are correctly defined with proper agent assignments
- Confirm the stage transitions flow correctly (define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END)
- Check that the target directory /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists before writing
- Ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Verify all agent types mentioned (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer) are correctly assigned

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Example JSON structure from existing pipeline templates
- Directory listing showing /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists
- The complete designed JSON structure for pool-feature-development.json
- Confirmation that all 7 stages and their transitions match the specification
- Mapping of each stage to its designated agent

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task is straightforward (create a JSON file with specified stages), but confidence depends on finding and understanding section 3.3 of the plan document and matching the existing pipeline JSON schema. If the documentation is clear and existing templates provide good examples, confidence will be high. If section 3.3 is missing or existing templates don't exist, additional design decisions will be needed.
