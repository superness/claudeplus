UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a JSON pipeline configuration file for the "pool-feature-development" pipeline based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This pipeline orchestrates the development and validation of new CoiniumServ mining pool features through 7 stages, each delegating to specific agent types (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer).

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's specifications for the pool-feature-development pipeline
2. Analyze the stage flow and requirements for each stage
3. Determine the proper JSON structure based on existing pipeline templates in the claudeplus/templates directory
4. Design the complete pipeline JSON with all 7 stages, including proper agent routing, input/output parameters, and stage transitions
5. Specify the file write location as /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json

STEPS:
1. Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to extract section 3.3 specifications using: `Read` tool with file path to find the document
2. Search for existing pipeline JSON templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ using: `Glob` tool with pattern "*.json" to understand the expected JSON schema
3. Read 1-2 example pipeline files using: `Read` tool to understand the structure, required fields, and formatting conventions
4. Design the JSON structure including:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages (define_feature, plan_implementation, implement_feature, integration_test, validate_stratum, performance_test, feature_validation_complete)
   - Agent type mappings (task_planner, task_executor, cycle_integration_tester, stratum_monitor, performance_analyzer)
   - Input/output parameters for each stage
   - Transition rules between stages
   - Error handling and validation criteria
5. Format the complete JSON with proper indentation and validation
6. Write the final JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json using: `Write` tool

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify the pipeline JSON follows the same schema/structure as existing pipeline templates
- Ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent type assignments
- Validate that stage transitions flow correctly from define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete → END
- Confirm each stage has appropriate input/output parameter definitions for data flow between stages
- Check that CoiniumServ-specific requirements (mining cycle validation, stratum protocol, performance metrics) are properly captured
- Ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted

EVIDENCE:
- Content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3 showing the pipeline requirements
- Example pipeline JSON files showing the expected schema and structure
- The complete generated pool-feature-development.json file with all stages properly configured
- Verification that the file is written to the correct location: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a structured JSON creation task based on documented specifications. The main uncertainty is whether MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and contains section 3.3, and what the exact schema requirements are from existing pipeline templates. Once these documents are read, the task becomes straightforward JSON authoring following established patterns.
