ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. The plan demonstrates clear understanding of the task: create a pipeline JSON file with 7 specific stages routing to 5 different agent types
2. Logical step-by-step approach: read specification → examine existing templates → understand schema → design new pipeline
3. All 7 stages are explicitly identified with their routing targets
4. The approach correctly prioritizes understanding existing patterns before creating new content

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Missing File Write Step**: The plan describes designing the JSON structure but never explicitly states it will WRITE the file to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`. Step 6 says "Specify the exact JSON structure" but doesn't say "Write the JSON to the target path." This is a fundamental omission.

2. **Vague Evidence Collection**: 
   - "Will provide contents of section 3.3" - but doesn't specify HOW this proves task completion
   - "Complete designed JSON schema" - where? In memory? Written to file?
   - No mention of verifying the file exists at the target path after creation

3. **No Concrete Verification Plan**: The plan should explicitly state:
   - "Read the created file from `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`"
   - "Verify it contains all 7 stages with correct routing"
   - "Validate JSON syntax is correct"
   - "Confirm file permissions and location"

4. **Confidence Justification Mismatch**: "Medium-High" confidence seems appropriate for the design phase, but there's no acknowledgment that the actual file creation step might have issues (directory permissions, JSON formatting errors, etc.)

5. **Incomplete TEST_CONSIDERATIONS**: Lists what the pipeline should handle (sequential progression, routing, error handling) but doesn't explain how the PLAN will verify these aspects work correctly

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence is conceptual rather than concrete:
- "Contents of section 3.3" - informational, not proof of completion
- "Example pipeline JSON structure" - reference material, not deliverable
- "Complete designed JSON schema showing all 7 stages" - design artifact, but no proof it was written to the correct file path
- "Verification that stage names... match requirements" - mentions verification but doesn't specify the verification METHOD

**What's missing for STRONG evidence:**
- File system proof: Successful read of `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json`
- Content proof: Display of the actual JSON showing all 7 stages
- Validation proof: Confirmation that JSON is valid and matches the specification
- Location proof: Verification the file exists at the exact requested path

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning**: 
While the plan shows good understanding of the pipeline requirements and a logical approach to gathering information, it fails the fundamental requirement of providing concrete, verifiable proof of task completion. The plan describes "designing" but never explicitly commits to "writing the file to the target path" and "verifying it exists." A complete plan must include:
1. Explicit file write step with exact path
2. Post-write verification (read the file back)
3. Content validation against requirements
4. Concrete evidence that can be independently verified

The plan needs revision to add these critical verification steps.

DECISION: REJECTED
