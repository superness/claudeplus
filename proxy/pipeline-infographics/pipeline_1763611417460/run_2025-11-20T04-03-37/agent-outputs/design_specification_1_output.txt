UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pipeline JSON file for pool feature development that follows the stages outlined in section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should include 7 stages with specific transitions and agent assignments as specified.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3's requirements and context
2. Examine any existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the expected JSON structure and format
3. Design the JSON structure based on the stages and transitions provided
4. Create a comprehensive pipeline definition that includes all 7 stages with proper agent assignments, transitions, and any necessary metadata

STEPS:
1) Read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md using Read tool to understand section 3.3 requirements fully
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ directory
3) Read 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the expected schema/structure
4) Design the complete pool-feature-development.json structure including:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - All 7 stages with proper configuration:
     * define_feature (task_planner agent)
     * plan_implementation (task_planner agent)
     * implement_feature (task_executor agent)
     * integration_test (cycle_integration_tester agent)
     * validate_stratum (stratum_monitor agent)
     * performance_test (performance_analyzer agent)
     * feature_validation_complete (END state)
   - Transitions between stages
   - Any required inputs/outputs per stage
   - Error handling paths if present in other pipelines
5) Validate the JSON structure against examples to ensure consistency
6) Write the complete pipeline JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-feature-development.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates in the directory
- Will ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct agent assignments
- Will validate that stage transitions follow the specified flow: define_feature → plan_implementation → implement_feature → integration_test → validate_stratum → performance_test → feature_validation_complete
- Will check that the END state is properly configured
- Will ensure JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Will verify the file is written to the correct path

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the content of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will display examples of existing pipeline JSON structures
- Will provide the complete generated pool-feature-development.json content
- Will confirm successful file write to the target location
- Will validate JSON syntax is correct

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task requirements are clearly specified with exact stage names and agent assignments. However, confidence is not absolute because I need to see the actual documentation and existing pipeline structure to ensure the JSON format matches the expected schema. The actual structure, metadata fields, and transition syntax will depend on what's defined in existing templates.

DECISION: design_complete
