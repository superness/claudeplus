Now I have all the information needed to complete my review. Let me assess the extracted requirements against the original design documents.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

**Zone/World Structure** - VERIFIED
- Zone types (STARTING_ZONE, HUB_CITY, ADVENTURE_ZONE, DUNGEON, RAID, PVP_ARENA, FACTION_WAR) correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:10-17`
- Faction-specific zone names (Shrine World, Sept Colony, Rok Crash Site, etc.) correctly quoted from `systems-integration.md:483-491`

**Map Bounds & Coordinate System** - VERIFIED
- `ZoneBounds` interface (minX, minY, maxX, maxY) correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:77-82`
- `WorldPosition` interface (x, y, z) correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:84-88`
- Map bounds example (0,0 to 2000,2000) correctly extracted from `api-specification.md:1942-1944`

**Zone Features** - VERIFIED
- Zone features enum (AUCTION_HOUSE, GUILD_HALL, VENDORS, BANK, CRAFTING_STATION, WAYPOINT, QUEST_BOARD) correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:90-97`

**Waypoint System** - VERIFIED
- Waypoint interface correctly quoted from `world.model.ts:103-108`
- Exploration XP values for waypoint unlock (50 XP) and discovery correctly quoted from `progression-design.md:92-95`

**Points of Interest** - VERIFIED
- POI types (SERVICE, QUEST_GIVER, VENDOR, DUNGEON_ENTRANCE, LANDMARK) correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:121-126`
- POI interface correctly quoted from `world.model.ts:128-136`

**Difficulty System** - VERIFIED
- Difficulty modifiers table correctly quoted from `world.model.ts:33-39`
- All five difficulty levels (STORY, NORMAL, HARD, VETERAN, NIGHTMARE) captured

**Instance Constants** - VERIFIED
- DEFAULT_INSTANCE_DURATION_HOURS = 4, MAX_DUNGEON_PLAYERS = 4, MAX_RAID_PLAYERS = 8 correctly extracted from `world.model.ts:347-350`

**Existing Client Implementation** - VERIFIED
- Current GameScene.js values correctly identified:
  - Player sprite: 32x48 pixels, gold color (#d4af37) from line 20
  - Grid size: 40px tiles from lines 57, 64
  - Game canvas: 800x600 pixels (world bounds from lines 57-66)
  - Background: #0d1117 from line 14
  - Movement speed: 200px/s from line 72

**Faction Aesthetic Requirements** - VERIFIED
- Imperial, Tau, and Ork gameplay identities correctly summarized from `systems-integration.md:431-478`
- Combat styles and lore feel captured for all three factions

### Items Correctly Not Included (Would Be Out of Scope)
- No invented requirements detected
- No generic placeholders substituted for specific designs
- No oversimplification of designed mechanics

### Ready for Implementation
The requirements capture the design intent accurately. The extraction correctly identifies:
1. Specific numeric values (40px tiles, 200px/s speed, 0,0-2000,2000 bounds)
2. Faction-specific zone names and aesthetics
3. Data structures from the TypeScript models
4. Current client implementation baseline
5. All relevant interfaces for world/zone management

The implementation checklist is reasonable and maps to the extracted specifications.
