## Summary

Created a Phaser.js game client scaffold with:

**Files Created:**
- `client/index.html` - HTML entry point with dark Warhammer theme styling, loads Phaser 3.60 from CDN
- `client/js/game.js` - Phaser config (800x600, arcade physics, no gravity)
- `client/js/scenes/BootScene.js` - Loading screen with progress bar and "Game Loading..." text
- `client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Main gameplay with:
  - Grid-based floor for visual reference
  - Player rectangle (placeholder for sprite)
  - WASD + Arrow key movement (200px/s, normalized diagonals)
  - World bounds collision
  - FPS and position debug display
- `client/package.json` - Dev server setup with `http-server`

**To Run:**
```bash
cd client && npm start
# Opens at http://localhost:8080
```

The client is ready for feature development (player sprites, combat, skills, etc.).
