## Current State

- **Client exists**: No - No game client found. No index.html, game.js, or Phaser references exist in the project. The only HTML files found are in node_modules.
- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation exists in `design-docs/`:
  - `combat-design.md` - Detailed combat mechanics, damage types, skill system
  - `progression-design.md` - Leveling, XP curves, horizontal progression
  - `balance-analysis.md`
  - `balance-audit.md`
  - `engagement-analysis.md`
  - `emergence-analysis.md`
  - `systems-integration.md`
  - `player-experience.md`
  - `data-model.md`
  - `api-specification.md`
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express backend exists with:
  - Models: Character, Combat, Skill, Item, Quest, Economy, Social, World, Guild
  - Services: Auth, Character, Combat, Economy, Social, World, Validation
  - APIs: Auth, Character, Combat, Quest, Inventory, Economy, Social, World
  - WebSocket handler for combat
  - PostgreSQL database with migrations and seeds
  - Full test suite
- **Can run**: Yes - Backend can run with `npm run dev`, tests with `npm test`

## Recommendation

The project has a complete backend server but **no game client whatsoever**. We need to set up a game client from scratch. Given the design docs specify real-time movement, skill bars, and Guild Wars 1-style gameplay, a web-based client using Phaser.js would be ideal. We need to:

1. Create a `client/` directory structure
2. Set up Phaser.js game framework
3. Create basic HTML/CSS entry point
4. Build scenes (boot, login, character select, game world)
5. Implement player movement first, then combat
