## Next Feature: Basic map/world

### Already Implemented
- **Player character** ✅ - Rectangle sprite (placeholder) at 32x48 pixels in gold color (#d4af37)
- **WASD/Arrow key movement** ✅ - 200px/s speed with normalized diagonals
- **World bounds collision** ✅ - Player collides with screen edges
- **Basic grid floor** ✅ - Visual 40px grid pattern for reference
- **Physics** ✅ - Arcade physics enabled with no gravity
- **Debug display** ✅ - FPS and position text

### Why This Feature
Feature #1 (Player character that moves with WASD/arrows) is already complete. The scaffold includes a movable player rectangle with full keyboard controls and physics. The next priority item is #2: Basic map/world - creating a proper tile-based environment instead of just a simple grid overlay. This will provide actual game world structure for subsequent features like collision, enemy spawning, and combat.
