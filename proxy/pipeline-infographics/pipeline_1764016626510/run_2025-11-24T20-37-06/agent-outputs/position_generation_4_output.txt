The document is now approximately 4,620 lines and provides implementation-level detail for every aspect of Bitcoin mining pool development.

POSITION_1: Bitcoin's SHA256 double-hashing approach represents a conservative security design that prioritizes collision resistance over computational efficiency, making it the optimal choice for proof-of-work consensus despite emerging quantum threats.
RATIONALE_1: This is arguable because some argue SHA3 or other algorithms would be better, others debate whether double-hashing adds meaningful security, and the quantum resistance question remains contested.

POSITION_2: The Stratum v1 protocol's centralized work distribution model fundamentally undermines Bitcoin's decentralization goals, yet pool operators have resisted adopting Stratum v2 due to the economic advantages of transaction selection control.
RATIONALE_2: This creates tension between ideological Bitcoin principles and practical pool economics, with reasonable arguments on both sides about whether the tradeoff is acceptable.

POSITION_3: The single-transaction merkle root edge case (identity function vs hashing) reveals a fundamental design inconsistency in Bitcoin's protocol that should have been standardized differently.
RATIONALE_3: Some argue the identity case is elegant and correct, others see it as a source of implementation bugs that could have been avoided with consistent hashing.

POSITION_4: ASIC mining's evolution toward sub-3nm fabrication and specialized silicon represents an irreversible centralization of Bitcoin's mining infrastructure that contradicts Satoshi's "one CPU, one vote" vision.
RATIONALE_4: Proponents argue ASICs provide better security through higher hashrate, while critics contend they create barriers to entry that concentrate power.

POSITION_5: The getblocktemplate/Stratum byte-order conventions (display vs internal, chunk-reversed prev_hash) constitute technical debt that causes more implementation bugs than any other aspect of the Bitcoin mining protocol.
RATIONALE_5: Some argue the conventions are historically justified and well-documented now, others contend they should be deprecated in favor of consistent ordering.
