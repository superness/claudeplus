ASSESSMENT: This is an exceptionally thorough and well-structured plan for building the bitcoin_daemon_manager agent. Let me evaluate it against strict criteria:

**Strengths:**
1. **Crystal Clear Understanding**: The plan demonstrates comprehensive understanding of requirements, explicitly mapping section 2.1 requirements to agent capabilities (installation, configuration, lifecycle management, RPC operations, block generation, wallet management)

2. **Logical Step-by-Step Approach**: 
   - Step 1-2: Research phase (read requirements, analyze existing patterns)
   - Step 3: Critical decision on format consistency
   - Step 4-8: Systematic design of all agent components
   - Step 9-10: Implementation and validation
   
   The flow is logical and each step builds on previous ones.

3. **Concrete Evidence Collection**: The EVIDENCE section specifies exactly what will prove completion:
   - Complete JSON file content
   - Capability-to-requirement mappings
   - Decision output mappings to all 4 required decisions
   - ValidationCriteria alignment with section 2.1
   - SystemPrompt coverage of each capability with specific examples
   - JSON syntax validation
   - Format consistency verification

4. **High Confidence with Strong Justification**: 
   - Explicit requirements in section 2.1
   - Multiple existing agent examples as templates
   - Well-documented Bitcoin RPC interface
   - Deterministic regtest operations
   - Clear file path and permissions
   - Identified and mitigated potential challenges

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The plan addresses all requirements:
   - ✓ Install/verify bitcoind
   - ✓ Generate regtest configuration
   - ✓ Start/stop daemon
   - ✓ Query status (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)
   - ✓ Generate blocks (generatetoaddress)
   - ✓ Create/fund wallets
   - ✓ All 4 decision outputs
   - ✓ Target file path specified

6. **Test Considerations**: Extremely thorough with 8 distinct test scenarios covering cold start, RPC connectivity, block generation, wallet lifecycle, errors, shutdown, integration, and edge cases.

**Potential Concerns:**
1. The plan references reading section 2.1 "lines 115-138" but doesn't show the actual content - however, this is acceptable as Step 1 will verify this
2. Format decision between SuperCoinServ vs claudeplus - but this is explicitly addressed and resolved in Step 3
3. No mention of actually testing the generated JSON - but the validation criteria and evidence collection should suffice for design approval

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong**

The evidence specification is concrete and verifiable:
- File content can be read and inspected
- Mappings can be traced and verified
- JSON validation is objective
- SystemPrompt sections can be checked against requirements checklist
- Format consistency can be compared with existing agents

Each evidence item provides objective, measurable proof that the agent meets its requirements.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [x] Shows clear understanding of user request
- [x] Has logical, sequential approach
- [x] Specifies concrete, verifiable evidence
- [x] High confidence with solid reasoning
- [x] Not vague or unclear
- [x] Includes specific evidence collection steps
- [x] Confidence justified by reasoning
- [x] Can provide concrete proof of completion

The plan meets all strict criteria for approval. It's comprehensive, well-reasoned, and will produce verifiable evidence of successful completion. The systematic approach ensures nothing is missed, and the evidence collection will prove the agent satisfies all requirements from section 2.1.

DECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)
