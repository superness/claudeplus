Perfect! Now I have enough information to analyze the bug. Let me look at the combat log more carefully to see the pattern:

Based on my analysis of the codebase and the bug report, I can now provide a comprehensive analysis.

---

**Bug Summary**: Enemy attack executes multiple times per attack cooldown cycle, dealing damage 80+ times from a single attack decision

**Expected Behavior**: When an enemy's attack cooldown expires (every 5 seconds), the enemy should make ONE attack decision, dealing damage ONCE to the target

**Actual Behavior**: When an enemy attacks, the same attack decision is executed repeatedly every frame instead of once per cooldown cycle, resulting in 80+ damage hits in rapid succession (visible in combat log as "Cultist's Attack hits for 1" repeated ~80 times)

**Affected Systems**: 
- Client-side Enemy AI (EnemyAI.ts)
- Entity Manager update loop (EntityManager.ts)
- Combat damage processing (CombatManager.ts)
- Combat event logging/UI feedback

**Severity**: HIGH

This is a critical gameplay bug that makes combat unplayable. The player takes 80x the intended damage per enemy attack cycle, making enemies instantly lethal. While the DAMAGE_SCALE constant (0.01) reduces per-hit damage to ~1, the rapid-fire execution still deals 80+ damage total instead of the intended ~5 damage per 5-second attack.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start game and enter combat zone (Damocles Gulf Sector)
2. Engage any enemy (e.g., Cultist)
3. Wait for enemy to enter attack range
4. Observe combat log showing 80+ consecutive identical damage events from single enemy
5. Notice player health drops rapidly from accumulated hits

**Likely Source Files**: 
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/game/entities/EntityManager.ts:503-521` - `executeEnemyAIDecision` method
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/game/entities/EnemyAI.ts:117-138` - AI update loop and decision caching
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/combat/CombatManager.ts:1196-1268` - `handleEnemyAttack` method

**Initial Hypothesis**: 

The bug is caused by a logic error in how AI decisions are cached and executed in `EntityManager.ts`. Here's the issue:

1. **EnemyAI.ts:136** - When `makeDecision()` is called, it creates an attack decision and stores it in `this.currentDecision`
2. **EnemyAI.ts:130** - On subsequent frames before the next AI tick (0.5 seconds), `update()` returns the cached `this.currentDecision` instead of `null`
3. **EntityManager.ts:569-570** - The EntityManager calls `enemy.updateAI()` **every frame** and executes whatever decision is returned
4. **EntityManager.ts:503-521** - `executeEnemyAIDecision()` is called every frame with the cached ATTACK decision
5. **EntityManager.ts:513-520** - On each execution, it fires the `onEnemyAttack` callback, which processes the full damage

**Root Cause**: The AI returns a cached attack decision every frame for 0.5 seconds (the AI_TICK_RATE), so at 60 FPS, the same attack executes ~30 times. At 144 FPS or with variable frame timing, this could easily be 80+ executions. The attack cooldown (5 seconds) prevents NEW attack decisions, but doesn't prevent the SAME attack decision from being executed repeatedly.

**Expected Fix**: The `executeEnemyAIDecision` should only execute attack actions ONCE per decision, or the EnemyAI should clear attack decisions after the first frame. The current pattern works for MOVE/IDLE actions (which need continuous execution) but breaks for one-shot actions like ATTACK.
