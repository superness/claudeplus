Perfect! The fix has been implemented. Let me summarize what was done:

---

**Changes Made**:

**File: `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/game/entities/EnemyAI.ts:341-346`**
- Added `clearCurrentDecision()` method that sets `this.currentDecision = null`
- This method allows external code to clear cached AI decisions

**File: `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/game/entities/EntityManager.ts:522-523`**
- Added call to `enemy.getAI().clearCurrentDecision()` after executing an ATTACK action
- This ensures the attack decision is cleared immediately after execution, preventing re-execution in subsequent frames

---

**Why This Fixes It**:

The root cause was that the EnemyAI caches decisions every 0.5 seconds and returns the cached decision on every frame in between AI ticks (EnemyAI.ts:129-130). This is fine for continuous actions like MOVE or IDLE, but catastrophic for one-shot actions like ATTACK.

At 60 FPS, this meant an ATTACK decision would execute ~30 times (once per frame) during the 0.5 second window, causing the "100 hits at once" bug.

The fix:
1. After executing an ATTACK action in `EntityManager.executeEnemyAIDecision()`, we now immediately clear the cached decision
2. On the next frame, `EnemyAI.update()` returns `null` (the cleared decision) instead of the cached ATTACK
3. The enemy continues returning `null` until the next AI tick (0.5 seconds later), when a new decision is made
4. MOVE, IDLE, and FLEE actions are unaffected - they remain cached as intended for smooth continuous behavior

---

**Testing Suggestion**:

1. Start the game and spawn enemies near the player
2. Wait for enemies to attack
3. Verify that each enemy attack deals damage only ONCE, not 30-100 times
4. Check the combat log - should see one "[Combat] Cultist's Attack hits for X" message per attack, not dozens
5. Verify that enemy movement and idle behavior still work smoothly (they should, since only ATTACK decisions are cleared)
6. Test with different enemy types (melee and ranged) to ensure the fix works universally
7. Monitor frame rate and attack cooldown timing to ensure the 5-second cooldown still functions correctly

DECISION: fix_implemented
