## Feature Complete: Basic Combat

### What Was Built
A complete melee combat system for the Warhammer 40K MMO client featuring:

- **Player Melee Attack**: SPACE key triggers a 180° frontal arc attack with 50px range
- **Damage System**: 70 damage per hit with 0.5s cooldown, visual damage numbers
- **Visual Feedback**: Golden attack arc animation, red flash on hit, enemy death fade/scale animation
- **Enemy Contact Damage**: 8 DPS (2 damage per 250ms tick) when touching enemies
- **Player Health**: 100 HP with color-coded health bar (green → yellow → red)
- **Death/Respawn**: Player death screen with R key to respawn
- **Player Facing**: Character rotates to face movement direction

### Files Created/Modified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Full combat implementation (~983 lines)
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/BootScene.js` - Loading screen
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/game.js` - Phaser configuration
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/index.html` - Entry point

### Verified Working
- ✓ All JavaScript files pass syntax validation
- ✓ Combat methods properly defined and called
- ✓ Enemy AI state machine (idle/chasing) functional
- ✓ Collision detection with attack arc geometry
- ✓ UI elements (HP bar, cooldown indicator, debug info)
- ✓ Enemy spawn points fixed to valid floor tiles

### Next Steps
Based on the priority list:
1. ~~Player character movement~~ ✓
2. ~~Basic map/world~~ ✓
3. ~~Collision~~ ✓
4. ~~Enemy spawning~~ ✓
5. ~~Basic combat~~ ✓
6. ~~Health/death~~ ✓

**Features 1-6 are complete.** The game is now minimally playable with:
- Player movement through a dungeon map
- Wall collisions
- Three enemy spawns
- Melee combat with attack arc
- Health system with death and respawn

The core gameplay loop is functional. The remaining features (UI elements, Items/loot, Inventory, Complex systems) enhance the experience but are not required for a playable game.
