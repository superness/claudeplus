## Feature Complete: Enemy Spawning

### What Was Built
A complete enemy spawning system with:
- 8 tutorial enemies spawning in two chambers (5 in eastern chamber, 3 in southern chamber)
- Enemy AI with idle/chasing behavior states
- State machine: enemies patrol idle, chase player when within 200px, return to idle when player is 400px+ away
- Visual representation with red circular sprites (16px radius)
- Physics-enabled collision with walls
- Proper spawn point placement verified on floor tiles (not walls)

### Files Created/Modified
1. `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Main gameplay scene with enemy spawning, AI behavior, and fixed spawn coordinates

### Verified Working
- All 3 JavaScript files pass syntax validation
- Enemy spawn points correctly placed on floor tiles:
  - Eastern chamber: (24, 8), (26, 10), (22, 12), (25, 6), (23, 11)
  - Southern chamber: (6, 23), (14, 24), (10, 26)
- Enemy AI state machine logic verified correct
- Wall collisions properly configured for enemies

### Next Steps
Looking at the priority list:
1. ✅ Player character movement - Complete
2. ✅ Basic map/world - Complete (tutorial zone with rooms and corridors)
3. ✅ Collision - Complete (player and enemy wall collisions)
4. ✅ Enemy spawning - Complete (just verified)
5. ⬜ Basic combat - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
6. ⬜ Health/death - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

The game has movement, maps, collision, and enemies, but **no combat system yet**. Enemies can chase the player, but there's no way to fight back or take damage. To make the game "playable" in the traditional sense, we need at least basic combat and health/death mechanics.
