Everything looks correct. The implementation is complete.

## Implemented
- **Enemy Spawning System**: 8 Gretchin enemies spawn in the eastern chamber (5) and southern chamber (3)
- **Enemy Texture**: Red-tinted 32x32 sprite with yellow eyes and dark border, visually distinct from the gold player
- **Enemy AI State Machine**:
  - `idle` state: Enemy stands still until player is within 200px detection range
  - `chasing` state: Enemy moves toward player at 80 px/sec (slower than player's 200 px/sec)
  - Stops chasing when player exceeds 400px (give up range)
  - Stops moving when within 40px of player (attack range - ready for combat implementation)
- **Physics**: Enemies collide with walls but don't push player or each other
- **Debug UI**: Shows enemy count and how many are currently chasing

## Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Added:
  - `gretchin` texture generation in `createTileTextures()` (lines 104-122)
  - `createEnemies()` method call in `create()` (line 136)
  - `createEnemies()` method with config, spawn points, and physics group (lines 367-426)
  - `updateEnemies()` method with AI state machine (lines 515-561)
  - Updated `createUI()` with enemy count display (lines 492-501)
  - Updated `updateDebugInfo()` to show enemy states (lines 594-605)

## How to Test
1. Start the http-server in the client directory: `cd /mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client && npx http-server`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Wait for the boot screen to load
4. Player spawns in the starting room (center-left of map)
5. Move east through the corridor to the eastern chamber - 5 red Gretchin enemies should be visible
6. Move south through the corridor to the southern chamber - 3 more enemies
7. Verify enemies:
   - Stand still when you're far away (idle)
   - Start moving toward you when within ~200 pixels
   - Stop chasing if you run away beyond ~400 pixels
   - Stop moving when very close (~40 pixels)
   - Collide with walls (don't walk through them)
   - Don't push you around (no physics collision between player/enemy)
8. Check bottom-left UI shows "Enemies: 8 (X chasing)" where X changes based on proximity
