## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - All JavaScript files pass Node.js syntax checking:
- `client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - ✓ No syntax errors
- `client/js/scenes/BootScene.js` - ✓ No syntax errors
- `client/js/game.js` - ✓ No syntax errors

### Code Review
The implementation is well-structured and follows Phaser.js best practices:

1. **Class structure** - Properly extends `Phaser.Scene` for both BootScene and GameScene
2. **Combat system** - All combat methods are properly defined and called:
   - `setupCombat()` - Initializes attack arc and damage tracking
   - `handlePlayerAttack()` - Handles SPACE key input with cooldown
   - `performPlayerAttack()` - Executes attack logic
   - `getEnemiesInAttackArc()` - Arc collision detection with proper angle math
   - `damageEnemy()` / `damagePlayer()` - Damage application with visual feedback
   - `handleEnemyContactDamage()` - Enemy touch damage with tick rate
3. **Enemy AI** - State machine (idle/chasing) with detection and attack ranges
4. **Death/Respawn** - Player death state with R key respawn handler
5. **UI Updates** - HP bar, cooldown indicator, and debug info properly updated in `update()`

### Files Verified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/index.html` - Correctly loads Phaser CDN and all JS files in proper order
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/game.js` - Proper Phaser config with arcade physics
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/BootScene.js` - Loading screen with transition
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Full combat implementation (~983 lines)

### Issues Found
**None** - The implementation is complete and matches the acceptance criteria:
- ✓ Melee attack with SPACE key (180° frontal arc, 50px range)
- ✓ 70 damage per hit with 0.5s cooldown
- ✓ Visual feedback (golden attack arc, red flash on hit, damage numbers)
- ✓ Enemy death animation (fade out + scale up)
- ✓ Enemy contact damage (8 DPS = 2 damage per 250ms tick)
- ✓ Player HP system (100 HP, color-coded bar)
- ✓ Player death screen with R to respawn
- ✓ Player rotation to face movement direction
