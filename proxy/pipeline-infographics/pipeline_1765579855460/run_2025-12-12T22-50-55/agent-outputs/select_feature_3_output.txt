Based on my analysis:

**Current Client State:**
- Player character exists (gold rectangle, 32x32)
- Movement with WASD/arrows is implemented
- Arcade physics with world bounds collision
- Basic grid background

**What's NOT implemented yet:**
- No tile-based map/world (just a simple grid pattern using lines)
- No collision with obstacles/walls
- No enemies
- No combat
- No health/death
- No UI elements (health bar, HUD)

Following the priority order, the first missing feature is **#2: Basic map/world** - the current implementation only has a simple line-based grid, not actual tiles or a proper world that the player navigates.

## Selected Feature
**Basic Tilemap World**

## What to Implement
Create a tile-based map using Phaser's tilemap system:
- **Ground tiles**: Use different colored rectangles (no external assets needed) to represent floor types
  - Imperial metal floor tiles (dark gray #2a2a3e)
  - Corridor tiles (slightly lighter #3a3a4e)
  - Hazard/damaged tiles (reddish tint #3e2a2a)
- **Wall tiles**: Solid obstacles the player cannot pass through (dark purple/black #1a1a2e with border)
- **Map layout**: A simple starter room/corridor structure (20x15 tiles at 32px = 640x480 visible area within 800x600 canvas)
- **Collision layer**: Walls should block player movement
- **Camera**: Follow the player if map is larger than viewport

## Reference from Design Docs
From combat-design.md:
- "WASD" movement confirmed as standard control scheme
- "180° frontal arc for melee attacks" implies positional gameplay matters
- "Levels 1-5 (Tutorial Zone)" design with "Clear space with minimal adds" suggests open areas with some structure

From player-experience.md:
- "05:00-15:00 - Tutorial Begins (Shrine World)" - Imperial aesthetic (dark, gothic)
- "First movement controls (WASD)" confirmed
- "30:00-50:00 - First Zone Exploration" - "Open area after tutorial corridor" implies corridor-to-open-area level design
- "Cathedral Complex (Imperial hub)" aesthetic reference

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Tilemap renders with visible floor tiles (not just grid lines)
2. ✅ At least 3 different tile types visible (floor variants)
3. ✅ Wall tiles exist and are visually distinct (darker/bordered)
4. ✅ Player cannot walk through wall tiles (collision working)
5. ✅ Map is at least 25x19 tiles (800x608 pixels, larger than viewport)
6. ✅ Camera follows player when moving near map edges
7. ✅ Player spawns in a valid (non-wall) location
8. ✅ Gothic/Imperial aesthetic maintained (dark colors, industrial feel)
