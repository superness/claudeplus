## Implemented
**UI Elements - Skill Bar HUD** with the following features:

1. **8-slot skill bar** centered at bottom of screen with imperial gothic styling
2. **Elite skill slot** (9th slot) with purple/locked styling and separator from regular slots
3. **First slot** shows "Chop" ability (70 damage, 3s cooldown, 8 energy cost) with axe icon
4. **Hotkey labels** (1-8 and E for elite) on each slot
5. **Energy bar** below HP bar (55 max energy, 3/sec regen per design docs)
6. **Cooldown overlay** on skill slots - darkens from bottom-up as cooldown progresses
7. **Cooldown timer** displays remaining time in seconds on the slot
8. **Skill tooltips** on hover showing damage/cooldown/energy info
9. **Energy consumption** - attacks now cost 8 energy and show "Not enough energy!" warning when depleted
10. **Key binding** - both SPACE and "1" key trigger the Chop attack

## Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Added skill bar configuration, energy system, skill bar rendering with cooldown visuals, and hotkey integration

## How to Test
1. Open the game client in a browser (serve the `client/` directory)
2. Verify the skill bar appears at the bottom center of the screen with 8+1 slots
3. Verify slot 1 shows an axe icon and has gold border (active skill)
4. Verify slots 2-8 are empty/muted, elite slot is purple/locked
5. Press 1 or SPACE to attack - watch energy drain (8 energy per attack)
6. Watch energy regenerate over time (3/sec)
7. Observe cooldown overlay darken slot 1 after attacking (3 second cooldown)
8. Hover over slot 1 to see tooltip: "Chop, Damage: 70, Cooldown: 3s, Energy: 8"
9. Spam attacks until energy depletes - should see "Not enough energy!" message
