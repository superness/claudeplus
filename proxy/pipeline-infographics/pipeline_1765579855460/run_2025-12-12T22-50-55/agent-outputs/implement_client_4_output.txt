## Implemented
**Basic Tilemap World** - A procedurally generated tile-based map system for the tutorial zone:

1. **Tile Texture Generation** - Programmatically creates 4 tile textures:
   - `floor1` - Dark imperial metal plating (0x2a2a3e) with subtle grid lines
   - `floor2` - Lighter corridor plating (0x3a3a4e) for rooms/corridors
   - `floor3` - Hazard/damaged floor (0x3e2a2a) with diagonal stripe
   - `wall` - Solid walls with 3D effect and border highlight

2. **Map Layout** (40x30 tiles = 1280x960 pixels):
   - Border walls around entire map
   - Central starting room (10x8 tiles) with doorways in all 4 directions
   - North corridor leading up from start
   - East corridor leading to an eastern chamber with hazard tiles
   - South corridor leading to a southern chamber
   - Scattered 2x2 pillars as obstacles
   - Occasional hazard tiles for visual variety

3. **Physics Collision** - Wall tiles are in a static physics group that blocks player movement

4. **Camera System** - Camera follows player with smooth lerp (0.1) and is bounded to the map

5. **Player Improvements** - Custom player texture with visor detail, spawns in center of starting room

6. **UI** - Title and controls hint fixed to camera, tile position debug display

## Files Modified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Complete rewrite with tilemap system

## How to Test
1. Open `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/index.html` in a browser
2. Wait for loading screen to complete
3. Verify:
   - Player spawns in the lighter-colored starting room
   - Three different floor tile types are visible (dark, light, reddish)
   - Walls are visibly distinct with borders
   - WASD/arrow keys move the player
   - Player cannot walk through walls (collision works)
   - Camera follows player when moving toward map edges
   - Tile coordinates update in bottom-left as you move
