Based on my analysis:

**Current Implementation Status:**
1. ✅ Player character movement - Complete (WASD/arrows, 200px/s)
2. ✅ Basic map/world - Complete (tutorial zone with rooms and corridors)
3. ✅ Collision - Complete (player and enemy wall collisions)
4. ✅ Enemy spawning - Complete (8 gretchin enemies with chase AI)
5. ❌ **Basic combat - NOT IMPLEMENTED**
6. ❌ Health/death - NOT IMPLEMENTED

The game has a player sprite, tilemap, collisions, and enemies that chase the player, but there's no way to attack or take damage.

## Selected Feature
**Basic Combat**

## What to Implement
A simple melee attack system for the player:
- **Attack Key**: SPACE bar triggers a melee attack
- **Attack Animation**: Visual feedback (player sprite flash or swing indicator)
- **Attack Hitbox**: 180° frontal arc, ~50px range (matching design doc's "180° frontal arc for melee attacks")
- **Damage**: Player deals 70 damage per hit (matching Choppa Boy's "Chop" base damage from design)
- **Attack Cooldown**: 0.5 second between attacks
- **Enemy Damage**: When enemies are within attack range (40px per design), they deal 8 DPS to player (gretchin stat)
- **Hit Feedback**: Enemy flashes red when hit, player flashes when taking damage

## Reference from Design Docs
From `combat-design.md`:

**Targeting System (lines 38-40):**
> - 180° frontal arc for melee attacks

**Gretchin Enemy Stats (line 846):**
> | Gretchin | 60 | 10 | 8 | Swarm, cowardly |
(HP: 60, Armor: 10, DPS: 8)

**Enemy Attack Range (line 373):**
> attackRange: 40,     // Stop moving when within 40px of player

**Basic Melee Skill Reference - Choppa Boy (line 606):**
> ├── Chop: 70 damage, 3 sec CD, 8 energy

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pressing SPACE causes the player to attack
2. Enemies within 50px in front of the player take damage when attacked
3. Enemies have visible HP (60 HP each per design)
4. Damaged enemies flash red briefly
5. When enemy HP reaches 0, they are destroyed (removed from game)
6. Player takes continuous damage (8 DPS) when enemies are within attack range
7. Player flashes when taking damage
8. Attack has a visible cooldown (0.5 sec) - cannot spam instantly
