## Summary

Created a Phaser.js game client scaffold with the following structure:

```
client/
├── index.html           # Main HTML with Phaser 3.60.0 CDN
├── package.json         # npm config with http-server
├── node_modules/        # Installed dependencies
└── js/
    ├── game.js          # Phaser config (800x600, arcade physics)
    └── scenes/
        ├── BootScene.js # Loading screen with progress bar
        └── GameScene.js # Main scene with player movement
```

**Features:**
- 800x600 canvas with dark theme background
- Boot scene shows "Game Loading..." with progress bar
- Game scene has grid background and movable player (gold rectangle)
- Player movement via WASD or arrow keys (200px/s, normalized diagonal)
- Arcade physics with world bounds collision

**To run:** `cd client && npm start` (opens at http://localhost:8080)
