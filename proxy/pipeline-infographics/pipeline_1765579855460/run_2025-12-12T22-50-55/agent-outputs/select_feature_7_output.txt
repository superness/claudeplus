Based on the previous stage inputs and current code analysis:

**Current Implementation Status:**
1. ✅ Player character - Gold/tan sprite with physics movement
2. ✅ Basic map/world - Procedural tilemap with rooms and corridors
3. ✅ Collision - Physics collider between player and walls
4. ❌ Enemy spawning - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
5. ❌ Basic combat
6. ❌ Health/death
7. ❌ UI elements (partial - has title and coords only)

## Selected Feature
**Enemy Spawning**

## What to Implement
Add basic enemies that spawn in the game world:

1. **Enemy Sprite** - Red-tinted rectangular sprite (similar to player style, ~32x32 pixels) with darker border
2. **Enemy Types** - Start with one type: "Gretchin" (weakest Ork enemy per design docs: 60 HP, 10 armor, 8 DPS)
3. **Spawn Locations** - Place 5-8 enemies in the eastern and southern chambers (not the starting room)
4. **Basic AI** - Enemies should:
   - Stand idle by default
   - Detect player within 200 pixels
   - Move toward player at 80 px/sec (slower than player's 200)
   - Stop moving when within 40 pixels of player
5. **Enemy Group** - Create a physics group for enemies with collision against walls

## Reference from Design Docs
From `combat-design.md` line 846-849:
```
| Gretchin | 60 | 10 | 8 | Swarm, cowardly |
| Slugga Boy | 200 | 50 | 30 | Rush to melee |
```

And from lines 1100-1105:
```
Levels 1-5 (Tutorial Zone):
├── Enemies: Common only, reduced damage
├── Mechanics: Basic (attack, move, use skill)
├── Deaths: Rare, educational respawns
└── Purpose: Teach systems safely
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. At least 5 enemy sprites visible in the eastern/southern chambers
2. Enemies have red-tinted appearance distinct from player
3. Enemies collide with walls (don't walk through)
4. Enemies detect player and move toward them when within 200px range
5. Enemies stop chasing when player moves beyond 400px (give up range)
6. Enemies and player do NOT push each other (no physics overlap collision yet - that's for combat)
7. Game still runs at smooth framerate with enemies updating
