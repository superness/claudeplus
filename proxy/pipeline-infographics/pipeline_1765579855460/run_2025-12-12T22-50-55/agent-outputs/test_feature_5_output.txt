All files are present. Now let me do a detailed code review to look for any bugs:

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - All JavaScript files pass Node.js syntax check:
- `js/game.js` - No errors
- `js/scenes/BootScene.js` - No errors  
- `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - No errors

### Code Review
The code is well-structured and follows good Phaser.js patterns. Key observations:

1. **GameScene.js (449 lines)** - Main game scene with:
   - Proper tile texture generation using `make.graphics`
   - Procedural map generation with walls, corridors, and rooms
   - Physics collision setup using `physics.add.staticGroup()`
   - WASD + arrow key input handling
   - Diagonal movement normalization (line 438-439)
   - Camera follow with bounds and lerp smoothing

2. **BootScene.js (58 lines)** - Loading scene:
   - Simple loading screen with progress bar
   - Delayed transition to GameScene (1 second)

3. **game.js (23 lines)** - Phaser config:
   - Arcade physics with no gravity (top-down game)
   - Correct scene registration: `[BootScene, GameScene]`

4. **index.html (35 lines)**:
   - Correct script loading order: Phaser -> BootScene -> GameScene -> game.js
   - Uses Phaser 3.60.0 from CDN

**No bugs found.** The code correctly:
- Generates textures before using them
- Sets up physics collision between player and walls
- Handles both WASD and arrow key input
- Normalizes diagonal movement to prevent faster diagonal speeds
- Uses `setScrollFactor(0)` for UI elements to keep them fixed on screen

### Files Verified
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/index.html` - Present and correct
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/game.js` - Present and correct
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/BootScene.js` - Present and correct
- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Present and correct

### Issues Found
None - The implementation is clean with no syntax errors or logical bugs detected.
