The fix has been applied. Let me verify the coordinates are valid by checking the southern chamber bounds in the map generation code:

- Southern chamber floor: `x >= centerX - 6` (4) to `x <= centerX + 6` (16), `y >= mapHeight - 10` (20) to `y <= mapHeight - 3` (27)
- New spawn points: (6, 23), (14, 24), (10, 26) - all within the valid floor range and avoiding the corridor walls at x=8 and x=12

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Southern chamber enemy spawn points on wall tiles
- File: `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/js/scenes/GameScene.js`
- Fix: Changed spawn coordinates from (8, 23) and (12, 24) to (6, 23) and (14, 24)
- Reason: The original coordinates (8, 23) and (12, 24) landed on south corridor wall tiles. The corridor walls are generated at x=8 (`centerX-2`) and x=12 (`centerX+2`) for y values between 20-24. By moving to x=6 and x=14, the enemies now spawn on valid floor tiles within the southern chamber, which spans x=4 to x=16.

DECISION: retry
