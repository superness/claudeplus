Found the bug! The spawn points (8, 23) and (12, 24) are being marked as "South corridor walls" because of this check:

```javascript
if ((x === centerX - 2 || x === centerX + 2) && y > centerY + 4 && y < mapHeight - 5) {
    return 9;
}
```

With `centerX = 10`:
- `centerX - 2 = 8` and `centerX + 2 = 12`
- `y > centerY + 4` means `y > 19`
- `y < mapHeight - 5` means `y < 25`

So (8, 23) and (12, 24) are hitting this corridor wall condition. They are on wall tiles in the current map design, not the chamber floor.

This is a bug in the spawn point placement - the spawn coordinates (8, 23) and (12, 24) are on the corridor walls that extend down from the main room. Only (10, 26) is correctly inside the southern chamber.

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - All JavaScript files pass syntax validation (node --check and ESLint report no errors)

### Code Review
**Issue Found**: Two southern chamber enemy spawn points are incorrectly placed on wall tiles:
- Spawn (8, 23) - lands on south corridor wall (x=8 matches centerX-2)
- Spawn (12, 24) - lands on south corridor wall (x=12 matches centerX+2)
- Only spawn (10, 26) is valid in the southern chamber

This means only 6 enemies will spawn (5 in eastern chamber, 1 in southern) instead of the intended 8 (5 eastern, 3 southern).

### Issues Found
1. **Bug**: Southern chamber spawn points (8, 23) and (12, 24) are on wall tiles (corridor walls at x=8 and x=12). These enemies won't spawn. Should be adjusted to coordinates within the southern chamber floor area (e.g., x=6 or x=14 instead of 8/12, or y values of 22-27 that don't conflict with corridor walls).
