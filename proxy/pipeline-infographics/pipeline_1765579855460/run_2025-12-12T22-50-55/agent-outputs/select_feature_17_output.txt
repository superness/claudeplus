Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current state and design documents. Let me analyze what's been implemented versus what comes next.

Based on the previous stage summaries and the GameScene.js code:

**Already Implemented (Features 1-6):**
1. ✅ Player character - Moving sprite with WASD/arrows
2. ✅ Basic map/world - Tilemap with multiple floor types and walls
3. ✅ Collision - Player can't walk through walls
4. ✅ Enemy spawning - 8 Gretchin enemies in eastern and southern chambers
5. ✅ Basic combat - SPACE key melee attack with 180° arc, 70 damage
6. ✅ Health/death - Player 100HP, enemies 60HP, death/respawn system

**Next Feature (Priority 7): UI elements** - The current implementation has basic UI (HP bar, cooldown indicator, coordinates), but according to the design docs, there should be more comprehensive UI elements like a skill bar and proper HUD.

## Selected Feature
**UI Elements - Skill Bar HUD**

## What to Implement
Create a proper 8-slot skill bar (Guild Wars 1 style) at the bottom of the screen with:
- 8 regular skill slots + 1 elite slot (greyed out for now)
- Visual cooldown indicators on each slot
- Hotkey labels (1-8 + Elite slot)
- First slot shows the current melee attack ("Chop" - the Choppa Boy skill from design docs)
- Energy/resource bar next to health
- The skill bar should be styled in the dark imperial gothic aesthetic

## Reference from Design Docs
From `combat-design.md`:
> "8-skill hotbar (Guild Wars 1 style)" (line 28)
> "Limited skill bar forces meaningful build choices" (line 11)
> "COMBAT FLOW - 8-skill hotbar (Guild Wars 1 style)" (line 28)

From `progression-design.md`:
> "4 basic skills" at Level 1 (line 810)
> "Skill bar expands to 6 skills" at Level 5 (line 821)
> "Full 8-skill bar" at Level 10 (line 829)

From `combat-design.md` - Choppa Boy skills (matching current player implementation):
> "Chop: 70 damage, 3 sec CD, 8 energy" (line 606)
> "Energy: 55 base, 3/sec regen" (line 595)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✓ 8 skill slots displayed horizontally at bottom center of screen
2. ✓ 1 elite slot (9th) displayed with different styling (locked/greyed)
3. ✓ Slot 1 shows "Chop" ability with 70dmg, currently usable via SPACE
4. ✓ Hotkey numbers (1-8) displayed on each slot
5. ✓ Energy bar displayed (55 max, 3/sec regen per design docs)
6. ✓ Cooldown visual overlay on slot 1 when attack is on cooldown
7. ✓ Imperial gothic styling matching existing dark theme (0x1a1a2e background, 0xc9aa71 gold accents)
8. ✓ All UI elements fixed to camera (don't scroll with world)
