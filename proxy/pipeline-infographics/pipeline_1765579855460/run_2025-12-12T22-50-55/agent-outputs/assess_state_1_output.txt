## Current State

- **Client exists**: No - No game client (index.html, game.js, Phaser) found. Only a node_modules index.html exists which is unrelated.
- **Design docs**: Comprehensive documentation exists in `design-docs/`:
  - combat-design.md
  - balance-analysis.md
  - progression-design.md
  - engagement-analysis.md
  - systems-integration.md
  - emergence-analysis.md
  - balance-audit.md
  - player-experience.md
  - data-model.md
  - api-specification.md
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express backend exists with:
  - Models: character, combat, skill, item, economy, social, guild, world
  - Services: auth, character, combat, economy, social, world, validation
  - API routes: auth, character, combat, social, economy, inventory, quest, world
  - WebSocket: combat handler
  - Database: PostgreSQL with migrations, repositories, seeds
  - Tests: comprehensive test suite
- **Can run**: Yes - Backend can run with `npm run dev` (requires PostgreSQL setup)

## Recommendation

The backend is well-developed but there is **no game client**. We need to set up a Phaser.js web client from scratch before implementing any game features. The client should:
1. Connect to the existing backend API
2. Implement player movement first
3. Then add combat features using the WebSocket combat handler
