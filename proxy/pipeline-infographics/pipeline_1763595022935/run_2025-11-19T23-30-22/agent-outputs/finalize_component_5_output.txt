Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to verify. Let me validate the wallet_manager agent against the requirements in section 2.2 of the plan.

## VERIFICATION

**What was promised**: Build the wallet_manager agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md with the following capabilities:
- Create new wallet (bitcoin-cli)
- Generate receive addresses
- Fund wallet (regtest mining)
- Query balance
- Monitor incoming transactions
- Export wallet for backup

**What was delivered**: A comprehensive JSON agent file at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json` containing:

1. **Proper metadata structure**:
   - ✅ id: "wallet_manager"
   - ✅ name: "Wallet Manager"
   - ✅ role: Well-defined purpose matching requirements

2. **All required capabilities present in systemPrompt**:
   - ✅ **Wallet Creation**: Complete section with createwallet command, parameters, error handling, and workflows
   - ✅ **Address Generation**: All address types (legacy, P2SH-SegWit, Bech32) with validation procedures
   - ✅ **Wallet Funding**: 101-block generation procedure with coinbase maturity explanation
   - ✅ **Balance Queries**: getbalance, getbalances, getunconfirmedbalance with detailed interpretation
   - ✅ **Transaction Monitoring**: listtransactions with filtering, confirmations tracking, UTXO management
   - ✅ **Wallet Backup**: backupwallet, dumpwallet, recovery procedures, and automated scripts

3. **Required permissions**: ✅ Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep (all present)

4. **Required decisions**: ✅ wallet_created, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, error (all present with explicit decision type)

5. **Additional quality features**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - Detailed task execution workflows with example flows
   - Best practices sections
   - Complete command reference
   - Security considerations
   - Success criteria for validation

## EVIDENCE_CHECK

The executor provided a detailed validation report showing 47/47 checks passed. Let me independently verify the critical aspects:

**File exists**: ✅ Successfully read the file at `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`

**Valid JSON**: ✅ File parses correctly with proper structure

**Required sections in systemPrompt**:
- ✅ Section 1: Wallet Creation (lines 15-110 in systemPrompt) - createwallet with all parameters
- ✅ Section 2: Address Generation (lines covering getnewaddress, address types, validation)
- ✅ Section 3: Wallet Funding (lines covering 101-block generation, coinbase maturity)
- ✅ Section 4: Balance Queries (lines covering getbalance, getbalances, interpretation)
- ✅ Section 5: Transaction Monitoring (lines covering listtransactions, filtering, confirmations)
- ✅ Section 6: Backup and Export (lines covering backupwallet, dumpwallet, recovery)

**Permissions array**: ✅ Contains ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]

**Decisions configuration**: ✅ decisionType: "explicit", allowedDecisions: ["wallet_created", "wallet_funded", "balance_confirmed", "error"]

**Validation criteria**: ✅ 8 comprehensive validation criteria provided

## QUALITY_ASSESSMENT

**Technical completeness**: EXCELLENT
- The systemPrompt is exceptionally comprehensive (32,398 bytes)
- All bitcoin-cli commands properly documented with examples
- Error handling covers common failure scenarios
- Task execution patterns provide clear workflows
- Example flows demonstrate practical usage

**Requirements alignment**: PERFECT
- Every requirement from section 2.2 is addressed
- Matches the structure and quality of bitcoin_daemon_manager
- Follows agent framework conventions consistently

**Production readiness**: HIGH
- Includes best practices and security considerations
- Provides automated backup scripts
- Documents regtest-specific behaviors
- Clear decision points throughout all workflows

**Documentation quality**: EXCELLENT
- Clear command examples with actual syntax
- Detailed explanations of coinbase maturity, balance types, address formats
- Comprehensive error handling section
- Well-organized reference sections

**Minor observations** (not issues):
- The executor correctly created the file in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` (not in the SuperCoinServ directory)
- This is appropriate as it's part of the claudeplus agent framework
- File is ready for immediate use in the agent orchestration system

[DECISION: APPROVED]
