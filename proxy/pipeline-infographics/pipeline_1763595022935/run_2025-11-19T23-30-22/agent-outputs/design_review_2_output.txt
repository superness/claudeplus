ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding:** The plan demonstrates comprehensive understanding of the wallet_manager agent requirements from section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
2. **Structured Approach:** The 5-step approach is logical - reading existing files, reviewing specifications, examining similar agents, designing the JSON structure, and writing the complete file
3. **Specific Technical Details:** The plan lists concrete bitcoin-cli commands (createwallet, getnewaddress, generatetoaddress, getbalance, listtransactions, backupwallet) that will be needed
4. **Proper Decision Points:** Correctly identifies the required decision outputs (wallet_created, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, error) and their transitions

**Test Considerations are Exceptional:**
- Covers all major operations with specific bitcoin-cli commands
- Addresses error scenarios (wallet exists, RPC failures, invalid addresses)
- Considers regtest-specific requirements (block maturation for coinbase)
- Distinguishes between confirmed/unconfirmed balances
- Includes backup/recovery verification

**Evidence Collection is Strong:**
The plan specifies it will:
- Read and show the existing wallet_manager.json state
- Reference the specific plan document requirements
- Create complete agent JSON with all capabilities
- Include specific bitcoin-cli commands for verification
- Define clear success criteria and decision outputs
- Show the final written file content

**Potential Concerns:**
1. The plan mentions reading an existing wallet_manager.json, but it's unclear if this file already exists or needs to be created from scratch
2. No explicit verification step to test the agent JSON structure is valid JSON and follows claudeplus schema requirements
3. Could be more specific about HOW the evidence will prove the agent works (e.g., "Will verify JSON is valid by parsing it" or "Will show all required fields are present")

**Evidence Quality Analysis:**

STRONG elements:
- Comprehensive test scenarios covering all operations
- Specific bitcoin-cli commands that can be verified
- Clear decision flow validation

MODERATE concerns:
- Evidence focuses on file content but doesn't explicitly state how to verify the JSON structure is correct/valid
- No mention of comparing against a schema or running validation checks

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong (with minor gaps in validation methodology)

**Overall Assessment:**
The plan is detailed, technically sound, and shows expert-level understanding of both the requirements and bitcoin wallet management. The test considerations are particularly thorough. The main gap is explicit validation of the JSON structure itself, but the overall approach will produce verifiable results.

**Reasoning for Decision:**
- Clear, specific understanding of requirements ✓
- Logical step-by-step approach ✓
- Concrete bitcoin-cli commands and operations specified ✓
- Comprehensive test scenarios ✓
- High confidence with strong technical justification ✓
- Evidence will include file content showing all required capabilities ✓

The plan will produce a complete, verifiable agent JSON file with all required capabilities clearly documented.

DECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)
