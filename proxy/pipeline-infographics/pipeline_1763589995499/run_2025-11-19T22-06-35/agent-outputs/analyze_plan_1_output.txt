UNDERSTANDING: User wants to execute a workflow called "meta-pipeline-builder-v2". This appears to be a custom workflow or script that exists within this codebase, likely related to building or configuring pipelines for this cryptocurrency mining pool server project.

APPROACH: I will search for the meta-pipeline-builder-v2 workflow definition in the codebase to understand what it does, locate its entry point (script, configuration, or executable), examine its dependencies and requirements, and then execute it following its documented process or inferred execution method.

STEPS:
1) Use Grep to search for "meta-pipeline-builder-v2" across the codebase to find references, configuration files, or scripts
2) Use Glob to find any files with names matching "*pipeline*", "*meta*", or "*workflow*" patterns
3) Read any discovered workflow definition files to understand the pipeline structure and execution requirements
4) Search for documentation files (README, docs folders) that might explain the workflow
5) Examine any build scripts, configuration files, or CI/CD definitions that might reference this workflow
6) Check for executable scripts or entry points (bash scripts, PowerShell, batch files, or programmatic entry points)
7) Verify any prerequisites or dependencies required by the workflow (environment variables, tools, configurations)
8) Execute the workflow using the appropriate command or script
9) Monitor the execution output for errors or completion status
10) Validate the workflow completed successfully by checking outputs, logs, or generated artifacts

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: Will need to handle scenarios where:
- The workflow doesn't exist in the codebase (need to search thoroughly)
- The workflow requires specific parameters or configuration
- Dependencies are missing or not configured
- The workflow is meant to be run in a specific context (CI/CD vs local)
- Multiple versions or variations of the pipeline exist

EVIDENCE: Will collect:
- Search results showing where the workflow is defined
- The workflow definition/configuration file contents
- Any documentation or comments explaining the workflow
- Command used to execute the workflow
- Complete execution output and logs
- Any artifacts or files generated by the workflow
- Exit codes or success indicators

CONFIDENCE: Medium - The workflow name suggests it's a custom component of this project, but without searching the codebase first, I cannot confirm its existence, location, or execution method. The confidence will increase once I locate the workflow definition.
