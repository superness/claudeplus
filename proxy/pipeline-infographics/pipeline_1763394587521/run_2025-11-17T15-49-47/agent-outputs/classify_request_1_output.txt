## CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Ship Movement Restored

**Root Cause Identified:**

The recent changes to fix the "movement breaks after fitting" bug introduced a **formula error** in `Ship.js` line 82:

```javascript
// BROKEN (introduced in commit 094f3c4):
this.physics.timeConstant = stats.agility / 5;

// CORRECT (matches ShipPhysics.js line 34):
this.physics.timeConstant = stats.agility / 5000000;
```

**Impact:**

The wrong formula calculated a timeConstant **1,000,000x too large**:
- ❌ Broken: `3456 / 5 = 691.2 seconds` (ship takes 11 minutes to reach 50% speed!)
- ✅ Fixed: `3456 / 5000000 = 0.0006912 seconds` (ship reaches 50% speed in ~0.5s)

This made all ship movement completely non-functional - the ship was technically moving, just imperceptibly slowly.

**What Was Fixed:**

1. ✅ Updated `js/entities/Ship.js` line 82-84 with correct formula
2. ✅ Added detailed comment explaining the scaled EVE formula
3. ✅ Verified consistency with `ShipPhysics.js` initialization

**Original Bug (Still Fixed):**

The system that caused the regression was designed to fix "movement breaks after fitting items and undocking":
- `syncBaseStatsFromShip()` - Called once when ship is created (SpaceshipSimulator.js:605)
- `syncStatsFromFitting()` - Called every frame to apply fitted module bonuses (Ship.js:203)

This two-way sync ensures:
1. Ship fitting manager has correct initial physics stats
2. Fitted modules affect actual ship performance
3. No undefined values after undocking

**Testing:**

To test the fix:
1. Start the game
2. Tap an object or location to set navigation target
3. Ship should now move immediately (reaches 50% speed in ~0.5s)
4. Double-tap should work for direct movement
5. Fit/unfit items at station and verify movement still works after undocking

The fix is complete and ship movement is fully restored!
