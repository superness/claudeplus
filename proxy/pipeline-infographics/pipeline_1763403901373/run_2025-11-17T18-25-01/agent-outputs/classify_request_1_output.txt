  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug report. The user describes broken functionality - ships are not accelerating/decelerating properly and are instead instantly jumping to throttle values. This violates the expected EVE-style physics behavior. The user explicitly states 'what broke', indicating something that previously worked is now malfunctioning. The request includes investigation, root cause analysis, fixing, and testing - all classic bug fix activities.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The user reports a bug in the space physics system: ships are instantly moving at whatever speed the throttle is set to, instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually. The ship should speed up when throttle increases and slow down when throttle decreases, but currently it's jumping directly to the throttle value. Investigate the ship movement/physics code to find what broke, identify the root cause, fix the acceleration/deceleration system, and test that ships now properly speed up and slow down instead of instantly matching throttle.",
