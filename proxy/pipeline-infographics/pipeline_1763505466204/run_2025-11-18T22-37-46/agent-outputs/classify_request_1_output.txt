I'll analyze this request to classify it properly.

**Analysis:**

The user wants to modify the existing "reset player state" feature to also reset intro/tutorial popup state. Let me examine the key aspects:

1. **Existing Feature**: There's already a "reset player state" function
2. **Required Change**: Add additional reset logic to clear intro/tutorial popup state
3. **Scope**: Need to find where intro popup state is stored and add a few lines to reset it
4. **Complexity**: This is a targeted enhancement to existing functionality

**Key Indicators:**
- "modify the reset player state function" - indicates existing code needs updating
- "also reset the intro popups" - adding functionality to existing feature
- "clear this state" - specific action needed
- Requires code investigation + small modification

**Classification Decision:**

This falls between QUICK_CHANGE and FEATURE_REQUEST, but leans more toward **FEATURE_REQUEST** because:
- It's enhancing existing functionality with new behavior
- Requires investigation to find where intro state is stored
- Adds a new capability (resetting tutorial state) to an existing feature
- More than just changing a value - it's extending what the reset function does

If this was just "clear the tutorial state", it might be QUICK_CHANGE, but the requirement to "also" do this as part of reset player state makes it a feature enhancement.

DECISION: FEATURE_REQUEST
