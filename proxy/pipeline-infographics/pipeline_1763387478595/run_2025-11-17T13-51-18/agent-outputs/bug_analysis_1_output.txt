Based on the bug report, here's my structured analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship movement system completely non-functional - no visual movement despite navigation commands and tap-to-move inputs",
  "expectedBehavior": "When user issues navigation commands (keyboard input) or tap-to-move commands (mobile touch input), the ship should visibly move to the target location with EVE-style physics (exponential acceleration curves)",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary on screen despite receiving navigation commands and tap-to-move inputs. No visual movement occurs.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "input",
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "rendering",
    "mobile-controls"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and ship to appear in space",
    "Step 3: Try keyboard navigation (WASD or arrow keys)",
    "Step 4: Observe ship remains stationary",
    "Step 5: Try double-tap on mobile (or simulate touch in DevTools device mode)",
    "Step 6: Observe ship still does not move to tapped location",
    "Step 7: Check browser console for errors"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/SceneManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/NavigationManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The bug appears to be a broken pipeline between input → movement logic → rendering. Possible causes: (1) Input events not being captured/processed by InputManager or MobileInputManager, (2) Navigation commands not being translated to physics updates in ShipPhysics.js, (3) Physics updates calculating but not being applied to ship position, (4) Ship position updating but rendering not reflecting changes, (5) Animation loop (requestAnimationFrame) not running or update() not being called, (6) Recent changes to WebSocket automation or testing framework may have disrupted core game loop"
}
```

**Additional Context from Git Status:**
- Multiple modified files related to input (InputManager.js, MobileInputManager noted as new)
- Ship.js and ShipPhysics.js both modified
- SpaceshipSimulator.js (main game loop) modified
- Recent WebSocket automation changes may have introduced regression

**Critical Investigation Points:**
1. Is the game loop (update/render cycle) running at all?
2. Are input events reaching the InputManager/MobileInputManager?
3. Is Ship.setDestination() being called when navigation commands are issued?
4. Are physics calculations in ShipPhysics.update() executing?
5. Is ship.mesh.position being updated in Three.js scene?
6. Are there console errors blocking execution?
