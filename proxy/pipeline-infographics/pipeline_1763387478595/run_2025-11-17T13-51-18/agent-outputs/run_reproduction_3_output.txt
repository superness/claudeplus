## Critical Findings

**Infrastructure Status:**
- WebSocket automation framework started ✓
- Game connected to WebSocket server ✓
- Test client connected ✓
- Console logger captured output ✓

**Test Execution Failure:**
- First command `getShipState` returned `undefined` response
- Test script terminated immediately after first command failure
- No ship movement testing occurred due to command infrastructure failure

**Console Errors Detected:**
1. TestingBrowserBridge.js:107 - WebSocket error events (2x)
2. Authentication errors (DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT, PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR, wrong_secret)
3. GCM login failure

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The WebSocket connection was established between game and test client, but the command execution layer is returning undefined responses instead of actual data. This indicates a problem in the TestingBrowserBridge command handler implementation, not the WebSocket transport layer.
