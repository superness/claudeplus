Perfect! Now I have complete evidence. Let me compile my verification analysis:

## Verification Decision

The bug is **CONFIRMED** based on runtime console log evidence:

1. **Runtime Evidence Present**: ✅ 500+ console log entries captured over 35 seconds
2. **Console Logs Present**: ✅ Complete console output with detailed ship state logging
3. **Console Error Detection**: ✅ 1 TypeError + 1 critical undefined error (thrustInput.magnitude)
4. **Bug Symptoms Match**: ✅ Player ship velocity=(0,0,0), navigationCommand type='none', thrustInput undefined
5. **Root Cause Indicators**: ✅ Console logs point to input → navigation command → physics pipeline failure

## Critical Findings

### Player Ship State (500+ samples)
- `navigationCommand.type`: "none" (no commands being issued)
- `velocity`: (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
- `targetVelocity`: (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
- `thrustInput.magnitude`: **undefined** ⚠️

### NPC Ship State (5 NPCs functioning normally)
- Target velocities calculated every frame
- Physics simulations executing
- No undefined thrust inputs

### Console Errors
1. **ScrollingHeaderFix.js:363**: `TypeError: window.simulator.objectGrid.updateDisplay is not a function`
2. **Ship.js:364**: `thrustInput.magnitude: undefined` (500+ occurrences)

### Evidence Quality
- ✅ WebSocket automation server started
- ✅ Game connected successfully
- ✅ Console logger captured complete output
- ❌ WebSocket command execution failed (infrastructure bug, not ship movement bug)
- ✅ Console logs provide independent verification of ship movement bug

## Conclusion

Despite the WebSocket automation framework having a separate bug (getShipState returns malformed responses), the console logs provide **conclusive independent evidence** that the ship movement bug exists. The player ship has persistently zero velocity, no navigation commands, and undefined thrust input throughout the entire test run.

The bug is confirmed through console log analysis even though the WebSocket automation could not programmatically verify it.

**DECISION: BUG_CONFIRMED** (Bug confirmed, proceed to root cause analysis focusing on js/core/InputManager.js and thrustInput creation at Ship.js:364)
