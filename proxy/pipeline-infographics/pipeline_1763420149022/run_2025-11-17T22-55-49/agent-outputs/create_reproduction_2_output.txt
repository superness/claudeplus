Excellent! Now let me verify the fix works by checking if the code is correctly integrated. Let me create a summary of what I fixed:

## Bug Fix Summary

### Problem
The center progress-filling circle visualization was missing from the RadialHUD during hover interactions. The hover delay mechanism worked correctly (menu opened after 500ms), but there was no visual feedback showing the progress.

### Root Cause
1. **No canvas element created**: The `HoverProgressIndicator` class implemented a canvas-based `render(ctx)` method (lines 153-204) that draws the progress circle, but no canvas element was created in RadialHUD
2. **Render method never called**: The `updateHoverProgress()` method updated the progress value but never called `progressIndicator.render(ctx)` to actually draw the circle on screen
3. **Missing infrastructure**: The complete rendering infrastructure was missing - no canvas element, no 2D context, no render calls

### Solution Implemented

**In RadialHUD.js:**

1. **Added canvas properties** (lines 136-138):
   - `this.progressCanvas` - Canvas element for rendering
   - `this.progressCtx` - 2D rendering context

2. **Created `createProgressCanvas()` method** (lines 369-389):
   - Creates a full-screen canvas overlay
   - Positioned as `fixed` with `pointer-events: none` to not block interactions
   - High z-index (9999) to appear above other UI elements
   - Gets 2D rendering context

3. **Updated `initialize()` method** (line 155):
   - Calls `createProgressCanvas()` to create the canvas infrastructure

4. **Updated `updateHoverProgress()` method** (lines 486-490):
   - Clears the canvas each frame
   - Calls `progressIndicator.render(this.progressCtx)` to draw the progress circle

5. **Updated cleanup methods**:
   - `completeHoverTimer()` (lines 526-529): Clears canvas when timer completes
   - `cancelHoverTimer()` (lines 560-563): Clears canvas when timer is cancelled
   - `destroy()` (lines 1083-1088): Removes canvas element on cleanup

**In HoverProgressIndicator.js:**

6. **Added `destroy()` method** (lines 221-226):
   - Provides cleanup functionality by calling `reset()`
   - Prevents errors when RadialHUD calls `progressIndicator.destroy()`

### Expected Behavior After Fix
When hovering over the center of the RadialHUD:
1. A circular progress indicator appears at the mouse cursor position
2. The circle fills clockwise from the top (12 o'clock position)
3. Progress is smooth and follows the 500ms hover threshold
4. Blue glow effect with pulsing animation when >90% complete
5. Circle disappears when hover is cancelled or menu opens

The fix is now complete and ready for testing!
