Good! Now the progress circle will render immediately when visible is true, even when progress is 0 (showing at least the background circle). This ensures the visual feedback appears as soon as the user starts hovering.

Let me create the fix summary:

```json
{
  "filesModified": [
    {
      "path": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/HoverProgressIndicator.js",
      "changes": [
        {
          "lineNumber": 154,
          "oldCode": "if (!this.visible || this.progress <= 0) {\n    return;\n}",
          "newCode": "// Bug fix: Changed from `progress <= 0` to `progress < 0` to allow rendering\n// even when progress is exactly 0, ensuring the progress circle always appears\n// when visible is true (the background circle should show immediately on hover)\nif (!this.visible || this.progress < 0) {\n    return;\n}",
          "reason": "The condition `progress <= 0` prevented the progress circle from rendering on the first frame when progress was exactly 0, causing the visual indicator to never appear. Changed to `progress < 0` to allow rendering even at 0% progress, so the background circle and progress arc display immediately when hovering starts."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fixSummary": "Fixed missing center progress circle by changing early-exit condition from 'progress <= 0' to 'progress < 0', allowing the circle to render immediately when visible",
  "expectedImpact": "The progress-filling circle will now display in the center of the radial HUD as soon as hovering begins, showing the background circle and progress arc animation from 0% to 100%",
  "riskAssessment": "Very low risk - simple condition change that makes rendering more permissive, no side effects or breaking changes",
  "additionalNotes": "The fix ensures that when the user hovers over the center trigger, they immediately see visual feedback (the background circle) even before the progress arc begins filling. This provides better UX by showing the hover interaction is being detected."
}
```

The fix is now implemented. The center progress circle will display correctly when hovering over the radial HUD center trigger.
