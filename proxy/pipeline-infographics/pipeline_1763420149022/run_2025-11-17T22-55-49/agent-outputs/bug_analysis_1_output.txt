Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me create the bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Center progress-filling circle visualization is not rendering in RadialHUD during hover-to-open interaction",
  "expectedBehavior": "When hovering over the center trigger area of the RadialHUD, a circular progress indicator should appear in the center, filling clockwise from the top as the hover timer progresses (0-500ms). The circle should use canvas rendering with a blue glow effect and pulse when nearing completion (>90%).",
  "actualBehavior": "No visual progress circle appears during hover. The hover delay mechanism works correctly (menu opens after 500ms), but the visual feedback (progress-filling circle) is completely missing.",
  "affectedSystems": ["UI", "RadialHUD", "HoverProgressIndicator"],
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser (index.html)",
    "Step 2: Hover mouse over the center of the RadialHUD (center trigger area, ~120px diameter circle)",
    "Step 3: Hold mouse stationary for 500ms",
    "Step 4: Observe that inner ring menu opens correctly after delay",
    "Step 5: Notice that NO progress circle visualization appears during the hover period"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/RadialHUD.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/HoverProgressIndicator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The HoverProgressIndicator class implements a canvas-based render() method (lines 153-204) that draws the progress circle, but this render() method is NEVER being called. The RadialHUD creates the progressIndicator instance (line 156) and updates its progress (line 457), but there is no canvas element created and no call to progressIndicator.render(ctx) in the animation loop. The rendering infrastructure is completely missing - we need to: 1) Create a canvas element in the RadialHUD container, 2) Get the 2D rendering context, 3) Call progressIndicator.render(ctx) in the updateHoverProgress() animation loop to actually draw the circle on screen."
}
