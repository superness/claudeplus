## Test Execution Report

### Environment Setup Status
✅ **HTTP Server**: Running on port 8080 with `-c-1` flag (no caching)  
✅ **Working Directory**: /mnt/c/github/superstarships  
✅ **Old Chrome Processes**: Killed successfully  
❌ **Chrome CDP Endpoint**: FAILED TO START

### Framework Error Detected

**Issue**: Chrome Remote Debugging Port Not Starting

The test infrastructure encountered a critical failure preventing test execution. Despite multiple attempts using different methods, the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint on port 9222 never became available.

**Attempts Made**:
1. **Standardized launch script** - CDP endpoint timeout after 30 seconds
2. **Direct Chrome launch from WSL** - Process started but endpoint unresponsive (ECONNREFUSED)
3. **Puppeteer connection test** - Failed with "fetch failed" error

**Root Cause**: Chrome is launching but the remote debugging interface is not responding to HTTP requests on localhost:9222. This is likely due to:
- WSL-Windows networking interop issues
- Chrome security policies blocking remote debugging in WSL environment
- Windows Firewall blocking localhost:9222 from WSL
- User data directory permissions

**Impact**: All Puppeteer-based automated tests are blocked. Cannot verify the hover progress canvas fix through automation.

### Bug Fix Summary (Implemented but Untested)

The code fix was successfully implemented in the previous stage:

**File Modified**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/RadialHUD.js`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added canvas properties (`progressCanvas`, `progressCtx`) 
2. Created `createProgressCanvas()` method to initialize full-screen canvas overlay
3. Updated `initialize()` to call `createProgressCanvas()`
4. Updated `updateHoverProgress()` to render progress indicator
5. Updated cleanup methods to clear canvas

**Expected Behavior**: When hovering over the center of the RadialHUD, a circular progress indicator should appear and fill clockwise from 0% to 100% over 500ms.

### Recommendation

**Manual Testing Required**: Since automated testing infrastructure is currently non-functional, the fix should be verified through manual browser testing:

1. Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
2. Hover mouse over the center of the RadialHUD  
3. Verify that a progress circle appears and fills as you hover
4. Verify the circle disappears when hover is cancelled or menu opens

**Test Result**: INCONCLUSIVE (cannot execute automated validation)
