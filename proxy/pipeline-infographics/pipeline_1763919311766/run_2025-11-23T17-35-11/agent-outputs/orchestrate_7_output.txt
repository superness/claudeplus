## Infrastructure State Analysis

Current state assessment:

**Dependencies**: ✓ All installed
- bitcoind: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind` (running, PID 3919)
- Mono runtime: `/usr/bin/mono` (available)
- cpuminer: `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer` (available)

**Configurations**: ✓ All exist
- Daemon config: `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (RPC: coiniumtest/testpass123, port 18443)
- Pool config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json` (configured)
- Pool-specific config: `config/pools/default.json` (Stratum port 3333, daemon connection configured)

**Bitcoin Daemon**: ✓ RUNNING
- Process: Running (PID 3919)
- RPC: Accessible on port 18443 ✓
- Blockchain: 2694 blocks in regtest chain
- Wallet: "miner_wallet" loaded, immature balance 0.00038146 BTC (1 tx)

**CoiniumServ Pool**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL
- Process: Running (PIDs 20759, 20761)
- Daemon connection: Working (JobManager receiving block templates from daemon) ✓
- Stratum port: **NOT listening on port 3333** ✗
- Issue: Pool process running but Stratum server not bound to port 3333

**Miner**: ⚠️ Not configured yet

## Problem Identified

The pool server is running and successfully connected to the daemon (logs show "A new block 2695 + 0 emerged in network, rebroadcasting new work"), but the **Stratum port 3333 is not listening**. This means:
1. Pool can receive block templates from daemon ✓
2. Pool cannot accept miner connections ✗ (Stratum port not open)

This is a **pool-specific error** - the Stratum server component failed to initialize properly despite the daemon connection working.

## Decision

REASONING:
Pool server has a critical issue: Stratum port 3333 is not listening despite the pool process running and successfully connecting to the daemon. The logs show JobManager is working (receiving block templates), but the Stratum server component that accepts miner connections is not operational.

This is a pool-specific configuration or startup error. The pool needs to be analyzed and potentially restarted with proper Stratum initialization. This requires the pool error handler specialist to diagnose why Stratum failed to bind to port 3333.

Infrastructure Status:
- Dependencies: Installed ✓
- Configs: Generated ✓
- Daemon: Running, RPC accessible, blocks at 2694 ✓
- Pool: Process running but Stratum port NOT listening ✗
- Miner: Not configured yet

Next step: Route to pool error handler to diagnose and fix Stratum port binding issue.
