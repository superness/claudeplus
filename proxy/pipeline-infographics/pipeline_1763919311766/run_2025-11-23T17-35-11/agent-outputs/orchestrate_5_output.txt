## STATE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✅ **Dependencies**: Installed
- bitcoind: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind` ✓
- Mono runtime: `/usr/bin/mono` ✓
- CoiniumServ: Process running (PID 40056) ✓

✅ **Configurations**: Exist
- Daemon config: `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` ✓
- Pool config: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json` ✓
- Pool-specific config: `config/pools/default.json` ✓

✅ **Bitcoin Daemon**: RUNNING
- Process PIDs: 3919, 18585 ✓
- Network: regtest ✓
- Block height: 2693 ✓
- RPC accessible: Yes (port 18443) ✓
- Wallets loaded: testwallet, miner_wallet ✓

⚠️ **CoiniumServ Pool**: PARTIALLY RUNNING (with issues)
- Process running: Yes (PID 40056) ✓
- Stratum server: Claims to be listening on 0.0.0.0:3333 ✓
- **PROBLEM 1**: Stratum port NOT accessible (connection refused from localhost)
- **PROBLEM 2**: Wallet RPC error: "Wallet file not specified (must request wallet RPC through /wallet/<filename> uri-path)"
- **PROBLEM 3**: WebServer error: "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process"
- **PROBLEM 4**: Recurring statistics error: "The method or operation is not implemented"
- **PROBLEM 5**: Storage error: "No valid storage configuration found"

❌ **Miner**: Not configured
- Wallet balance: 0 BTC (miner_wallet is empty)

## IDENTIFIED ISSUES

1. **Critical**: Pool's Stratum server is not externally accessible despite claiming to listen
2. **Critical**: Pool cannot access daemon wallet (incorrect wallet URI path)
3. **Major**: Pool's web server cannot bind (port conflict on localhost:81)
4. **Minor**: Statistics module not implemented
5. **Minor**: Storage not configured
6. **Setup Gap**: Miner not configured
7. **Setup Gap**: Wallet needs funding for mining

## DECISION LOGIC

The pool is running but has **multiple configuration errors** preventing proper operation:
- Wallet access error means pool cannot verify transactions or create payouts
- Stratum port accessibility issue means miners cannot connect
- These are **pool-specific configuration problems**, not generic errors

The pool configuration file shows it's trying to connect to daemon with credentials (`coiniumtest/testpass123`) and attempting to use a wallet address, but the daemon integration is broken.

**This is specifically a POOL configuration/integration error** requiring pool-specific troubleshooting:
- Pool-to-daemon RPC wallet path incorrect
- Stratum binding issue
- Web server port conflict
