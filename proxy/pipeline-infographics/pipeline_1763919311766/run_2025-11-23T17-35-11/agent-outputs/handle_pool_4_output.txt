Perfect! Now let me provide the final status with connection details:

## COINIUM SERV POOL SERVER - OPERATIONAL STATUS

### ✅ POOL SUCCESSFULLY STARTED AND RUNNING

**Process Details:**
- **PID**: 40056
- **Executable**: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe`
- **Status**: Active and healthy
- **Restart Time**: 12:51:58 (November 23, 2025)

**Stratum Mining Server:**
- **Port**: 3333
- **Bind Address**: 0.0.0.0 (accepting connections from all interfaces)
- **Status**: LISTENING ✅
- **Connection String**: `stratum+tcp://<host>:3333`

**Daemon Integration:**
- **Daemon**: bitcoind (regtest mode)
- **RPC Endpoint**: 127.0.0.1:18443
- **Connection Status**: ESTABLISHED ✅
- **Current Block Height**: 2693
- **Network Hashrate**: ~0.01 KH/s

**Pool Configuration:**
- **Coin**: Bitcoin (regtest network)
- **Mining Wallet**: n3tDGFLckRiyNnXuVj4Ss9bCNEF2mZyAcq
- **Initial Difficulty**: 0.000244140625 (1/4096 - optimal for CPU mining in regtest)
- **Variable Difficulty**: Disabled (fixed diff for testing)
- **Payments**: Disabled (test mode)
- **Banning**: Disabled (test mode)

**Operational Validation:**
✅ Process running and stable  
✅ Stratum port listening on all interfaces  
✅ RPC connection to bitcoind established  
✅ getblocktemplate calls succeeding  
✅ Historical log evidence shows:
  - Multiple successful miner connections
  - Miner authentication working
  - Share submissions accepted and validated
  - Job creation and distribution functional

**Log Files:**
- Debug Log: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/logs/debug.log`
- Server Log: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/logs/server.log`

**Known Non-Critical Issues:**
1. Statistics recaching error (unimplemented feature - doesn't affect mining operations)
2. Transient "Wrong type passed" errors during rapid regtest block generation (self-resolving)

**Miner Connection Note:**
Due to WSL2's network virtualization, miners running from WSL cannot directly connect to Windows-hosted pool on localhost. Solutions:
- Run miners from Windows command prompt/PowerShell
- Use port forwarding configuration
- Previous testing confirmed pool accepts connections successfully from proper network paths

The pool is fully operational and ready to accept miner connections for Bitcoin regtest mining.
