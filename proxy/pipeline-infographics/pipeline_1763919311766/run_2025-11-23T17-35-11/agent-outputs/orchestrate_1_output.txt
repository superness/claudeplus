Perfect! Now I have the complete picture:

**Infrastructure State Analysis:**
1. **Daemon (bitcoind)**: ✓ Running, RPC accessible on port 18443, wallet funded (12.5 BTC balance + 1250 BTC immature), getblocktemplate working, block height 433
2. **Pool (CoiniumServ)**: ✓ Running, Stratum listening on port 3333 (Windows side), connected to daemon (established connection visible), broadcasting jobs, has active client connection
3. **Miner**: ✗ Binary exists at /home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer but no configuration file

**Key observations:**
- All core components are operational
- Pool and daemon have established RPC connection (127.0.0.1:49673 ↔ 127.0.0.1:18443)
- Stratum is accessible on Windows (0.0.0.0:3333 listening, plus established connection to 172.22.45.9:36978)
- WSL networking shows connection refused from WSL side but Windows side shows it's listening (typical WSL2 networking behavior)
- JobManager is broadcasting new jobs to 1 subscriber
- Only missing piece: miner configuration

**What needs to be done:**
- Miner setup/configuration is the only missing component
- Then run full end-to-end validation

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✓ **Dependencies**: Installed
  - bitcoind: Running
  - CoiniumServ: Running  
  - cpuminer: Binary present at /home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer

✓ **Configurations**: Present
  - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf exists
  - Pool config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json exists
  - Pool-specific config: default.json with correct daemon RPC settings

✓ **Daemon (bitcoind)**: Fully operational
  - Process running (PID 3919)
  - RPC accessible on port 18443
  - Block height: 433
  - Wallet funded: 12.5 BTC confirmed, 1250 BTC immature
  - getblocktemplate working correctly

✓ **Pool (CoiniumServ)**: Fully operational
  - Process running (PID 50828)
  - Stratum port 3333 listening (verified on Windows side)
  - Connected to daemon via RPC (established TCP connection visible)
  - JobManager broadcasting jobs to 1 subscriber
  - Has active client connection (172.22.45.9:36978)
  - Minor statistics errors (non-critical, doesn't affect mining)

✗ **Miner**: Not configured
  - cpuminer binary exists
  - No configuration file at ~/.cpuminer-config.json
  - Needs: Stratum connection setup, wallet address configuration

**Infrastructure Gaps Identified:**
1. Miner configuration missing (only remaining gap)

**Dependencies Satisfied:**
- Daemon is running and healthy → Pool can connect ✓
- Pool is running and connected → Miner can connect (once configured)

**Next Action Required:**
Configure miner with pool connection and wallet address, then run comprehensive end-to-end validation.

DECISION: delegate_miner_setup

REASONING:
Daemon and pool are both fully operational with established connection between them. Pool is broadcasting jobs and ready to accept miner connections. The only missing component is miner configuration. Once miner is configured, we can proceed to full end-to-end validation to verify the complete mining cycle. Miner setup is the logical next step as all dependencies (daemon running, pool connected to daemon, Stratum port accessible) are satisfied.
