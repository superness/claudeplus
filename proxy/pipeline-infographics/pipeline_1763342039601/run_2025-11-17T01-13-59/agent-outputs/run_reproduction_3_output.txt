No command timeout mechanism! The script will hang forever if a response never arrives. This is a FRAMEWORK_ERROR - the testing infrastructure has multiple critical bugs:

1. **No command timeout** - Commands hang forever if no response
2. **Message routing issues** - Previous evidence shows commands echoed instead of responses
3. **Wait command format bug** - Missing `type: 'response'` wrapper
