Excellent! I now have enough information to complete the bug analysis. Let me compile the structured analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands - ship remains completely stationary despite navigation commands being set",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player double-taps/double-clicks to set a navigation target, the ship should automatically start moving toward that target at 75% speed (EVE-style autopilot)",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship receives navigation commands (target position, speedSetting=0.75, type='approach') but remains completely stationary with zero velocity and no movement",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "ship movement",
    "navigation",
    "input handling",
    "physics engine",
    "touch controls"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in a browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)",
    "Step 2: Wait for the game to fully initialize and player ship to spawn",
    "Step 3: Double-click anywhere in the game canvas (or double-tap on mobile)",
    "Step 4: Observe: Navigation target is set (console shows target coordinates and speedSetting=0.75)",
    "Step 5: Observe bug: Ship does NOT move - remains at starting position with zero velocity",
    "Step 6: Check console logs - navigation command flows through: InputManager → SpaceshipSimulator → Ship.updateWithMiningAndExploration → Ship.updateWithNavigation → ShipPhysics.updatePhysics",
    "Step 7: Bug confirmed: Despite navigationCommand being passed with speedSetting=0.75 and valid target, physics never updates ship position"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The navigation command is being correctly passed from InputManager → SpaceshipSimulator → Ship, but somewhere in the Ship.updateWithNavigation() or ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() chain, the thrustVector is not being properly calculated or applied. Based on the extensive debug logging in Ship.js (lines 203-367), there's likely a bug where:\n\n1. The thrustVector is being calculated from the navigation command (Ship.js:381-486 calculateThrustFromNavigation())\n2. But the thrustVector.magnitude may be getting lost or set to zero during object copying/spreading\n3. Or the ShipPhysics.updatePhysics() is not properly reading the thrustInput\n\nThe bug appears to be in the data flow between Ship.updateWithNavigation() → physics.updatePhysics(). The Ship class has multiple safeguards (lines 349-356, 71-77) specifically trying to preserve thrustVector.magnitude, which suggests this exact bug has been encountered before but not fully fixed.\n\nRoot cause is likely in ShipPhysics.js lines 69-89 where thrustInput is being set, or in the updateTargetVelocity() method (lines 118-149) where the magnitude might be getting lost."
