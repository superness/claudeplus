Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and looks complete. Let me verify it has all the necessary components and output my final decision:

Executes sequence: listCommands → getShipState (initial) → setNavigationTarget (5000,0,0) → wait 500ms → getShipState (check velocity) → wait 1500ms → getShipState (final check)\n6. Verifies ship velocity and movement after navigation target is set\n7. Reproduces bug if velocity < 10 m/s or distance moved < 10m after 2 seconds\n8.

  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship velocity remains < 10 m/s and distance moved < 10m after 2 seconds from setting navigation target. The script will:\n\n1. Set navigation target to (5000, 0, 0) using setNavigationTarget command\n2. Wait 500ms and check if ship velocity > 0.1 m/s (initial movement check)\n3. Wait additional 1500ms (total 2 seconds) and verify velocity > 10 m/s and distance moved > 10m\n4. If velocity is too low or ship hasn't moved, bug is reproduced\n5. Save evidence file with all state snapshots, command responses, and root cause analysis\n\nThe script uses ONLY available automation commands from GameTestingInterface.js:\n- listCommands (verification)\n- getShipState (state capture)\n- setNavigationTarget (the critical command that should trigger ship movement)\n- wait (local timing command)\n\nExit codes:\n- 0 = Bug reproduced OR bug not reproduced (test completed successfully)\n- 1 = Test failed (command error, connection error, etc.)\n\nThe script is ready to execute and will clearly demonstrate that the ship does not respond to navigation targets."
