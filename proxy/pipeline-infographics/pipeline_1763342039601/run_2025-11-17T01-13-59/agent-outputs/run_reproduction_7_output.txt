The infrastructure looks correct. The issue is that the script hangs, which means either:
1. The WebSocket connection isn't being established
2. The game isn't responding to commands

Given that the script shows "Game connected to automation server" and "Test client connected", but then hangs after sending the first command, this is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** - the automation infrastructure is failing to receive responses from the game.

Let me document the findings:

    "Previous evidence files exist from earlier runs (timestamps 1763332247053 through 1763342697872)"
  ]
}
```

**Analysis:**

The script appears to be correctly structured and follows the expected workflow:
1. ✅ WebSocket server starts on port 8765
2. ✅ Chrome launches with `?testMode=true`
3. ✅ Game connects to WebSocket server
4. ✅ Test client connects to WebSocket server
5. ❌ **First command sent but no response received**

The automation framework infrastructure is failing at the command execution/response stage. The game connects, but when commands are sent, no responses are received, causing the script to hang.

**Root cause:** WebSocket automation framework is not functioning correctly - commands are being sent but responses are not being received from the game browser instance.
