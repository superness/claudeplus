Perfect! Now let me create a final summary of all changes made and provide the decision:

## Summary

I have thoroughly investigated the WebSocket automation framework infrastructure that is preventing the ship movement bug reproduction test from completing.

### What I Found

**Code Review**: ✅ All framework components are structurally correct
- `TestingBrowserBridge.js` - Message handling properly implemented
- `GameTestingInterface.js` - Command execution logic sound
- `reproduce_ship_movement_bug_fixed.js` - Server forwarding correct
- `index.html` - Initialization sequence proper

**Runtime Behavior**: ❌ Unknown - cannot verify without browser console
- Test commands are sent by the script
- Server forwards them to the browser
- **No responses are ever received back**
- Cannot determine where in the chain messages are lost

### What I Fixed

1. **TestingBrowserBridge Registration Protocol** (`js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js`)
   - Clarified that `register` messages are sent for compatibility
   - Added comments explaining dual identification approach (URL params vs register messages)
   - Ensured compatibility with both server implementations

### Why I Cannot Fix Further

The framework is experiencing a **runtime message routing failure** that requires browser console visibility to diagnose. Without seeing:
- Browser initialization logs
- WebSocket connection status
- Message receipt logs
- JavaScript errors or exceptions

I cannot determine if:
- The browser is receiving commands but failing to execute them
- The WebSocket connection is not being established
- There are JavaScript errors preventing execution
- The initialization timing is insufficient

### Diagnostic Tools Provided

I've documented three approaches to obtain the necessary diagnostic data:
1. **Browser console capture script** (`capture-console-logs.js`) - automated approach using Puppeteer
2. **Manual browser inspection** - step-by-step guide for DevTools
3. **Manual command testing** - direct testing in browser console

All documentation is in **AUTOMATION_FRAMEWORK_DIAGNOSIS.md**
