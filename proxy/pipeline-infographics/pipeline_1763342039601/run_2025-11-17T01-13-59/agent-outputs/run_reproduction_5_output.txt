**Infrastructure Failure Analysis:**

The reproduction script encountered a critical infrastructure error:

1. **WebSocket Server**: Started successfully on port 8765
2. **Dev Server**: Confirmed running on http://localhost:8080
3. **Browser Launch**: Attempted to launch Chrome using WSL → Windows cmd.exe bridge
4. **Connection Failure**: Game briefly connected (3 connection messages) but immediately disconnected
5. **Chrome Availability**: Chrome executable not found in Windows PATH
6. **Result**: Zero automation commands executed; test infrastructure unable to maintain browser connection

**Error Classification**: This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** because the test infrastructure itself failed. The WebSocket automation system requires a functioning browser to execute commands, but the browser launch mechanism failed to establish a stable connection. Without a connected browser, no ship movement testing can occur.
