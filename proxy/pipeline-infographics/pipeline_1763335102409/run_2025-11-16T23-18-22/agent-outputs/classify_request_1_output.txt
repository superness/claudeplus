  "reasoning": "User explicitly describes this as a 'critical bug affecting core gameplay' where the ship is 'not moving at all' despite setting navigation targets. The request focuses on investigating and fixing broken functionality (ship movement) rather than adding new features or making simple changes. Key indicators include: 'not moving', 'critical bug', 'fails to move', and the systematic debugging checklist provided.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The player ship is not moving at all, even after setting navigation targets and tapping places to fly to in space. This is a critical bug affecting core gameplay. Investigate the ship movement system to identify why the ship fails to move when navigation targets are set. Check: 1) Navigation target setting logic, 2) Ship movement/physics code, 3) Input handling for tap-to-move, 4) Any conditions that might prevent movement, 5) Event listeners and state updates. Find the root cause and fix it so the ship properly moves to navigation targets when the player taps in space.",
