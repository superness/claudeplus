Perfect! Both reproduction scripts are ready. Let me create a summary document:

## ✅ Reproduction Scripts Created

I've successfully created two automated bug reproduction scripts using ChromeManager:

### 1. **WebSocket Disconnect Bug** - `test_websocket_disconnect_bug.js`

**Bug Description:** Chrome disconnects with WebSocket error code 1006 immediately after executing the setPosition/teleport command.

**Test Scenario:**
1. Get initial ship position
2. Execute teleport command to coordinates (50000, 0, 30000) - a long distance
3. Wait 2 seconds to see if WebSocket disconnects
4. Attempt to get ship state again
5. **Bug reproduced if:** WebSocket disconnects with code 1006 during the test
6. **Bug fixed if:** All commands complete successfully without disconnect

**Key Detection:** The script specifically monitors for WebSocket close event with code 1006 during test execution. If this occurs, the bug is immediately flagged as reproduced.

### 2. **Ship Fitting Auto-Fit Bug** - `test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js`

**Bug Description:** Double-clicking to auto-fit an item in the ship fitting UI causes TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hull').

**Root Cause:** Ship ID mismatch - StationUI uses 'player_ship_1' but ShipFittingManager uses 'player'.

**Test Scenario:**
1. Wait for game initialization
2. Debug environment to check station availability
3. Check for existing stations or create test station if needed
4. Teleport near station (within docking range)
5. Dock at station
6. Add Mining Laser I to inventory
7. Verify item is in inventory
8. Execute autoFitItem command (simulates double-click)
9. **Bug reproduced if:** TypeError occurs or fitting fails
10. **Bug fixed if:** Item successfully auto-fits to high slot

**Key Features:**
- Uses dynamic station detection/creation
- Handles both existing stations and test environment
- Captures console errors for TypeError detection
- Verifies final fitting state

## Running the Scripts

Both scripts use the correct ChromeManager template with proper variable naming (`testClientServer` vs `testClient`):

```bash
# Test WebSocket disconnect bug
node test_websocket_disconnect_bug.js

# Test ship fitting auto-fit bug
node test_ship_fitting_auto_fit_bug.js
```

Each script:
- ✅ Launches Chrome with correct WSL path
- ✅ Disables all cache with proper flags
- ✅ Captures and parses console logs
- ✅ Sets up WebSocket server and relay
- ✅ Handles process cleanup and PID tracking
- ✅ Saves evidence with console logs in JSON format
- ✅ Uses correct variable naming pattern from reference template

**DECISION: script_ready**
