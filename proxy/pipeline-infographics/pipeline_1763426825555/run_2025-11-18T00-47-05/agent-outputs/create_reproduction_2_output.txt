Perfect! I've created a reproduction script for the ship fitting persistence bug. However, there's an important limitation:

## Script Created: `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`

### What It Does

The script automates testing of the ship fitting system and verifies:

1. ✅ Docking at a station
2. ✅ Adding items to inventory (Mining Laser I, Afterburner I)
3. ✅ Fitting items to ship slots (high slot 0, mid slot 0)
4. ✅ Reading fitted items via `getFittedItems()`
5. ✅ Triggering manual save via `saveGame()`
6. ✅ Collecting console logs and evidence

### Critical Limitation

**The script CANNOT automatically trigger browser refresh.** There is no `reloadPage` command in the GameTestingInterface.

**Manual verification required:**
- After the automated portion completes, you must manually refresh the browser (F5)
- Then check if the fitted items are still in their slots
- The script will provide clear instructions when it reaches this point

### Test Scenario

```javascript
// Simplified flow:
1. Find and dock at station
2. Add Mining Laser I and Afterburner I to inventory
3. Fit Mining Laser I to high slot 0
4. Fit Afterburner I to mid slot 0
5. Verify items are fitted correctly
6. Trigger manual save
7. Display manual verification instructions

// Manual step (cannot be automated):
8. User refreshes browser
9. User checks if fitted items are still there
```

### Evidence Collection

The script collects:
- All command/response pairs
- Fitted items state before save
- Console logs with errors/exceptions
- Timestamps for all operations
- Save to: `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`

### Why This Approach

This is the best we can do without implementing a `reloadPage` command. The automated portion sets up the exact conditions to reproduce the bug, then requires one manual step (browser refresh) to verify persistence.

**DECISION: need_command_implementation**

The bug requires a browser page reload to fully test persistence automatically. We need to implement a `reloadPage` command in GameTestingInterface.js that can trigger a browser refresh and wait for the page to reload before continuing the test sequence.
