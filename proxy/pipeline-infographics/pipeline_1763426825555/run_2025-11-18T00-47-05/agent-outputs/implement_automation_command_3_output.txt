Now I understand the current structure of GameTestingInterface.js. The reproduction_creator is requesting a `reloadPage` command to test the ship fitting persistence bug. However, I need to carefully consider whether this is actually implementable.

**Analysis:**

A `reloadPage` command would need to:
1. Trigger a browser page reload (`location.reload()` or similar)
2. Wait for the page to fully reload
3. Continue test execution after reload

**The fundamental problem:** When a page reloads, **all JavaScript state is lost**, including:
- The WebSocket connection to the test automation client
- The test execution context
- All in-memory objects and variables

This makes a `reloadPage` command **impossible to implement** in a way that allows seamless continuation of automated tests. The test automation system would lose connection to the browser and couldn't continue the test sequence.

**Why this cannot be implemented:**
1. JavaScript execution stops when `location.reload()` is called
2. All WebSocket connections are closed
3. The test client would need to reconnect, which requires complex orchestration outside of GameTestingInterface
4. There's no way to "resume" execution after reload from within the same test script

**Alternative approaches:**
1. **Manual verification** (current approach): Automate setup, then require manual refresh
2. **Test the underlying persistence mechanism directly**: Instead of reloading, test that the save/load functions work correctly
3. **External browser automation**: Use Puppeteer/Playwright to control browser refresh (outside this system)

Let me provide a proper `cannot_implement` response:

```json
{
  "reason": "Browser page reload fundamentally breaks the test automation connection and execution context",
  "missingGameFeature": "The limitation is not in the game engine, but in the architecture of web-based test automation. When location.reload() is called, all JavaScript execution stops, WebSocket connections close, and in-memory state is lost. The test automation client cannot maintain a connection through a page reload.",
  "recommendedApproach": "There are three better approaches:\n\n1. **Current approach (Manual verification)**: Automate the setup (dock, add items, fit items, save), then provide clear instructions for manual browser refresh and verification. This is already implemented in test_ship_fitting_persistence.js.\n\n2. **Test persistence directly**: Instead of testing through browser reload, test the underlying save/load mechanism:\n   - Call saveGame() to trigger localStorage save\n   - Manually inspect localStorage to verify ship fitting data is saved\n   - Call a hypothetical loadGame() method to test restoration\n   - Verify fitted items match the original state\n   This tests the same functionality without requiring browser reload.\n\n3. **External browser automation**: Use Puppeteer or Playwright to control the browser externally. This allows the automation tool to survive page reloads by controlling the browser from outside the page context. This would be a separate testing infrastructure, not part of GameTestingInterface.\n\nRecommendation: Use approach #2 - add a 'loadGame' command to GameTestingInterface that explicitly calls the load functionality, allowing full automation without browser reload."
