Perfect! I now have enough information to provide a comprehensive bug analysis.

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship fitted items are not persisting across browser refreshes - all fitted modules are lost when page reloads",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a player fits items to their ship (e.g., Mining Laser I to high slots, Afterburner to mid slots), those fitted items should remain equipped after browser refresh. The ship fitting state should be saved to localStorage and restored on page load.",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship fitting state is saved correctly (serializeShipFitting() in SaveGameManager.js:657-709), but the fitted items are NOT being restored on page load. The deserializeShipFitting() method runs (SaveGameManager.js:713-774), but the fitted items don't appear in the ship's slots after browser refresh.",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship_fitting", "save_system", "persistence", "inventory_management"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser (http://localhost:8080/index.html)",
    "Step 2: Dock at a station and open the ship fitting interface",
    "Step 3: Fit an item to a ship slot (e.g., drag Mining Laser I to a high slot)",
    "Step 4: Verify the item appears in the slot and stats are updated correctly",
    "Step 5: Wait 30 seconds for auto-save OR manually trigger save",
    "Step 6: Refresh the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)",
    "Step 7: Observe that fitted items are gone from ship slots",
    "Step 8: Check browser console for any errors during load/restore"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/SaveGameManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The SaveGameManager.serializeShipFitting() method correctly saves fitted items to localStorage (lines 657-709). However, the restoration logic in deserializeShipFitting() (lines 713-774) may be executing BEFORE the ShipFittingManager is fully initialized, OR the item restoration loop (lines 752-766) is failing silently due to inventory state issues. The code attempts to unfit all items first (lines 740-750), then re-fit them from saved state (lines 752-766), but the fitItem() calls may be failing due to: (1) Timing issues - restoration happens before ContentManager/items are loaded, (2) Inventory state - items may not be present in playerInventory when restore runs, or (3) Order of operations - player ship may not be fully initialized when fitting restoration occurs. The deserializeShipFitting() logs 'Ship fitting configuration restored' even if individual fitItem() calls fail, masking the actual problem."
