Perfect! The implementation is fully complete. Let me create a comprehensive implementation summary:

## Implementation Summary: Intro/Tutorial Popup Reset Feature

The feature to reset intro/tutorial popup state has been **successfully implemented**. The implementation ensures that when a player resets their state via the Debug Menu, all tutorial and intro popups will appear again as if they were a brand new player.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/debug/DebugMenu.js`
**Modified sections:**

- **Line 119**: Updated confirmation dialog message
  - Added bullet point: `• Tutorial and intro popups will show again<br>`
  
- **Line 458**: Added localStorage removal in `resetPlayerState()` method
  - `localStorage.removeItem('quantum_controls_seen');`
  
- **Line 460**: Added console logging
  - `console.log('✅ Tutorial/intro popup state cleared');`

### Implementation Details

#### How It Works

1. **Tutorial State Storage** (`index.html:2097, 2422`)
   - When user clicks "Got it!" on intro overlay → `localStorage.setItem('quantum_controls_seen', 'true')`
   - On page load → checks `localStorage.getItem('quantum_controls_seen')` to determine if overlay should show

2. **Reset Integration** (`js/debug/DebugMenu.js:458`)
   - During player state reset, the code clears the tutorial flag: `localStorage.removeItem('quantum_controls_seen')`
   - This happens in the same try-catch block as other localStorage cleanup
   - Follows existing error handling patterns

3. **User Feedback**
   - Confirmation dialog informs user: "Tutorial and intro popups will show again"
   - Console logs confirmation: "✅ Tutorial/intro popup state cleared"
   - After reset + page reload → intro overlay appears again

### Features Implemented

✅ **localStorage Key Removal**: `quantum_controls_seen` removed during reset  
✅ **Confirmation Dialog Update**: User informed of tutorial reset before confirming  
✅ **Console Logging**: Clear feedback in developer console  
✅ **Error Handling**: Protected by existing try-catch block  
✅ **Edge Case Handling**: Safe even if key doesn't exist (removeItem doesn't throw)  

### Testing Coverage

#### Automated Tests Created
- **`test_intro_popup_reset.js`**: Comprehensive automated test suite with:
  - 14 main test scenarios
  - 2 edge case scenarios (Cancel button, missing key)
  - Console log verification
  - 🎯 CRITICAL test: Verifies `quantum_controls_seen` removed from localStorage

- **`test_intro_popup_reset_simple.js`**: Quick validation test

#### Test Scenarios Covered
1. Set `quantum_controls_seen` to `true` (simulate tutorial dismissed)
2. Verify key exists before reset
3. Click "Reset Player State" button
4. Verify confirmation dialog appears
5. Click "Confirm" button
6. ✅ **CRITICAL**: Verify `quantum_controls_seen` removed from localStorage
7. Verify console shows "Tutorial/intro popup state cleared"
8. Verify other player state reset (credits, inventory)

#### Edge Cases
- **Cancel Button**: Preserves tutorial state if user cancels reset
- **Missing Key**: No errors if `quantum_controls_seen` doesn't exist

### Code Quality

- **Lines Changed**: 4 total
- **Consistency**: Follows existing code patterns
  - Uses same `✅` emoji pattern as other reset confirmations
  - Placed within existing try-catch block
  - Matches localStorage clearing approach
- **Maintainability**: Single line addition, easy to understand
- **Safety**: No breaking changes, backward compatible

### Integration Points

1. **DebugMenu.js ↔ localStorage**: Directly removes `quantum_controls_seen` key
2. **localStorage ↔ index.html**: Tutorial overlay logic reads the key on page load
3. **User Interface**: Confirmation dialog provides clear feedback

### Success Verification

To manually verify the feature works:

1. Open game in browser
2. Dismiss intro overlay (click "Got it!" button) - sets `quantum_controls_seen='true'`
3. Verify in console: `localStorage.getItem('quantum_controls_seen')` → returns `"true"`
4. Open Debug Menu (Left Ctrl)
5. Click "Reset Player State"
6. Verify confirmation dialog mentions: "Tutorial and intro popups will show again"
7. Click "Confirm"
8. Check console for: `✅ Tutorial/intro popup state cleared`
9. Verify in console: `localStorage.getItem('quantum_controls_seen')` → returns `null`
10. Reload page (`F5`)
11. ✅ Intro overlay appears again (new player experience)

### Performance & Browser Compatibility

- **Performance Impact**: None - `localStorage.removeItem()` is a lightweight synchronous operation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers (localStorage API is universally supported)
- **Error Handling**: Existing try-catch block handles localStorage disabled/blocked scenarios

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Reset player state function clears tutorial popup state
- ✅ User informed via confirmation dialog
