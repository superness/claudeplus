Perfect! I've created a comprehensive automated reproduction script for the ship fitting bug. Here's what the script does:

## Script Overview

**File**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_ship_fitting_bug.js`

## Test Scenario (9 Steps)

1. **Get initial ship state** - Baseline physics values
2. **Dock at station** - Enter docked state
3. **Add afterburner to inventory** - Prepare item for fitting
4. **Fit afterburner to ship** - Execute the fitting operation
5. **Verify item is fitted** - Confirm fitting worked, check physics values
6. **Undock from station** - Exit docked state (critical step where bug occurs)
7. **Get ship state after undocking** - Check for invalid physics values (maxSpeed=0, mass=0, agility=0)
8. **Attempt navigation** - Try to move ship with setPosition command
9. **Check final ship state** - Verify if ship physics are broken

## Expected Outcome

**Bug Reproduced When:**
- Ship physics values (maxSpeed, mass, agility) become zero or invalid after undocking with fitted items
- Navigation commands fail or ship doesn't move
- Script will output: `🔴 BUG SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED`

**Bug Not Reproduced When:**
- All physics values remain valid (>0) after fitting and undocking
- Ship navigation works correctly
- Script will output: `✓ All Test Steps Completed - Bug NOT reproduced`

## Evidence Files

The script saves comprehensive evidence to:
- **Path**: `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/evidence_ship_fitting_bug.json`
- **Contains**: Full test results, physics values at each step, root cause analysis

## Command Sequence

```json
[
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Returns valid initial state"},
  {"command": "dock", "expectedResult": "Successfully docks at station"},
  {"command": "addResource", "params": {"resourceType": "afterburner", "amount": 1}, "expectedResult": "Adds afterburner to inventory"},
  {"command": "fitItem", "params": {"itemId": "afterburner"}, "expectedResult": "Fits afterburner to ship"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Afterburner in fitted items list"},
  {"command": "undock", "expectedResult": "Successfully undocks"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Physics values still valid (BUG: they become zero)"},
  {"command": "setPosition", "params": {"x": 1000, "y": 1000}, "expectedResult": "Ship moves (BUG: navigation broken)"},
  {"command": "getShipState", "expectedResult": "Final state has valid physics (BUG: maxSpeed/mass/agility = 0)"}
]
```

## How to Execute

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests
node reproduce_ship_fitting_bug.js
```

The script will:
1. Launch Chrome with the game in test mode
2. Wait 5 seconds for game to load
3. Connect to WebSocket on port 8765
4. Execute all 9 test steps
5. Save evidence to JSON file
6. Exit with code 0 (bug reproduced) or 1 (test failed)
