  "actualBehavior": "After fitting items and undocking, the ship is completely frozen - cannot generate thrust, navigation commands don't work, clicking/double-clicking objects has no effect. All movement and control systems are non-functional",

  "hypothesis": "The ship fitting save/restore mechanism is likely overwriting or corrupting the ship's physics properties, control state, or movement parameters when items are fitted. Possible causes: (1) Ship fitting manager may be incorrectly serializing/deserializing ship state, (2) Fitting process may be disabling physics engine or movement controls, (3) Ship properties (mass, agility, maxVelocity) may be set to zero or invalid values, (4) Event listeners or input handlers may be disconnected during fitting process, (5) Ship instance may be replaced/recreated incorrectly when undocking with fitted items"
