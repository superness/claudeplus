Now I have a complete picture of the implementation status. Let me provide my feature selection assessment.

## Next Feature: Items/Loot System

### Already Implemented

1. **Player character** ✓ - Full Player.ts with movement, skills, stats
2. **Basic map/world** ✓ - World.ts with tile-based environment, lighting, fog
3. **Collision** ✓ - CollisionSystem.ts with wall blocking and sliding
4. **Enemy spawning** ✓ - EntityManager + EnemyTemplates with 5 factions
5. **Basic combat** ✓ - Full CombatManager/CombatValidator/CombatSystem with 8 damage types, 36+ skills
6. **Health/death** ✓ - HP system, enemy death handling, player takeDamage/heal
7. **UI elements** ✓ - Full UI.ts with SkillBar (8+1), health/energy bars, target frame, chat, party frames
8. **Skills system** ✓ - GW1-style skill bar with level unlocking (4→8 slots), skill trees, secondary profession
9. **Classes** ✓ - 12 classes across 3 factions with unique skills
10. **Companions/Henchmen** ✓ - Full PartyManager with henchmen/heroes, AI system, party composition rules
11. **Tactical Missions** ✓ - TacticalMission.ts with wave-based combat, 4 difficulties

### Why This Feature

Looking at the priority list, features 1-9 plus companions and missions are done. The **Items/Loot system** is the natural next step because:

1. Enemies die but drop nothing - kills feel unrewarding
2. The MissionReward interface already references `'ITEM'` type rewards
3. Combat is complete but has no progression reward loop
4. Backend already has `item.ts` model and `inventory.api.ts`

The loot system would:
- Make enemy kills satisfying with drops
- Connect to the existing reward system in TacticalMission
- Enable gear-based character progression
- Lead naturally into Inventory (feature 11) and Economy (feature 12)
