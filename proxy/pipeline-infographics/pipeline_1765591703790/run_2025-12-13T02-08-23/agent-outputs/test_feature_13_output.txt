Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile my test results.

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**FAIL** - Client has TypeScript compilation errors

**Client Errors (15 errors):**
- `client/src/game/companions/index.ts`: 14 type export errors (need `export type` for type-only exports when `isolatedModules` is enabled)
- `client/src/game/missions/TacticalMission.ts:327`: Possible undefined access on `currentPhase.objective.target`

**Server Build:** PASS ✓

### Integration Path Verification

#### 1. Combat: Player.useSkill() → CombatSystem → Enemy.takeDamage()
- **Entry point**: `Player.useSkill(slotIndex)` at `client/src/game/entities/Player.ts:274`
- **Calls**: Triggers cooldown, deducts energy locally
- **CombatSystem import in Game.ts**: **NO** - CombatSystem is NOT imported or instantiated in Game.ts
- **CombatSystem import in Player.ts**: **NO** - Player does not import CombatSystem
- **Connection to Enemy.takeDamage()**: **NO** - Player.useSkill() does not call any combat system or damage method
- **CONNECTED: NO** ❌

**Critical Finding**: The `CombatSystem` class exists in `client/src/combat/CombatSystem.ts` but is **never instantiated or connected** in the main game. `Player.useSkill()` only:
1. Checks cooldown
2. Triggers cooldown timer
3. Deducts energy
4. Logs to console

It does NOT:
- Import CombatSystem
- Call any damage calculation
- Apply damage to selected enemy
- Send skill use to server

#### 2. Movement: InputManager → Player.setMoveDirection() → Player.update()
- **Entry point**: `InputManager.update()` at `client/src/game/input/InputManager.ts:253`
- **Calls**: `this.player.setMoveDirection(x, z)`
- **Reaches target**: Player.updateMovement() applies collision and moves position
- **CONNECTED: YES** ✓

#### 3. Targeting: Click/Tab → EntityManager.selectEnemy() → Player target
- **Entry point**: `InputManager.handleKeyDown()` Tab key at line 122
- **Calls**: `this.entityManager.cycleTarget(forward)`
- **Reaches target**: EntityManager.selectEnemy() is called, updates UI
- **CONNECTED: YES** ✓

#### 4. Collision: Player.updateMovement() → CollisionSystem.resolveCollision()
- **Entry point**: `Player.updateMovement()` at line 328
- **Calls**: `this.collisionSystem.resolveCollision()` at line 395
- **Reaches target**: CollisionSystem applied, position adjusted
- **CONNECTED: YES** ✓

#### 5. CombatValidation → Skill Execution
- **Entry point**: CombatValidator.validateSkillUse() exists in `CombatValidation.ts`
- **Calls**: Not called from anywhere - `combatValidator` singleton created but never used
- **CONNECTED: NO** ❌

### Disconnected Systems Found

1. **CombatSystem** (`client/src/combat/CombatSystem.ts`)
   - Class is defined with full damage calculation, status effects, armor penetration
   - **Never imported or instantiated in Game.ts or anywhere else**
   - Never connected to Player.useSkill()
   - `dealDamage()` method exists but is never called

2. **CombatValidator** (`client/src/combat/CombatValidation.ts`)
   - Full validation system exists (range, LoS, energy, cooldowns, status effects)
   - Singleton `combatValidator` is exported
   - **Never imported or used anywhere**

3. **Player.useSkill() is a stub**
   - Logs to console but does not:
     - Validate skill use
     - Apply damage to targets
     - Communicate with server
     - Use CombatSystem

4. **Enemy.takeDamage()** - Method does NOT exist
   - Enemy class has `updateFromNetwork()` for health updates from server
   - No local `takeDamage()` method for client-side combat

---

### Placeholder Code Found

1. **Player.useSkill()** - Placeholder skill implementation
   - Energy cost is hardcoded (`10 + slotIndex * 2`)
   - No actual skill execution

2. **Enemy AI** - Enemies don't move or attack
   - No AI behavior system implemented on client
   - Enemies just stand still with visual updates

3. **NetworkManager** - Skill messages not sent
   - Player skill usage doesn't send to server

---

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL (Integration Failures):**
1. **CombatSystem not connected** - Skills don't deal damage to enemies
2. **CombatValidator not used** - No skill validation before use
3. **Player → Enemy damage path broken** - No way for player skills to affect enemy health on client

**HIGH (Build Errors):**
4. Client build fails with 15 TypeScript errors in companions/index.ts and TacticalMission.ts

**MEDIUM:**
5. Skills panel exists but skills don't actually work
6. Enemy health bars update from server but no local combat
