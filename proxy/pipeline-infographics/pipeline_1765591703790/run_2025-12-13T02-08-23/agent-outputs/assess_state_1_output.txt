## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - A Three.js-based 3D game client with Vite build system
- **Design docs**:
  - `combat-design.md` - Comprehensive combat system (damage types, classes, skills, enemies, loot)
  - `balance-analysis.md`
  - `progression-design.md`
  - `engagement-analysis.md`
  - `systems-integration.md`
  - `emergence-analysis.md`
  - `balance-audit.md`
  - `player-experience.md`
  - `data-model.md`
  - `api-specification.md`
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express API server with:
  - Authentication (JWT + refresh tokens)
  - Character models with factions (Imperial, Tau, Ork) and classes
  - Combat service, skill system, economy service
  - WebSocket combat handlers
  - PostgreSQL repositories
- **Client code**: Three.js client with:
  - 3D third-person camera system
  - Player entity, Enemy entities with templates
  - Combat system (damage types, status effects, armor penetration)
  - Skill bar UI (Guild Wars 1 style - 8 slots + 1 elite)
  - Input management (WASD movement, tab targeting)
  - Entity management, collision system
  - Network manager for API/WebSocket
- **Can run**: Yes - `npm run dev` for backend, `npm run dev` in `/client` for frontend

## Recommendation

The client already exists and has substantial implementation. The foundation is solid with:
- Working 3D renderer with Guild Wars 1-style camera
- Combat system implementing the design docs
- Skill bar UI, targeting system, status effects
- Demo enemies spawning from all factions

You mentioned "combat needs more validation" - this is where we should continue. We can start implementing features to improve combat validation, add the henchmen/heroes system you mentioned, and expand on the enemy threat classifications (minoris, majoris, extremis, terminus with white/blue/yellow/purple indicators).
