### Why This Feature
The user explicitly mentioned "Henchman fit in perfectly to the 40k system" and emphasized wanting GW1-style gameplay with "henchmen\heroes". Looking at the combat validation request, the client has no AI party members to validate combat interactions with. Henchmen/Heroes are core to GW1's gameplay and would provide:
1. Party-based tactical combat (perfect for 40K squad tactics)
2. Testing ground for combat validation (heal allies, buff party, etc.)
3. The "small tactical missions on rails" experience with a squad
