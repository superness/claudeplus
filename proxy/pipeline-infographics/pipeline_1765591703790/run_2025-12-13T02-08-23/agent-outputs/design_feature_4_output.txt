I've created a comprehensive Henchmen/Heroes system design document that integrates perfectly with the existing Guild Wars 1-inspired game design. Here's a summary of the key design decisions:

## Design Summary

**Core System:**
- **Henchmen**: Free, fixed-build AI companions at 70% player effectiveness (18 total, 6 per faction)
- **Heroes**: Unlockable, fully customizable AI companions at 90% effectiveness (12+ total, 4 per faction)
- Both fill party slots, enabling solo players to tackle group content

**Key Integration Points:**
- Party slots expand to support henchmen/heroes (1 player + 3 AI = full party)
- SEPARATE from the existing 2+1 summon system (heroes are party members, not pets)
- Full loot goes to players only - no sharing with AI
- Heroes maintain the "build matters" philosophy with customizable 8-skill bars

**Enemy Threat Classifications (as requested):**
- **Minoris (WHITE)**: Cannon fodder (80-150 HP) - gretchin, cultists
- **Majoris (BLUE)**: Standard troops (180-350 HP) - guardsmen, fire warriors
- **Extremis (YELLOW)**: Elite enemies (400-800 HP) - space marines, crisis suits
- **Terminus (PURPLE)**: Bosses (2,000-8,000 HP) - daemon princes, warbosses
- **Apex (GOLD)**: Raid bosses (8,000-20,000+ HP) - titans, gargants

**Tactical Missions ("Murder Runs"):**
- Wave-based linear content with 60-100 enemies per mission
- Perfect for solo + henchmen/heroes gameplay
- 20-90 minute completion times depending on difficulty

**Faction-Specific Mechanics:**
- Imperial: Faith generation, Martyrdom synergies, Tech-Priest summon stacking
- Tau: Unity bonuses, Markerlight coordination, Drone swarm heroes
- Ork: WAAAGH! energy proximity bonuses, "Da Mob Rule" (+10% damage with 3+ Orks)
