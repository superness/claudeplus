The first skill (slot 0) is "Holy Strike" with range 2 (melee). The test expects to use slot 0 on an enemy at distance ~4.24 units. This is the range validation working correctly - the test setup is wrong.

## Integration Test Results

### Infrastructure Used
Playwright E2E tests with test-hooks.ts

### Tests Run

|------|--------|
| Game initializes with test hooks available | **PASS** |
| Player starts with valid health and energy | **PASS** |
| Can spawn a test enemy | **PASS** |
| Can select an enemy as target | **PASS** |
| Skill deals damage to selected enemy | **FAIL** |
| Skill triggers cooldown after use | **FAIL** |
| Cannot use skill while on cooldown | **FAIL** |
| Enemy can be killed by repeated damage | **FAIL** (timeout) |
| Combat log records damage events | **FAIL** |
| Multiple enemies can be spawned and targeted | **FAIL** |
| Minoris enemies have lower health than majoris | **PASS** |
| Different faction enemies can be spawned | **PASS** |

**Results: 6 passed, 6 failed**

### Issues Found

**Root Cause: Test setup spawns enemies OUT OF RANGE**

The tests spawn enemies at positions like (3,3), (5,5) which are:
- Distance from player at (0,0): √(3² + 3²) ≈ 4.24 units
- Skill slot 0 ("Holy Strike") has range: 2 (melee)
- **Combat validation correctly rejects**: "Target is out of range"

This is NOT a bug in the combat system - the validation is working correctly. The test setup needs to spawn enemies closer (within range 2).

**Evidence from test failures:**
1. `skill deals damage to selected enemy`: `result.success` is `false` because skill failed validation (out of range)
2. `skill triggers cooldown`: Cooldown is 0 because skill never executed (failed validation)
3. `cannot use skill while on cooldown`: First skill use failed, so no cooldown was set
4. All combat tests fail for the same underlying reason

**The Combat System is WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Range validation works ✓
- Skill slots equip correctly ✓
- Enemy spawning works ✓
- Targeting works ✓
- Health/energy tracking works ✓

**Tests need to be fixed to spawn enemies within melee range** (position like (1, 0, 1) instead of (3, 0, 3))
