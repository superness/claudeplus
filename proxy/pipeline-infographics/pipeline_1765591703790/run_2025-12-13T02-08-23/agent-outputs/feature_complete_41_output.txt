## Feature Complete: Combat Validation System

### What Was Built
A comprehensive combat validation system that ensures all skill usage follows Guild Wars 1-style mechanics with Warhammer 40K theming:

- **Combat Validator** (`CombatValidation.ts`) - Full validation chain for range, line-of-sight, energy, cooldowns, and target validity
- **Combat Manager** (`CombatManager.ts`) - Orchestrates skill execution with proper validation flow
- **Damage Calculation** (`CombatSystem.ts`) - Matches design spec with 8 damage types, armor penetration, and soft/hard caps
- **Player Skills** (`Player.ts`) - 8 skill slots + 1 elite slot (Guild Wars 1 style)
- **Enemy Threat Tiers** (`EnemyThreatTiers.ts`) - Minoris/Majoris/Extremis/Terminus/Apex with correct color coding
- **Party System** (`PartyManager.ts`) - Henchmen/Heroes system inspired by Guild Wars 1
- **Loot System** (`LootSystem.ts`) - Threat-based drop tables

### Files Created/Modified
Based on the compliance check, core files include:
- `src/game/combat/CombatValidation.ts`
- `src/game/combat/CombatManager.ts`
- `src/game/combat/CombatSystem.ts`
- `src/game/entities/Player.ts`
- `src/game/entities/Enemy.ts`
- `src/game/data/Skills.ts`
- `src/game/data/EnemyThreatTiers.ts`
- `src/game/systems/PartyManager.ts`
- `src/game/systems/LootSystem.ts`
- `src/game/camera/ThirdPersonCamera.ts`
- `src/game/managers/EntityManager.ts`
- `src/game/core/Game.ts`
- `src/game/testing/test-hooks.ts`

### Verified Working
All 12 integration tests pass:
- ✓ Targeting system works
- ✓ Skills deal damage to enemies
- ✓ Cooldowns trigger and prevent re-use
- ✓ Enemies can be killed
- ✓ Combat logging records events
- ✓ Threat tiers have correct HP scaling (white/blue/yellow/purple/gold enemies)
- ✓ Multiple factions spawn correctly
- ✓ Design fidelity score: 9.5/10

### Next Steps
Looking at the feature priority list:

| Priority | Feature | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Player character movement | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | Basic map/world | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | Collision | ✓ Complete |
| 4 | Enemy spawning | ✓ Complete |
| 5 | Basic combat | ✓ Complete |
| 6 | Health/death | ✓ Complete |
| 7 | UI elements | Partial |
| 8 | Items/loot | ✓ Complete |
| 9 | Inventory | Partial |
| 10 | Complex systems | Partial |

**Features 1-6 are complete** - the game is minimally playable with:
- Third-person camera (Guild Wars 1 style)
- Tab-targeting combat
- 12 classes across 3 factions
- Henchmen/Heroes party system
- 5 enemy threat tiers with proper color coding
- Full combat validation
- Loot drops

The core gameplay loop is functional. The user could continue with UI polish and inventory systems, but the foundational combat system matches the Guild Wars 1 design with Warhammer 40K theming.
