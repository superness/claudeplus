Based on my comprehensive search of all design documentation, I need to provide my findings:

## Design Requirements Extraction: Henchmen/Heroes System

### Search Results Summary

I searched the following design documents:
- `design-docs/api-specification.md` - Comprehensive API spec (2358 lines)
- `design-docs/balance-audit.md` - Class balance analysis (866 lines)
- `design-docs/combat-design.md` - Combat mechanics and skills
- `design-docs/emergence-analysis.md` - Emergent gameplay systems

### Findings

**NO DESIGN DOCUMENTATION EXISTS** for the Henchmen/Heroes system.

### Related Systems That DO Exist:

1. **Party Management** (API spec)
   - 4-player party maximum
   - Party creation, invites, kick functionality
   - Party chat and coordination

2. **Ally-Targeting Skills** (Combat design)
   - Healing allies (e.g., "Repair: Heal self or ally 100 HP")
   - Resurrection ("Revive ally 50% HP")
   - Damage redirection ("Redirect 50% ally damage")
   - These are PLAYER skills targeting other PLAYERS

3. **Summon System** (Emergence analysis)
   - Maximum 8 combat summons per 4-player party
   - 2 combat + 1 utility summon per player
   - These are PETS, not henchmen/heroes

### What Needs Design Documentation:

The Henchmen/Heroes system requires design specs for:

1. **Henchmen** (fixed-build AI companions)
   - Available henchmen per faction/area
   - Fixed skill bars and attributes
   - Recruitment mechanics
   - Cost structure (free vs hired)

2. **Heroes** (customizable AI companions)
   - Unlock/acquisition methods
   - Player-controlled skill bars
   - Attribute point allocation
   - Equipment systems

3. **AI Behavior**
   - Combat targeting priorities
   - Skill usage logic
   - Positioning and movement
   - Threat response

4. **Party Integration**
   - Henchmen/Heroes count toward party size?
   - Mixed player + AI party compositions
   - Scaling for solo vs group content

**DECISION: needs_design**

**Feature requiring design:** Henchmen/Heroes System

**Reason:** The user explicitly requested Guild Wars 1-style Henchmen/Heroes as AI-controlled party members, but no design documentation exists for this feature. The existing ally skills and summon systems are for player-to-player interactions and pet management, not persistent AI party members with their own skill bars.
