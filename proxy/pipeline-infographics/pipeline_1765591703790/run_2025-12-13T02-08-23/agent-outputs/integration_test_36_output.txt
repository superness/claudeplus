### Issues Found

**Test Issue (not game bug):** `combat.spec.ts:308` - "multiple enemies can be spawned and targeted"

The test fails because it uses any available skill (slot 0-7) to attack enemies. However, **slot 1 is Shield of Faith** - a self-targeted buff skill (`targetType: 'SELF'`) that doesn't deal damage to enemies.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Enemy 1: Holy Strike (slot 0, targetType: ENEMY) → 120 → 50 HP ✅
Enemy 2: Shield of Faith (slot 1, targetType: SELF) → 120 → 120 HP ❌ 
Enemy 3: Righteous Fury (slot 2, targetType: CONE) → 120 → 69 HP ✅
```

**Fix Required:** The test at `client/tests/combat.spec.ts:343-361` should filter for damage-dealing skills only (skills with `targetType: 'ENEMY'`, `'CONE'`, `'PBAE'`, `'GROUND'`) instead of trying any ready skill.

### Combat System Verdict

✅ **Combat validation is working correctly.** The game properly:
- Spawns enemies of multiple factions and threat tiers
- Selects and targets enemies
- Validates skill use (cooldowns, energy, range)
- Applies damage to enemies
- Tracks combat events in log
- Kills enemies via repeated attacks
- Differentiates skill types (damage vs self-buffs)

The failing test is a **test logic issue**, not a game bug. The test needs to use damage-dealing skills, not self-buffs.
