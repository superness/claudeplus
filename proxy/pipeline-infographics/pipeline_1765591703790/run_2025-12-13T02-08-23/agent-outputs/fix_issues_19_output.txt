Confirmed. The tests at lines 77-110 (`can spawn a test enemy` and `can select an enemy as target`) only test spawning and targeting - they don't try to use skills, so they don't need melee range and already passed.

All the combat tests that use skills have been fixed. Here's a summary:

## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Tests spawn enemies out of skill range
- **File:** `client/tests/combat.spec.ts`
- **Root cause:** Tests were spawning enemies at positions like (3, 3), (5, 5) which are 4.24+ units away from the player at (0, 0). The first skill (Holy Strike, slot 0) has melee range of 2, so combat validation correctly rejected skill use with "Target is out of range".
- **Fix:** Changed enemy spawn positions to be within melee range (distance < 2):

| Test | Old Position | New Position | Distance |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `skill deals damage to selected enemy` | (3, 3) | (1, 1) | √2 ≈ 1.4 |
| `skill triggers cooldown after use` | (3, 3) | (1, 1) | √2 ≈ 1.4 |
| `cannot use skill while on cooldown` | (3, 3) | (1, 1) | √2 ≈ 1.4 |
| `enemy can be killed by repeated damage` | (2, 2) | (1, 0) | 1 |
| `combat log records damage events` | (3, 3) | (1, 1) | √2 ≈ 1.4 |
| `multiple enemies can be spawned and targeted` | (5,5), (7,5), (9,5) | (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) | 1, 1, 1.4 |

The combat system's range validation was working correctly - the test setup was the issue, not the code.
