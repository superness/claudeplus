### Implementation Checklist Review

The extracted checklist is comprehensive and includes all key implementation tasks:
- Core loot system with proper drop rates
- Enemy-based drop tables by threat tier
- Item instance creation with stat rolls
- Drop visualization with proper color coding
- Material tier progression
- Currency drops with difficulty multipliers
- Integration points with combat and inventory systems

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements accurately capture the design intent with specific numbers, mechanics, and integration points. No generic placeholders were substituted for designed specifics. The color-coding system (white/blue/yellow/purple/gold for threat tiers, and white→green→blue→purple→orange→gold for item tiers) is correctly documented for client implementation.
