### Combat Validation Verified

2. **Skill Execution** - Skills properly deal damage to selected targets
3. **Cooldown System** - Skills go on cooldown after use and cannot be re-used until ready
4. **Damage Calculation** - Enemy health decreases when skills hit
5. **Death System** - Enemies can be killed by accumulated damage
6. **Combat Logging** - Damage events are properly recorded
7. **Multi-target Combat** - Multiple enemies can be engaged sequentially
8. **Enemy Threat Tiers** - Minoris (white) enemies have less HP than Majoris (blue) enemies
9. **Faction Variety** - Imperial, Tau, Ork, Chaos, and Tyranid enemies all spawn correctly

### Issues Found
**None** - All combat validation systems are working correctly.
