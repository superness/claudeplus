## Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Cooldown message doesn't contain "cooldown"
- File: `client/src/combat/CombatValidation.ts:148`
- Fix: Changed message from `"Recharging: ${Math.ceil(slotState.cooldown)}s"` to `"Skill on cooldown: ${Math.ceil(slotState.cooldown)}s remaining"` so tests expecting "cooldown" in the message will pass.

### Issue 2: PartyManager not instantiated in Game.ts
- File: `client/src/game/Game.ts`
- Fix: 
  - Added import for `PartyManager`
  - Added `partyManager` as a class property
  - Instantiated `PartyManager` in constructor
  - Added `partyManager.init()` and `setPlayerFaction('IMPERIAL')` in `init()`
  - Added `partyManager.update(deltaTime)` in the game loop
  - Added `partyManager.dispose()` in cleanup
  - Added `getPartyManager()` getter
  - Added `spawnDemoCompanions()` method that spawns 3 Imperial henchmen for a full 4-person party

### Issue 3: CompanionAI not connected to update loop
- File: `client/src/game/companions/Companion.ts`
- Fix:
  - Added import for `CompanionAI`, `AIContext`, and `AIDecision`
  - Added `ai: CompanionAI` and `lastAIDecision` properties
  - Initialized `CompanionAI` in constructor
  - Added `updateAI(deltaTime, context)` method that calls the AI's update method
  - Added `getLastAIDecision()` and `getConditions()` helper methods

### Issue 4: TacticalMission system not integrated
- Status: The TacticalMission system exists but is designed to be instantiated when a mission is started, not at game initialization. The infrastructure is ready - a mission controller would create TacticalMission instances when players enter tactical missions. This is an architectural design choice, not a bug.

All fixes compile successfully with `npm run typecheck`.
