The client scaffolding is complete. Here's a summary:

## What the User Requested
- A **simple tic-tac-toe game** with **spectacular super graphics**
- Build the "Super Tic Tac Toe" game using the design documents

## What I Learned from the Design Docs
The design docs describe **"Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid"** - a visually spectacular take on classic tic-tac-toe featuring:
- **Two factions**: Orbis (azure/blue, defensive, O) and Crucia (crimson/red, aggressive, X)
- **Five AI tiers**: Void Novice (90% win), Echoing Acolyte (70%), Grid Walker (50%), Force Adept (perfect), The Eternal (unbeatable)
- **Spectacular visual effects**: Victory Cascade (energy beams), Stalemate Storm (dual-force explosion), particle effects on every placement
- **Resource system**: Cosmic Essence, Starlight Orbs, Shadow Shards
- **Pure 2D gameplay** with a 3x3 cosmic grid suspended in the void

## Framework Choice
**HTML5 Canvas + Vanilla JavaScript** - No heavy framework needed because:
1. The game is fundamentally 2D (a 3x3 grid)
2. The "spectacular graphics" are particle effects (best done with Canvas 2D API)
3. User explicitly requested "simple tic tac toe"
4. No 3D games (like Guild Wars) were referenced - purely 2D cosmic visuals
5. Web Audio API for synthesized cosmic sound effects
