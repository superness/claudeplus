Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the design documents and the current implementation. Let me provide my review.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

The extracted requirements accurately reflect the original design documents:

1. **Core Gameplay (combat-design.md)**: Correctly extracted
   - Turn-based strategic duel, 2 players
   - 3x3 grid with alignment detection
   - 5-9 turns match duration
   - Cell strategic values (Center=3, Corner=2, Edge=1)

2. **Two Factions (culture-design.md)**: Correctly extracted
   - Orbis: Azure, silver, flowing animations, defensive philosophy
   - Crucia: Crimson, gold, angular animations, aggressive philosophy

3. **Five AI Tiers (combat-design.md)**: Correctly extracted with exact specs
   - Tier 1-5 with behavior, win rate targets, and reward multipliers (0.5×-2.0×)

4. **Visual Spectacle System (combat-design.md, geography-design.md)**: Correctly extracted
   - Symbol placement animations (5-step sequences for both O and X)
   - Victory cascade (6-step sequence with exact timings)
   - Stalemate storm sequence (5-step sequence)
   - Weather states (Calm Void → Rising Tension → Energy Storm)

5. **Resource System (resource-design.md)**: Correctly extracted
   - Cosmic Essence: 100/75/50 for win/draw/loss
   - Faction currencies: 20 Orbs/Shards for victory
   - Streak rewards: 1 VF at 3-win, 3 VF at 5-win, 10 VF at 10-win

6. **Implementation Status**: The client already exists at `client/index.html` with:
   - Faction selection (Orbis/Crucia)
   - All 5 AI difficulty tiers
   - Resource display (Essence, Orbs, Shards)
   - Game canvas for visual effects
   - Result overlay with rewards

### Confirmed Scope Interpretation

The previous stage correctly identified that the user's vision ("simple tic-tac-toe game with spectacular super graphics") maps to **Phase 1: Core Experience (MVP)** from systems-integration.md:
- Core 3x3 grid gameplay
- Basic visual spectacle
- Essential economy
- Minimum progression

The extensive Phase 2-4 features (skill trees, prestige, trading, events) are **post-MVP** and NOT required for this build.

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements capture the design intent accurately. The client HTML structure is already in place. Implementation should complete the JavaScript modules (particles.js, audio.js, ai.js, game.js, main.js) with the documented specifications.
