All files are fully implemented with substantial code. The client is complete. Let me verify all the requirements from the review stage are implemented:

## Implemented

The "Super Tic Tac Toe" game (titled "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid") is **already fully implemented** with all Phase 1 MVP features:

### Core Implementation:
1. **3x3 Grid Gameplay** - Full turn-based strategic duel system
2. **Two Factions** - Orbis (O, Azure, defensive) and Crucia (X, Crimson, aggressive)
3. **5 AI Tiers** with documented behaviors and reward multipliers:
   - Void Novice: Random moves, 0.5× rewards
   - Echoing Acolyte: Blocks wins, 0.75× rewards  
   - Grid Walker: Strategic center/corners, 1.0× rewards
   - Force Adept: Perfect minimax AI, 1.5× rewards
   - The Eternal: Unbeatable minimax, 2.0× rewards
4. **Visual Spectacle System** - Particle effects, symbol animations, victory cascades, stalemate storms
5. **Resource Economy** - Cosmic Essence, Starlight Orbs, Shadow Shards with correct reward values
6. **Audio System** - Procedural Web Audio effects for placement, victory, defeat, UI

## Design Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Orbis: Azure, silver, flowing animations" | Colors `#00d4ff`/`#0080ff`, circular O symbol with orbital particle ring animation |
| "Crucia: Crimson, gold, angular animations" | Colors `#ff3366`/`#ff6600`, X symbol with spark effects at corners |
| "5 AI tiers with 0.5×-2.0× multipliers" | All 5 implemented: `AI_TIERS` object with exact multipliers |
| "100/75/50 Essence for win/draw/loss" | `addRewards(100, 20)` for win, `addRewards(75, 10)` for draw, `addRewards(50, 5)` for loss |
| "20 Orbs/Shards for victory" | Faction currency awarded with difficulty multiplier |
| "Victory cascade 6-step sequence" | `victoryCascade()` with energy beams, central explosion, pulsing rings |
| "Stalemate storm" | `stalemateTempest()` with dual spiral explosion and balanced energy waves |
| "Cell strategic values (Center=3)" | Grid Walker AI prioritizes center, then corners, then edges |

## Files Modified

None - the client is already complete. The existing files implement all requirements:
- `client/index.html` - 137 lines
- `client/css/styles.css` - 563 lines
- `client/js/particles.js` - 493 lines
- `client/js/audio.js` - 185 lines
- `client/js/ai.js` - 251 lines
- `client/js/game.js` - 513 lines
- `client/js/main.js` - 389 lines

**Total: 2,531 lines of fully functional code**

## How to Test

1. Open `client/index.html` in a browser
2. Select a faction (Orbis or Crucia)
3. Select an AI opponent (Void Novice recommended for first game)
4. Click "BEGIN THE RITUAL"
5. Click cells to place your symbol
6. Watch the spectacular visual effects on placement and game end
7. Verify resources accumulate correctly based on outcome and AI multiplier
