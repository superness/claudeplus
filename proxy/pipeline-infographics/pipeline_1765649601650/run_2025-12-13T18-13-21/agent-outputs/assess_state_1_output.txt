## Current State

- **Client exists**: **NO** - There is no HTML game client (no index.html, no Phaser/game.js, no public/ folder, no client/ folder)
- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation exists in `output/design-docs/`:
  - lore-design.md, geography-design.md, culture-design.md
  - resource-design.md, economy-design.md, economy-simulation.md
  - combat-design.md, balance-analysis.md, balance-audit.md
  - progression-design.md, engagement-analysis.md
  - systems-integration.md, emergence-analysis.md
  - player-experience.md, data-model.md, api-specification.md
- **Backend code**: A full Node.js/Express backend API exists in `output/src/`:
  - Models: Player, Match, CosmeticItem, Achievement, SkillTree, PlayerProgress, PlayerWallet
  - Services: AuthService, GameService, EconomyService, ProgressionService, TradingService
  - API Routes: auth, game, economy, progression, cosmetics, trading
  - Data layer: Repository pattern with PostgreSQL
  - Tests: models.test.js, services.test.js, api.test.js
- **Can run**: **NO** - The backend is a REST API requiring PostgreSQL and Redis, but there is no playable game client. Users cannot see or interact with the game.

## Recommendation

The project has a comprehensive backend API and extensive design documentation, but **no game client exists**. Users cannot actually play "Super Tic Tac Toe" because there's no frontend - no HTML canvas, no game rendering, no UI for making moves. The backend is ready to support a client, but the client itself needs to be built.

We need to set up the game client first with:
1. An HTML5 canvas-based game interface
2. The "spectacular super graphics" the user requested
3. A 3x3 tic-tac-toe board with visual effects
4. Integration with the existing backend API
