Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the design documents. Based on the previous stage's analysis, the game is **feature-complete** for a simple tic-tac-toe game with spectacular super graphics. Let me document what requirements have been extracted and what the current implementation status is.

## Feature: Complete Game Implementation Review

### Design Documentation Status: COMPREHENSIVE

The design documents provide extensive specifications for "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid" - a simple tic-tac-toe game with spectacular super graphics.

### Specifications from Design Docs

#### Core Gameplay (from combat-design.md)
> "Combat Type: Turn-Based Strategic Duel"
> "System: Synchronous turn-based with alternating control"
> "Players: 2 (Orbis channeler vs. Crucia channeler)"
> "Objective: Align three symbols in any row, column, or diagonal"
> "Match Duration: 5-9 turns (minimum 5 moves for a victory, maximum 9 for a draw)"

**Grid Strategic Values:**
> "| Center (1,1) | Highest—connects to all lines | Nexus Core |"
> "| Corners (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2) | High—two potential alignments each | Anchor Points |"
> "| Edges (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) | Medium—one potential alignment each | Bridge Cells |"

#### Two Factions (from culture-design.md)
**Orbis (O):**
> "Philosophy: Cycles, completion, eternal return"
> "Visual Theme: Glowing azure rings, stellar halos, planetary orbits"
> "Colors: Azure, silver, soft white, deep space blue"
> "Animations: Flowing, circular, wavelike"

**Crucia (X):**
> "Philosophy: Intersection, decisive action, transformation"
> "Visual Theme: Crimson slashes, crossing energy beams, explosive marks"
> "Colors: Crimson, gold, orange, ember red"
> "Animations: Sharp, angular, impact-driven"

#### Five AI Difficulty Tiers (from combat-design.md)
> "**Tier 1: Void Novice** - Behavior: Random valid moves | Win Rate Target: Player wins 90%+ | Reward Multiplier: 0.5×"
> "**Tier 2: Echoing Acolyte** - Behavior: Blocks immediate wins, otherwise random | Win Rate Target: Player wins 70-80% | Reward Multiplier: 0.75×"
> "**Tier 3: Grid Walker** - Behavior: Classic minimax to depth 2 | Win Rate Target: Player wins 50-60% | Reward Multiplier: 1.0×"
> "**Tier 4: Force Adept** - Behavior: Full minimax algorithm | Win Rate Target: Player draws most games | Reward Multiplier: 1.5×"
> "**Tier 5: The Eternal** - Behavior: Minimax with strategic move ordering | Win Rate Target: Player cannot win | Reward Multiplier: 2.0×"

#### Visual Spectacle System (from combat-design.md, geography-design.md)
**Symbol Placement:**
> "Orbis (O) Placement: Azure energy spirals from player position → Target cell glows with gathering light → Circle manifests from central point, expanding outward → Orbital rings spin into position → Particle corona settles into stable rotation"
> "Crucia (X) Placement: Crimson energy bolts from player position → Two slash lines converge on target cell → Cross forms from intersecting energy beams → Impact shockwave ripples across grid → Ember particles settle around symbol"

**Victory Cascade:**
> "1. Detection Pulse (0.2s): Brief white flash on aligned cells"
> "2. Connection Beam (0.3s): Energy beam links all three symbols"
> "3. Power Surge (0.5s): Beam intensifies, screen edges glow"
> "4. Victory Explosion (1.0s): Spectacular particle burst along alignment"
> "5. Aftermath (1.5s): Victorious force's energy dominates grid"

**Draw Resolution:**
> "Stalemate Storm Sequence: Tension Peak (0.3s) → Balance Recognition (0.5s) → Cosmic Equilibrium (1.0s): Both forces create balanced explosion → Universe Birth (1.5s)"

**Visual Weather States:**
> "| Calm Void | Game start | Gentle starfield, soft particle drift |"
> "| Rising Tension | 3+ symbols placed | Increased particle density, brighter stars |"
> "| Energy Storm | 6+ symbols placed | Swirling particles, lightning between cells |"

#### Resource/Reward System (from resource-design.md)
**Cosmic Essence:**
> "Victory: 100 Essence | Draw: 75 Essence | Defeat: 50 Essence | First match of day: +100 bonus"

**Faction Currencies:**
> "Orbs - O Victory: 20 Orbs | Draw as O: 10 Orbs"
> "Shards - X Victory: 20 Shards | Draw as X: 10 Shards"

**Streak Rewards:**
> "3-win streak: 1 Void Fragment"
> "5-win streak: 3 Void Fragments"
> "10-win streak: 10 Void Fragments"

#### Audio System (from lore-design.md, culture-design.md)
> "Orbis moves: Harmonic tones, smooth circular animations, cool colors"
> "Crucia moves: Sharp impact sounds, crossing slash effects, warm colors"
> "Grid ambiance: Deep space atmosphere, subtle energy hum, particle systems"

#### Starfield Background (from geography-design.md)
> "The Void Beyond: Distant nebulae and galaxies as backdrop, Drifting cosmic debris, Occasional shooting stars and celestial phenomena"

### Previous Stage Analysis (from select_feature)

The select_feature stage confirmed the following are **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**:

1. ✅ **Core Gameplay** - 3x3 grid, win/draw/loss detection, turn-based
2. ✅ **Two Factions** - Orbis (O, azure) and Crucia (X, crimson)
3. ✅ **Five AI Tiers** - Void Novice through The Eternal (minimax)
4. ✅ **Spectacular Graphics** - Starfield, particles, victory cascades, stalemate storm
5. ✅ **Audio System** - Synthesized cosmic sounds
6. ✅ **UI/HUD** - Title screen, faction/AI selection, score tracking
7. ✅ **Progression** - Cosmic Essence, faction currencies, LocalStorage persistence

### Implementation Checklist (MVP Features per systems-integration.md Phase 1)

- [x] 3x3 grid implementation
- [x] Symbol placement mechanics  
- [x] Alignment detection
- [x] Turn management
- [x] Symbol placement animations
- [x] Victory line cascade effect
- [x] Draw resolution effect
- [x] Cell transformation basics

### What Remains (Beyond MVP - Phase 2/3/4 Features)

The following are extensive endgame features documented in the design docs but **NOT required** for "a simple tic tac toe game with spectacular super graphics":

- Skill tree system (2,100 Orbs/Shards investment per faction)
- Prestige system (10 tiers, level 100 reset)
- Awakened Path (dual mastery requiring both factions)
- Void Fragments / Alignment Crystals / Primordial Sparks (rare currencies)
- Trading system

- Collection tracking with 5 cosmetic tiers
- Daily/Weekly challenges
- Profile customization (titles, frames)
- Symbol Evolution tiers (Basic → Legendary)

- Consumables (Essence Amplifier, Streak Shield, Dual Affinity)

These are **post-MVP features** and not part of the core "simple tic tac toe game."

### Summary

The game as implemented matches the user's vision: **"A simple tic tac toe game with spectacular super graphics."**

All core features specified in the design documents for a playable MVP have been implemented:
- Pure tic-tac-toe gameplay with unmodified rules
- Spectacular visual effects (particles, victory cascades, stalemate storms)
- Two-faction system (Orbis/Crucia)
- Five AI difficulty tiers
