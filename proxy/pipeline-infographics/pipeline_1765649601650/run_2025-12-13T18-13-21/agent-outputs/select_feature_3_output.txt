I now have a complete picture of what's implemented. This is **NOT** a typical RPG game with player characters, maps, collision, enemies, etc. This is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game. The feature priority list in my prompt is completely irrelevant for this type of game.

Let me assess what's actually built vs what the design docs describe:

## Next Feature: Complete - All Core Features Implemented

### Already Implemented
Based on my code review, the client has a **fully functional** Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. **Core Gameplay** (`game.js`):
   - 3x3 grid with click-to-play
   - Win/draw/loss detection
   - Turn-based gameplay
   - X goes first rule

2. **Two Factions** (`game.js`, `main.js`):
   - Orbis (O, azure/blue)
   - Crucia (X, crimson/red)
   - Faction selection UI

3. **Five AI Tiers** (`ai.js`):
   - Void Novice (random)
   - Echoing Acolyte (blocks wins)
   - Grid Walker (center/corners)
   - Force Adept (minimax)
   - The Eternal (perfect minimax)

4. **Spectacular Graphics** (`particles.js`, `game.js`):
   - Starfield background with nebula
   - Symbol placement particle bursts
   - Victory cascade effects
   - Stalemate storm dual-color explosions
   - Defeat collapse effect
   - Animated O rings and X sparks
   - Winning line glow animation

5. **Audio System** (`audio.js`):
   - Synthesized cosmic sounds
   - Placement, victory, draw, defeat sounds
   - Click/hover feedback

6. **UI/HUD** (`main.js`, `index.html`):
   - Title screen with faction/AI selection
   - Game screen with turn indicator
   - Score tracking (Player vs AI)
   - Resource display (Essence, Orbs, Shards)
   - Result overlay with rewards

7. **Progression** (`main.js`):
   - Cosmic Essence currency
   - Faction currencies (Orbs/Shards)
   - Difficulty-based reward multipliers
   - LocalStorage persistence

### Why This Feature (None Needed)

The game is **feature-complete** for a simple tic-tac-toe game with spectacular super graphics. All core features from the design documents that are appropriate for MVP implementation are already built:
- ✅ Core tic-tac-toe gameplay
- ✅ Two-faction system
- ✅ Five AI difficulty tiers
- ✅ Spectacular particle effects and animations
- ✅ Audio feedback
- ✅ Resource/reward system
- ✅ Win/loss/draw tracking

The extensive progression systems in the design docs (skill trees, trading, prestige, consumables, epic items) are **endgame features** beyond the scope of "a simple tic tac toe game."

**The provided feature priority list (player character, maps, collision, enemies, combat, classes, inventory) is for an RPG - this is a Tic-Tac-Toe game and those features are NOT applicable.**
