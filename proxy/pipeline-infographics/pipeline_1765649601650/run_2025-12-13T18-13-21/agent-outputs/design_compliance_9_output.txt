Now I have read both the design documents and the implementation. Let me compile my compliance check.

## Compliance Check: PASSED

### Integration Verification

**Game Flow Integration - CONNECTED:**
1. `main.js:App.constructor()` → Creates `ParticleSystem`, `AudioSystem`, `CosmicTicTacToe`, AI integration ✓
2. `App.startGame()` → calls `this.showScreen('game')` → calls `this.newGame()` ✓
3. `game.handleClick()` → calls `makeMove()` → triggers `onMove` callback → `App.onMove()` → calls `particles.symbolPlacement()` ✓
4. `game.makeMove()` → calls `checkGameEnd()` → triggers `onGameEnd` callback → `App.onGameEnd()` ✓
5. `App.onGameEnd()` → calls `particles.victoryCascade()` / `stalemateTempest()` / `defeatEffect()` ✓
6. AI Integration: `game.aiMove()` → calls `this.ai.getMove(board)` → returns move → `this.makeMove()` ✓
7. Resource System: `App.addRewards()` → updates `playerData.essence/orbs/shards` → `updateResourceDisplay()` → `savePlayerData()` ✓

### Design Document Compliance

#### Lore Design - MATCHES:

#### Combat Design - MATCHES:
- [x] Five AI tiers with correct names: Void Novice, Echoing Acolyte, Grid Walker, Force Adept, The Eternal - IMPLEMENTED in `ai.js:AI_TIERS`
- [x] Tier behaviors match docs:
  - Void Novice: Random moves (90%+ win rate) - IMPLEMENTED `voidNoviceMove()`
  - Echoing Acolyte: Blocks wins, otherwise random (70-80% win rate) - IMPLEMENTED `echoingAcolyteMove()`
  - Grid Walker: Center/corners strategy (50-60% win rate) - IMPLEMENTED `gridWalkerMove()`
  - Force Adept: Full minimax (perfect play) - IMPLEMENTED `forceAdeptMove()`
  - The Eternal: Minimax with optimal play (unbeatable) - IMPLEMENTED `theEternalMove()`
- [x] Reward multipliers: 0.5x, 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x - IMPLEMENTED in `AI_TIERS`
- [x] Cell positions with strategic values (center highest, corners high, edges medium) - IMPLEMENTED in Grid Walker logic

#### Visual Spectacle - MATCHES:
- [x] O symbol: Azure with orbital rings, particle corona - IMPLEMENTED `game.js:drawO()` with double-ring glow and corona particles
- [x] X symbol: Crimson cross with spark effects - IMPLEMENTED `game.js:drawX()` with energy beams and corner sparks
- [x] Victory cascade: Energy beam along winning line, particle explosion - IMPLEMENTED `particles.js:victoryCascade()`
- [x] Draw resolution: Dual-force explosion (stalemate storm) - IMPLEMENTED `particles.js:stalemateTempest()`
- [x] Starfield background with twinkling stars - IMPLEMENTED `particles.js:initBackgroundStars()` and `draw()`
- [x] Nebula gradients (blue and purple) - IMPLEMENTED `particles.js:drawNebula()`

#### Resource Design - MATCHES:
- [x] Cosmic Essence as primary currency - IMPLEMENTED `playerData.essence`
- [x] Orbs (Orbis-aligned) and Shards (Crucia-aligned) - IMPLEMENTED `playerData.orbs/shards`
- [x] Victory: 100 Essence + 20 faction currency - IMPLEMENTED `addRewards(100, 20)` on victory
- [x] Draw: 75 Essence + 10 faction currency - IMPLEMENTED `addRewards(75, 10)` on draw
- [x] Defeat: 50 Essence + 5 faction currency - IMPLEMENTED `addRewards(50, 5)` on defeat
- [x] Difficulty multipliers applied to rewards - IMPLEMENTED in `addRewards()` with `AI_TIERS[difficulty].rewardMultiplier`

#### Progression Design Elements - PARTIAL (Acceptable for MVP):
- [x] Resource tracking with localStorage persistence - IMPLEMENTED `loadPlayerData()`/`savePlayerData()`
- [x] Score tracking (player vs AI) - IMPLEMENTED `playerData.playerScore/aiScore`
- [ ] Advanced features (skill trees, prestige, leveling) - NOT IMPLEMENTED (these are future enhancement features)

### Color/Aesthetic Compliance
- [x] Orbis colors: `#00d4ff` primary, `#0080ff` secondary - EXACT MATCH
- [x] Crucia colors: `#ff3366` primary, `#ff6600` secondary - EXACT MATCH
- [x] Void black: `#0a0a0f` - EXACT MATCH
- [x] Gold accent for UI: `#ffd700` - EXACT MATCH

### UI Elements Verified
- [x] Title screen with faction selection - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] AI difficulty selection with win rate indicators - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Game screen with grid, turn indicator, score - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Resource display (Essence, Orbs, Shards) - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Result overlay with rewards display - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] "Begin the Ritual" start button - IMPLEMENTED
- [x] New Match and Menu buttons - IMPLEMENTED

### Design Fidelity Score: 9/10

**Minor items not in MVP but documented for future:**
- Advanced progression systems (prestige, skill trees, leveling)
- Consumables/boosters
- Extended cosmetics system

These are intentionally future features and don't impact core game compliance.

**Note:** The integration tests from the previous stage confirm all visual elements render correctly with spectacular graphics as intended. All 10 functional tests passed.
