ASSESSMENT:

**Understanding of Request**: The plan demonstrates a clear understanding of the task - building a wallet_manager agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md with specific capabilities for wallet creation, address generation, funding, balance queries, transaction monitoring, and backup operations.

**Approach Quality**: The approach is methodical and well-structured:
- Leverages existing reference implementations (wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ, bitcoin_daemon_manager.json from claudeplus)
- Follows established patterns for agent JSON structure
- Covers all user-specified requirements comprehensively
- Includes proper error handling considerations

**Step-by-Step Logic**: The 9-step plan is logical and sequential:
1. Research existing implementations ✓
2. Understand agent format ✓
3. Extract requirements ✓
4. Create comprehensive systemPrompt ✓
5. Define configuration ✓
6. Define decision keywords ✓
7. Structure complete JSON ✓
8. Write to specified path ✓
9. Validate output ✓

**Test Considerations**: Excellent coverage of test scenarios:
- Wallet lifecycle operations (create, load, fund)
- Address generation variations
- Balance query states
- Transaction monitoring
- Backup operations
- Comprehensive error scenarios (daemon down, duplicate wallets, RPC failures, etc.)

**Evidence Quality Analysis**:

**STRENGTHS**:
1. Concrete file outputs specified: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`
2. Multiple reference reads (existing wallet_manager.json, bitcoin_daemon_manager.json)
3. File verification and JSON validation steps
4. Specific checks for required fields and decision keywords
5. SystemPrompt coverage verification for section 2.2 requirements

**WEAKNESSES**:
1. Missing actual read from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2 - the plan references it but doesn't explicitly show reading it
2. No verification that the output JSON matches the exact format expected by the claudeplus system
3. No example of comparing the generated JSON against the specification requirements systematically

**CONCERNS**:
- The plan assumes the existing wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ is the correct reference, but doesn't verify it aligns with section 2.2 specs
- No explicit step to verify all user-specified decisions (wallet_created, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, error) are included

**Confidence Justification**: The "High" confidence is well-justified because:
- Clear specifications exist
- Reference implementations available
- Required permissions granted
- Well-defined bitcoin-cli commands
- Specific output path provided

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The proposed evidence includes:
- Concrete file reads from reference implementations
- The complete JSON file written to specified path
- File verification and JSON validation
- Structural checks for required fields
- Coverage verification for capabilities and decisions

However, it could be strengthened by explicitly including the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2 read as evidence item #1.

**Minor Refinement Needed**: The plan should explicitly include reading section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md as the first evidence item to verify alignment with the source specification.
