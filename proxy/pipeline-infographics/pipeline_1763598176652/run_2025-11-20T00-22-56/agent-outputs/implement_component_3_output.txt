## Summary

I have successfully created the **wallet_manager** agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The complete agent JSON has been written to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`.

### Key Accomplishments:

**✅ All Section 2.2 Requirements Implemented:**
- Create new wallet using bitcoin-cli createwallet
- Generate receive addresses (bech32 format)
- Fund wallet via regtest mining (generatetoaddress with 101 blocks)
- Query balance (getbalance, getwalletinfo, listunspent)
- Monitor incoming transactions (listtransactions)
- Export wallet for backup (backupwallet with rotation)

**✅ All User-Specified Decisions Included:**
- `wallet_created` - New wallet created successfully
- `wallet_funded` - Wallet funded with coinbase rewards
- `balance_confirmed` - Balance query completed
- `error` - Error in wallet operation
- Plus additional decisions: `wallet_loaded`, `address_generated`

**✅ All Required Permissions:**
- Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

**✅ Comprehensive System Prompt (19KB):**
- Complete wallet lifecycle management
- Detailed bitcoin-cli command examples
- 7 common error scenarios with recovery procedures
- Best practices for pool operations
- RPC configuration and authentication
- Security considerations

**✅ Rich Configuration:**
- RPC endpoint settings
- Wallet creation parameters
- Address pool management (100 mining + 50 payout addresses)
- Automated backup (daily, 7-day retention)
- Funding configuration (101 blocks for mature coinbase)
- Transaction monitoring settings

The agent follows the established pattern from `bitcoin_daemon_manager.json` while incorporating all wallet-specific requirements and best practices from the reference implementation.
