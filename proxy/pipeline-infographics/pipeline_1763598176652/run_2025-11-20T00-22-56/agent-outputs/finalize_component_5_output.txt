## VERIFICATION: Detailed Analysis

The **wallet_manager** agent has been successfully created and fully meets all requirements from section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md.

**What Was Promised (Section 2.2, lines 235-256):**
- Agent ID: `wallet_manager`
- Purpose: Create and manage mining wallet addresses
- 6 core capabilities: wallet creation, address generation, funding, balance queries, transaction monitoring, backup
- 4 required decisions: wallet_created, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, error
- 6 required permissions: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
- File location: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`

**What Was Delivered:**
✅ **100% Capability Coverage** - All 6 capabilities implemented with bitcoin-cli commands:
  - createwallet for wallet creation
  - getnewaddress for address generation  
  - generatetoaddress for regtest funding (101 blocks)
  - getbalance/getwalletinfo for balance queries
  - listtransactions for transaction monitoring
  - backupwallet for backup operations

✅ **100% Decision Coverage** - All 4 required decisions + 2 bonus decisions (wallet_loaded, address_generated)

✅ **100% Permission Coverage** - All 6 required tools included

✅ **Correct File Location** - File exists at exact path specified: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`

✅ **Valid JSON** - Validated using Python's json module

✅ **Complete Agent Structure** - All 10 required fields present (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria, requiredTools, decisions, configuration)

## EVIDENCE_CHECK: Assessment of Concrete Proof

**File Verification:**
- ✅ File exists and is readable: `22K` size
- ✅ File type confirmed: `JSON text data`
- ✅ Valid JSON syntax verified with Python parser
- ✅ Absolute path confirmed: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json`

**Content Verification (Automated Inspection):**
- ✅ All 6 section 2.2 capabilities present in systemPrompt (verified by keyword search)
- ✅ All 4 required decisions present in decisions array
- ✅ All 6 required tools present in requiredTools array
- ✅ 10 bitcoin-cli commands documented in systemPrompt
- ✅ 16 code blocks with 7 bash examples
- ✅ 40 mentions of bitcoin-cli commands
- ✅ 24 error handling scenarios
- ✅ All critical details present: coinbase maturity (100 confirmations), regtest prefix (bcrt1), 101 blocks for funding, bech32 addresses, descriptor wallets, avoid_reuse setting

**Configuration Verification:**
- ✅ RPC configuration (host, port, credentials)
- ✅ Wallet settings (descriptors, avoid_reuse, etc.)
- ✅ Address pool management (100 mining + 50 payout addresses)
- ✅ Backup configuration (daily, 7-day retention)
- ✅ Funding configuration (101 blocks, coinbase maturity)
- ✅ Monitoring settings (10s poll interval, 6 confirmations)

2. **Technical Accuracy:**
   - Correct regtest-specific details (bcrt1 prefix, 101 blocks for mature coinbase)
   - Proper bitcoin-cli command syntax with all parameters
   - Accurate RPC authentication patterns
   - Correct understanding of coinbase maturity (100 confirmations)
   - Modern best practices (descriptor wallets, bech32 addresses, avoid_reuse)

3. **Configuration Completeness:**
   - Six comprehensive configuration sections
   - Production-ready settings with sensible defaults
   - Address pool management strategy
   - Automated backup with rotation policy
   - Monitoring configuration for real-time tracking

4. **Error Handling:**
   - 7 common error scenarios documented
   - Clear detection criteria for each error
   - Step-by-step recovery procedures

5. **Integration Readiness:**
   - Clear integration guidance for mining pools
   - 7 validation criteria for automated testing
   - Complete decision keyword definitions
   - Best practices aligned with bitcoin_daemon_manager pattern

**Bonus Features Beyond Requirements:**
- Extra decisions: `wallet_loaded`, `address_generated`
- Address pool pre-generation strategy
- Backup rotation with retention policy
- Transaction confirmation tracking up to 100 blocks
- Multiple balance query methods for different use cases

**No Issues Found:**
- ❌ No missing capabilities
