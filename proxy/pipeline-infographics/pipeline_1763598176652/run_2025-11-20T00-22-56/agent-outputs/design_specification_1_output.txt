UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the wallet_manager agent according to section 2.2 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document. The agent should handle wallet operations including creation, address generation, balance queries, transaction monitoring, and backups. I need to write the complete agent JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json. I've found that a wallet_manager.json already exists in the private-SuperCoinServ project, which I can use as a reference for structure and requirements.

APPROACH: I will create a comprehensive plan to develop the wallet_manager agent based on:
1. Section 2.2 specifications from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (lines 235-255)
2. The existing wallet_manager.json structure from private-SuperCoinServ (which provides detailed implementation guidance)
3. The pattern established by bitcoin_daemon_manager.json in claudeplus
4. User requirements for wallet operations using bitcoin-cli

The agent will handle wallet lifecycle, address management, balance tracking, transaction monitoring, and backup operations.

STEPS:
1. Read the existing wallet_manager.json from private-SuperCoinServ to understand the comprehensive structure and all required fields
2. Analyze the bitcoin_daemon_manager.json structure from claudeplus to understand the agent format (systemPrompt style, configuration, decisions)
3. Extract section 2.2 requirements from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md (wallet_manager capabilities)
4. Create a comprehensive systemPrompt that covers:
   - Wallet creation using bitcoin-cli createwallet
   - Address generation (getnewaddress)
   - Wallet funding via generatetoaddress (regtest)
   - Balance queries (getbalance, getwalletinfo, listunspent)
   - Transaction monitoring (listtransactions, gettransaction)
   - Wallet backup (backupwallet)
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Integration with bitcoin daemon
5. Define the agent configuration including RPC settings, wallet settings, address pool management, backup configuration
6. Define all decision keywords: wallet_created, wallet_loaded, wallet_funded, balance_confirmed, address_generated, error
7. Structure the complete JSON with all required fields: id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, outputFormat, validationCriteria, requiredTools, decisions, configuration
8. Write the complete agent JSON file to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json
9. Validate JSON syntax and completeness

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Test wallet creation from scratch (no existing wallet)
- Test wallet loading when wallet already exists
- Test address generation (multiple addresses, different types)
- Test wallet funding with 101 blocks (mature coinbase)
- Test balance queries with various states (empty, funded, confirmed, unconfirmed)
- Test transaction monitoring (incoming, outgoing, confirmations)
- Test backup operations (successful backup, failed backup with recovery)
- Test error scenarios:
  - Daemon not running
  - Wallet already exists (handle gracefully)
  - RPC connection failures
  - Insufficient funds
  - Invalid addresses
  - Backup directory doesn't exist

EVIDENCE: I will collect the following proof:
1. Read output showing the existing wallet_manager.json structure from private-SuperCoinServ
2. Read output showing bitcoin_daemon_manager.json pattern from claudeplus
3. The complete wallet_manager.json file content written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/wallet_manager.json
4. File verification showing the JSON was created successfully
5. JSON structure validation (proper format, all required fields present)
6. Decision keywords properly defined matching user requirements
7. SystemPrompt covering all capabilities listed in section 2.2
8. Configuration matching regtest environment requirements

CONFIDENCE: High - I have:
- Clear specification from section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Existing comprehensive wallet_manager.json as reference
- Established agent pattern from bitcoin_daemon_manager.json
- Specific user requirements for capabilities and decisions
- Well-defined bitcoin-cli commands for wallet operations
- Clear output path specified by user
- All necessary permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)

DECISION: design_complete
