UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a complete pipeline JSON file for a share-submission-test pipeline based on section 3.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline has 7 stages with specific stage names and service mappings that need to flow from ensuring the stack is running through to verifying share submissions.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.2 requirements and context
2. Examine existing pipeline JSON templates to understand the correct structure and format
3. Map each of the 7 stages to their corresponding services with proper configuration
4. Build the complete JSON structure following the established pipeline format
5. Write the final JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Read /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 3.2 requirements
2) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/*.json
3) Read 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the schema (structure, required fields, stage definitions, transitions)
4) Create the pipeline JSON with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - 7 stages as specified with proper service mappings:
     * ensure_full_stack_running → network_monitor
     * set_low_difficulty → config_generator
     * monitor_share_submissions → stratum_monitor
     * validate_pool_responses → share_validator
     * analyze_acceptance_rate → performance_analyzer
     * test_reject_handling → share_validator
     * share_submission_verified → END
   - Proper transitions between stages
   - Any required parameters or configuration per stage based on section 3.2
5) Write the complete JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/share-submission-test.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Will ensure all 7 stages are correctly defined with proper service mappings
- Will validate that stage transitions follow the specified flow (1→2→3→4→5→6→7→END)
- Will check that the structure matches existing pipeline templates
- Will ensure all required fields from section 3.2 are included
- Will verify the file is written to the correct absolute path

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the content of section 3.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will display example pipeline JSON structure from existing templates
- Will provide the complete generated JSON content before writing
- Will confirm successful file write to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/share-submission-test.json
- Will verify the file exists and contains valid JSON after writing

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This requires understanding the specific pipeline format used in this codebase and mapping requirements from section 3.2, but once I examine the existing templates and documentation, the JSON structure should be straightforward to construct following established patterns.
