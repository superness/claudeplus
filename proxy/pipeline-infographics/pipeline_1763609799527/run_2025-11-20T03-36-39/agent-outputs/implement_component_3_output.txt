Excellent! The share-submission-test pipeline has been successfully created. Let me provide a summary of what was built:

## ✅ Pipeline Created: share-submission-test.json

**Location**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/share-submission-test.json`

**Pipeline Structure** (7 stages as specified):

1. **ensure_full_stack_running** → `network_monitor`
   - Verifies daemon + pool + miner are active and connected

2. **set_low_difficulty** → `config_generator`
   - Configures easy difficulty for rapid share generation

3. **monitor_share_submissions** → `stratum_monitor`
   - Captures and tracks share submission attempts

4. **validate_pool_responses** → `share_validator`
   - Checks accept/reject responses from pool

5. **analyze_acceptance_rate** → `performance_analyzer`
   - Calculates percentage of shares accepted vs rejected

6. **test_reject_handling** → `share_validator`
   - Verifies invalid shares are properly rejected

7. **share_submission_verified** → `share_validator` (END stage)
   - Final validation of complete share submission system

**Key Features**:
- Sequential flow with conditional branching
- Error handling at each stage (PIPELINE ENDS on failures)
- Based on Section 3.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Includes metadata with tags, components, prerequisites
- Valid JSON syntax (verified)
- 237 lines, 9.0KB file size

The pipeline follows the established pattern from existing templates like `daemon-pool-integration.json` and `mining-health-check-v1.json`, ensuring consistency with the pipeline framework.
