ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding of the core task: Create a pipeline JSON file with 7 specific stages mapped to their services
2. Logical approach that starts with reading documentation and existing templates before building
3. Includes reading MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.2 for requirements
4. Plans to examine existing pipeline JSON templates to understand the correct schema
5. Specifies the exact file path for output: /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/share-submission-test.json
6. Lists all 7 stages with their service mappings correctly
7. Considers validation and verification steps

**Weaknesses:**
1. Evidence collection is somewhat generic - doesn't specify WHAT specific content from section 3.2 will be captured
2. "Will verify the JSON is valid" - doesn't specify HOW this verification will be done (e.g., using a JSON validator, manual inspection, or parsing test)
3. "Will ensure all required fields from section 3.2 are included" - but doesn't specify what those required fields ARE
4. Confidence level is "Medium-High" but this seems appropriate given unknowns about the existing schema
5. No mention of handling potential errors (e.g., what if section 3.2 doesn't exist, or templates directory is missing)

**Critical Analysis:**
The plan demonstrates solid understanding of the task structure but lacks specificity in some verification steps. However, the approach is sound: read documentation → examine examples → build following patterns → write output. The evidence steps are adequate to prove task completion.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**

The plan specifies concrete evidence that will prove completion:
- Content from section 3.2 will be shown
- Example pipeline JSON structure will be displayed
- Complete generated JSON will be provided before writing
- File write confirmation will be given
- Post-write verification that file exists and contains valid JSON

This provides a clear audit trail from requirements → examples → implementation → verification.

**Verification Path:**
1. Source documentation (section 3.2) will be visible
2. Template examples will be visible
3. Generated JSON will be visible
4. File write success will be confirmed
5. File existence and validity will be verified

This is sufficient to prove the task was completed correctly.
