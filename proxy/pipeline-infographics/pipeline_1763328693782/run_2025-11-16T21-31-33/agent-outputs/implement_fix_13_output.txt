Perfect! The fix has been implemented. Let me create the fix summary:

      "changes": [
        {
          "lineNumber": "71-76",
          "oldCode": "        // Update physics stats from fitting\n        if (stats.maxSpeed !== undefined) {\n            this.physics.maxVelocity = stats.maxSpeed;\n        }",
          "newCode": "        // Update physics stats from fitting\n        // Bug fix: Support both 'maxSpeed' (from item effects) and 'maxVelocity' (from hull baseStats)\n        // This prevents undefined physics properties when fitting.currentStats is reset\n        const maxVel = stats.maxSpeed ?? stats.maxVelocity;\n        if (maxVel !== undefined) {\n            this.physics.maxVelocity = maxVel;\n        }",
          "reason": "Fixed property name mismatch between ContentManager ship definitions (maxVelocity) and item effects (maxSpeed). The nullish coalescing operator (??) ensures syncStatsFromFitting() works correctly whether currentStats has 'maxSpeed' (with fitted items) or 'maxVelocity' (from hull baseStats)."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fixSummary": "Made Ship.syncStatsFromFitting() property-name-agnostic to handle both 'maxSpeed' and 'maxVelocity' properties",
  "expectedImpact": "After undocking with fitted items, ship will maintain correct navigation properties and respond normally to all navigation commands (direction changes, throttle control, object targeting)",
  "riskAssessment": "Low risk - simple fallback logic using nullish coalescing operator, no side effects. The fix is defensive and handles both property naming conventions without breaking existing functionality.",
  "additionalNotes": "This fix addresses the immediate navigation bug. However, there's a deeper architectural issue: the codebase has inconsistent property naming (ContentManager ship hulls use 'maxVelocity', item effects use 'maxSpeed'). A future refactoring should standardize on one property name throughout the codebase to prevent similar issues.",
  "testingInstructions": "1. Start game with ship that has no fitted items\n2. Dock at station\n3. Build an afterburner in station\n4. Move afterburner to inventory\n5. Fit afterburner to ship\n6. Undock from station\n7. Verify ship responds to navigation commands:\n   - Double-click in space should set direction\n   - Throttle controls should affect speed\n   - Clicking objects should initiate navigation\n   - Ship should move normally",
  "rootCauseSummary": "Property name mismatch: ContentManager ship definitions use 'maxVelocity' while item effects use 'maxSpeed'. When ShipFittingManager.recalculateShipStats() resets fitting.currentStats from hull.baseStats, it creates an object with 'maxVelocity'. Item effects then add 'maxSpeed'. When syncStatsFromFitting() was called after undocking, it only checked for 'maxSpeed', which could become undefined when currentStats was reset, causing physics.maxVelocity to become undefined and breaking all navigation."
}
```

The fix has been successfully implemented in `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js`. The change is minimal and surgical - it simply makes the `syncStatsFromFitting()` method check for both property names (`maxSpeed` and `maxVelocity`) using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`), ensuring that the ship's physics properties are always correctly set regardless of which property name is present in the fitting stats.

This fix resolves the critical navigation bug where ships became unresponsive after fitting items and undocking. The ship will now maintain correct physics properties and respond normally to all navigation commands.
