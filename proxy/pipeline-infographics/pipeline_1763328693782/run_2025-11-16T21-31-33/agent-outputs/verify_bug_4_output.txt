# Bug Verification Analysis

## Evidence Review

I need to analyze the reproduction evidence from the previous stage. Let me check what runtime evidence was actually provided.

## Critical Assessment: RUNTIME EVIDENCE PRESENT?

Looking at the `[run_reproduction]` output:

❌ **No WebSocket response logs provided**
❌ **No evidence.json file contents provided**  
❌ **No browser console output from actual execution**
❌ **No game state snapshots captured**
❌ **No test execution results**

### What Was Actually Provided:

✅ Test script files were **created** (`manual_reproduction_console_script.js`)
✅ Server was **started** (port 8080)
✅ **Instructions** for manual execution were provided
❌ Tests were **NOT executed** - only prepared

### Key Quote from Reproduction Stage:
> "Since we're in WSL without GUI access, the script requires **manual browser execution**"
> 
> **DECISION: execution_complete**

The reproduction stage ended at "execution_complete" but actually means "**script preparation complete**" - not "**bug reproduction complete**".

## Evidence Analysis

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "No runtime evidence available. The reproduction stage created automated test scripts and started a development server, but did not execute the tests or capture any actual game behavior. The scripts exist and are ready to run, but without browser execution logs, WebSocket responses, game state snapshots, or console output, I cannot confirm whether the bug actually reproduces. The reproduction stage explicitly states 'requires manual browser execution' and ended without executing the tests.",
  
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,

    "receivedInstead": "Test script creation, server startup confirmation, and manual execution instructions. The reproduction_creator prepared the testing infrastructure but did not execute tests due to WSL environment limitations (no GUI access).",

  ],
  
  "nextSteps": "Execute the prepared test script in an actual browser environment to capture runtime evidence. Specific actions needed: (1) Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser with GUI access, (2) Open DevTools console (F12), (3) Copy/paste the contents of tests/manual_reproduction_console_script.js, (4) Capture the console output showing step execution and results, (5) Export window.bugReproductionEvidence JSON object, (6) Provide browser console logs, game state snapshots, and any error messages. Only then can bug existence be verified with actual runtime evidence."
}
```

## Summary

The reproduction stage did excellent work **preparing** the test infrastructure, but stopped short of **executing** the tests due to environment constraints (WSL without GUI). This is a common scenario in headless/CI environments.

**What we have:** 
- ✅ Well-designed automated test script
- ✅ Development server running
- ✅ Clear execution instructions

**What we need:**
- ❌ Actual test execution in browser
- ❌ Console logs showing test results  
- ❌ Game state snapshots (initial, docked, fitted, undocked)
- ❌ Evidence of maxVelocity changes
- ❌ Proof that ship does/doesn't accelerate

**Analogy:** We have a thermometer (test script) and instructions on how to take someone's temperature, but we haven't actually measured anything yet. We can't diagnose a fever without the actual temperature reading.
