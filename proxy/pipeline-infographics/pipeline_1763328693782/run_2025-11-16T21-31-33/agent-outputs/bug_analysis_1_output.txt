  "bugSummary": "Navigation system becomes completely unresponsive after fitting items and undocking from station",
  "expectedBehavior": "After fitting items to a ship and undocking, the ship should respond normally to all navigation commands: double-clicking should set navigation targets with notifications, clicking objects should initiate navigation, and throttle controls should affect ship speed",
  "actualBehavior": "After the fitting→undocking sequence, the ship becomes completely unresponsive to navigation commands. Throttle appears to change but doesn't affect speed, clicking/double-clicking produces no navigation response or notifications, and the ship cannot change direction or speed",
  "affectedSystems": ["navigation", "ship_fitting", "station_docking", "input_handling", "ship_physics"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Launch the game in browser and ensure ship starts with no fitted items",
    "Step 2: Navigate to and dock at a station",
    "Step 3: In station interface, craft an item (e.g., afterburner) using the crafting system",
    "Step 4: Move the newly crafted item from crafting output to ship inventory",
    "Step 5: Open ship fitting interface and fit the item to the ship",
    "Step 6: Undock from the station",
    "Step 7: Attempt to navigate by double-clicking in space (observe no notification)",
    "Step 8: Try clicking on objects to navigate (observe no response)",
    "Step 9: Adjust throttle controls (observe throttle UI changes but ship speed doesn't change)",
    "Step 10: Confirm ship is completely unresponsive to all navigation inputs"

  "hypothesis": "The undocking process or ship fitting process is likely corrupting the ship's physics state, navigation state, or input event handlers. Possible causes: (1) ShipFittingManager may be incorrectly reinitializing the ship object when applying fitted items, breaking references to the physics engine or input handlers; (2) StationManager's undock process may be creating a new ship instance instead of restoring the existing one, losing input bindings; (3) Navigation state may not be properly reset/reinitialized after undocking; (4) Event listeners for navigation inputs may be getting detached during the fitting or undocking process. The fact that throttle UI updates but doesn't affect speed suggests the ship physics object is disconnected from the control inputs."
