Perfect! Now I have enough information. Let me trace through the complete execution flow to identify the root cause. Based on the evidence from the automated test and the code analysis, I can now provide a comprehensive root cause analysis.

```json
{
  "rootCause": "StationManager.undock() line 560 calls playerShip.syncStatsFromFitting() which restores SOME physics properties from fitted items, but the Ship constructor never initializes a default ship fitting in ShipFittingManager, so syncStatsFromFitting() reads from an EMPTY fitting configuration, setting maxVelocity and other properties to undefined. The fitting system and ship physics initialization are disconnected - ships are created with default physics from SHIP_CONFIGURATIONS but ShipFittingManager has no knowledge of these ships until explicitly told.",

  "whyItHappens": "There are THREE disconnected systems managing ship stats: (1) SHIP_CONFIGURATIONS in ShipPhysics.js with property names like 'maxVelocity', (2) ContentManager ship definitions with property names like 'maxSpeed', and (3) Ship.physics which uses SHIP_CONFIGURATIONS naming. When ShipFittingManager initializes from ContentManager data, it uses 'maxSpeed'. When syncStatsFromFitting() tries to restore physics, it reads 'maxSpeed' and writes to 'maxVelocity', but the value is undefined because ContentManager doesn't set maxSpeed properly. The undock process calls syncStatsFromFitting() which overwrites working physics values with undefined, breaking navigation.",
  "proposedFix": "Option 1 (Quick Fix): Remove the syncStatsFromFitting() call from StationManager.undock() line 560. The ship physics is already correct from initialization; the sync only breaks it. Option 2 (Proper Fix): Make ShipFittingManager initialize currentStats from the actual Ship.physics object instead of ContentManager, so the property names and values match. Option 3 (Architecture Fix): Unify SHIP_CONFIGURATIONS and ContentManager ship definitions to use consistent property names, and ensure ShipFittingManager properly copies ALL physics properties when initializing."
