Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of the reproduction script:

## Summary

I've successfully created an automated bug reproduction script using the WebSocket-based game control system. Here's what was delivered:

### 📁 Files Created

1. **`/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/reproduce_navigation_bug.js`**
   - Complete Node.js automation script (404 lines)
   - Connects to game via WebSocket on port 8765
   - Executes 8-command sequence to reproduce the bug
   - Collects detailed evidence and generates reports

2. **`/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/README_NAVIGATION_BUG.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation for running the test
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Evidence file descriptions
   - Integration instructions

3. **`/mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests/package.json`** (updated)
   - Added `test:navigation` script for easy execution

### 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships/tests
npm install  # Install WebSocket dependency
npm run test:navigation
```

### 📊 Command Sequence

The script automates this 8-step reproduction:

1. **getShipState** → Verify initial state (no fitted items)
2. **dock** → Dock at station
3. **addResource** → Add afterburner to inventory
4. **fitItem** → Fit afterburner to ship
5. **undock** → Undock from station (bug trigger point)
6. **getShipState** → Check post-undock state
7. **setPosition** → **Test navigation** (attempts to move ship to x:1000)
8. **getShipState** → Verify final state

### 🎯 Expected Result

**If bug is present**: Command #7 (setPosition) will fail or ship won't move, proving navigation is broken after fitting+undocking. Script exits with code 0 (success).

**If bug is fixed**: Navigation responds normally. Script exits with code 1 (unexpected - bug not reproduced).

### 📄 Evidence Output

- **`navigation_bug_evidence.json`** - Full test details, all responses, verification results
- **`navigation_bug_summary.json`** - Quick summary with pass/fail status

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Fully Automated**: No manual clicking required
- **Self-Documenting**: Each command has description and verification
- **Evidence Collection**: Saves complete JSON evidence for analysis
- **CI/CD Ready**: Proper exit codes and machine-readable output
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles WebSocket failures, browser launch issues
- **Clear Output**: Color-coded console output with step-by-step progress

The script is ready to execute and will definitively prove whether the navigation bug can be reproduced via the WebSocket automation API.

**DECISION: script_ready**
