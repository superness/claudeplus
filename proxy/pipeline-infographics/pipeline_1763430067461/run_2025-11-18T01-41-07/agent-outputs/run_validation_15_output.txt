## Critical Findings

**BUG REPRODUCED: Ship fitted items are NOT persisting across browser sessions**

### Test Execution Results

1. **Phase 1 - Setup (SUCCESSFUL)**:
   - ✅ Docked at station
   - ✅ Added Mining Laser to inventory
   - ✅ Added Afterburner to inventory  
   - ✅ Fitted Mining Laser to high slot [0]
   - ✅ Fitted Afterburner to mid slot [0]
   - ✅ Verified items fitted correctly

2. **Phase 2 - Browser Restart (SUCCESSFUL)**:
   - ✅ Chrome killed gracefully
   - ✅ Chrome relaunched with same user-data-dir (preserves localStorage)
   - ✅ Game reconnected successfully
   - ✅ localStorage persistence mechanism active

3. **Phase 3 - Verification (BUG DETECTED)**:
   - ❌ **ALL fitted items LOST**
   - ❌ High slots: empty (was: Mining Laser)
   - ❌ Mid slots: empty (was: Afterburner)
   - ❌ Low slots: empty (no change)

### Evidence Summary

**Before Restart:**
- High[0]: `basic_mining_laser` (Basic Mining Laser)
- Mid[0]: `basic_afterburner` (Basic Afterburner)

**After Restart:**
- High[0]: `null`
- Mid[0]: `null`

### Console Logs

The console log file was captured at:
`C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`

5 console errors logged (unrelated to the bug - GCM authentication errors from Chrome internals)

### Test Validation

✅ **Environment properly configured** (HTTP server with `-c-1`, Chrome with debug logging)  
✅ **Test script executed successfully** (13 commands executed)  
✅ **Evidence collected** (complete evidence file with before/after state)  
✅ **Console logs captured** (5 entries, ChromeManager working correctly)  
✅ **Bug reproduced reliably** (fitted items lost on browser restart)

**DECISION: BUG_REPRODUCED**
