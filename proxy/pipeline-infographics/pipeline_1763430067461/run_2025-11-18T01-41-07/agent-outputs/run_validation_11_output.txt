## Test Results Summary

**✅ Test Environment Setup:** Successful
- HTTP server running on port 8080 with caching disabled (`-c-1`)
- Old Chrome processes killed
- WebSocket server started on port 8765

**✅ Reproduction Script Execution:** Successful
- Script: `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`
- Duration: ~35 seconds
- Commands executed: 13

**🐛 BUG REPRODUCED:** Confirmed

### Key Evidence:

**Before Browser Restart:**
- ✅ Mining Laser fitted to high slot 0
- ✅ Afterburner fitted to mid slot 0

**After Browser Restart (with localStorage preserved):**
- ❌ High slot 0: **EMPTY** (should be Mining Laser)
- ❌ Mid slot 0: **EMPTY** (should be Afterburner)

### Test Flow:
1. ✅ Docked at station
2. ✅ Added test items to inventory
3. ✅ Fitted items to ship slots (verified working)
4. ✅ Chrome browser fully restarted with same user-data-dir (localStorage persisted)
5. ✅ Game reloaded
6. 🐛 **Fitted items LOST** - all slots returned to null

### Console Logs:
- 5 console errors captured (Chrome GCM registration issues - unrelated to bug)
- No game-specific errors detected
- Console logging system working correctly

### Conclusion:
The bug is **100% REPRODUCED**. Ship fitted items are not persisting across browser restarts despite localStorage being preserved. The fix implemented in `ShipFittingManager.js` and `SpaceshipSimulator.js` needs to be tested to verify it resolves this issue.

**DECISION: BUG_REPRODUCED**
