Perfect! The fix is in place. Let me create a summary of the implementation:

## Fix Implementation Summary

**Files Modified:**
1. `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/SaveGameManager.js` (lines 690-706)

**Root Cause:**
The serialization logic in `serializeShipFitting()` only iterated over items already in the `playerInventory` Map. Fitted items that were never in the inventory (e.g., purchased and immediately fitted from a station) were not included in the serialized inventory. During restoration, the `deserializeShipFitting()` method tries to refit items by calling `fitItem()`, which requires items to exist in inventory or cargo. Without these items in the serialized inventory, the `fitItem()` calls failed silently, leaving slots empty.

**The Fix:**
Modified the serialization logic to ensure ALL fitted items are included in the serialized inventory, regardless of whether they were ever in `playerInventory`:

1. **First pass** (lines 695-697): Iterate through `fittedItemCounts` Map and add all fitted items to `serializedInventory`. This ensures items that were only fitted (never in inventory) are preserved.

2. **Second pass** (lines 700-706): Iterate through `playerInventory` and combine with fitted counts. This handles items that exist both in inventory AND as fitted items.

**Code Changes:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (buggy):
const serializedInventory = {};
for (const [itemId, quantity] of fittingManager.playerInventory) {
    const fittedCount = fittedItemCounts.get(itemId) || 0;
    const totalQuantity = quantity + fittedCount;
    if (totalQuantity > 0) {
        serializedInventory[itemId] = totalQuantity;
    }
}

// AFTER (fixed):
const serializedInventory = {};

// Bug fix: First, add all fitted items to ensure they're in the serialized inventory
// This handles items that were fitted directly without ever being in playerInventory
for (const [itemId, fittedCount] of fittedItemCounts) {
    serializedInventory[itemId] = fittedCount;
}

// Then add items from playerInventory, combining with fitted counts
for (const [itemId, quantity] of fittingManager.playerInventory) {
    const fittedCount = fittedItemCounts.get(itemId) || 0;
    const totalQuantity = quantity + fittedCount;
    if (totalQuantity > 0) {
        serializedInventory[itemId] = totalQuantity;
    }
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Fitted items will now persist across browser sessions
- Items fitted directly from stations (without being in inventory first) will be restored correctly
- Items that exist in both inventory and as fitted will be correctly combined (total quantity preserved)
- The restoration flow will find all required items in the inventory during `fitItem()` calls

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low risk** - The change only affects the serialization order and completeness
- No modification to the restoration logic (deserializeShipFitting)
- No modification to the fitItem/unfitItem methods
- The fix ensures a superset of items are saved (fitted items + inventory items)
- Backwards compatible - old saves without this fix will still load correctly

**Testing Recommendations:**
1. Fit items to ship from station interface
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen game and verify fitted items are still present
4. Test with items that were:
   - Purchased and immediately fitted
   - Added to inventory then fitted
   - Partially in inventory and partially fitted
   - Multiple copies of same item fitted
