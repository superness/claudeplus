Perfect! The reproduction script has been created and updated with **automated browser restart** capability. Here's what I've implemented:

## Ship Fitting Persistence Bug - Reproduction Script

**File:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`

### Key Features

✅ **FULLY AUTOMATED** - No manual steps required!
✅ **Browser Restart** - Automatically kills and relaunches Chrome with same user-data-dir
✅ **localStorage Persistence Test** - Verifies if fitted items persist across full browser restart
✅ **Evidence Collection** - Captures console logs, errors, and test results

### Test Flow

**Phase 1: Setup Fitted Items**
1. Find nearby station
2. Teleport ship within docking range
3. Dock at station
4. Add test items to inventory (Mining Laser, Afterburner)
5. Fit items to ship slots (high[0] and mid[0])
6. Verify items are fitted correctly

**Phase 2: Browser Restart (AUTOMATED!)**
7. Kill Chrome process
8. Relaunch Chrome with **same user-data-dir** (this preserves localStorage)
9. Reconnect test WebSocket client

**Phase 3: Verify Persistence**
10. Wait for game to reload
11. Dock at station again
12. Get fitted items and check if they persisted

**BUG REPRODUCTION:**
- ✅ If fitted items are **LOST** after restart → **BUG REPRODUCED**
- ❌ If fitted items are **STILL THERE** after restart → Bug NOT reproduced (working correctly)

### Technical Implementation

The script uses ChromeManager's `restartBrowser` custom command which:
- Kills the Chrome process gracefully
- Waits 2 seconds for cleanup
- Relaunches with `preserveProfile: true` flag
- This ensures **same user-data-dir** is used, making localStorage persist
- Reconnects the WebSocket test client after restart

This is a **STRONGER TEST** than just refreshing the page (F5) because it tests full browser restart, which is what the bug report describes.

### Running the Test

```bash
cd /mnt/c/github/superstarships
node test_ship_fitting_persistence.js
```

The script will:
- Launch Chrome with test mode enabled
- Execute all test steps automatically
- Restart the browser mid-test
- Report whether the bug was reproduced or not
- Save evidence to `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json`

**DECISION: script_ready**
