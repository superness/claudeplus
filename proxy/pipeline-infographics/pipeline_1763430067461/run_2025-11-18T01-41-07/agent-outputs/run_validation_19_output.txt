## Test Results Summary

**BUG SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED ✅**

### What the test did:
1. ✅ Launched Chrome with test mode enabled
2. ✅ Teleported ship near Mining Station 6
3. ✅ Docked at station
4. ✅ Added test items to inventory (Mining Laser + Afterburner)
5. ✅ Fitted items to ship slots (high[0] and mid[0])
6. ✅ Verified items were fitted correctly before restart
7. ✅ **Killed and relaunched Chrome** with same user-data-dir (localStorage persists)
8. ✅ Waited for game to reload
9. ✅ Retrieved fitted items after restart

### Bug Evidence:
- **Before restart:** high[0] = "basic_mining_laser", mid[0] = "basic_afterburner"
- **After restart:** high[0] = null, mid[0] = null
- **Conclusion:** Ship fitted items do NOT persist across browser restarts

### Root Cause Analysis (from implement_fix stage):
The fix implemented reduced auto-save interval from 30s to 2s in `SaveGameManager.js`. The bug occurred because:
- Auto-save was only running every 30 seconds
- When browser restarted immediately after fitting items, the save hadn't run yet
- Fitted items were lost because they weren't saved to localStorage

### Test Infrastructure:
- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` (no caching)
- ✅ Chrome launched with correct flags
- ✅ Console logs captured (5 entries)
- ✅ Evidence file generated with complete test data
- ✅ WebSocket communication working
- ✅ Browser restart functionality working correctly

**DECISION: execution_complete**
