## Summary

**Test Status:** FRAMEWORK_ERROR (Infrastructure issue during browser restart)

**What Happened:**
1. ✅ **Phase 1 Successful** - Test successfully fitted items to the ship:
   - Mining Laser fitted to high slot 0
   - Afterburner fitted to mid slot 0
   - Items confirmed via `getFittedItems` command

2. ❌ **Phase 2 Failed** - Browser restart encountered infrastructure issue:
   - Chrome process was killed successfully
   - Game WebSocket disconnected (expected)
   - Chrome failed to reconnect after relaunch
   - Test could not verify if fitted items persisted

**Evidence Collected:**
- Console logs captured (5 entries, all Chrome GCM errors)
- 9 commands executed successfully before restart
- Fitted items verified before restart
- No post-restart verification possible due to disconnection

**Root Cause:**
The test framework issue occurred during the browser restart phase. The ChromeManager killed the browser correctly, but the game WebSocket failed to reconnect when Chrome relaunched. This prevented the test from completing its post-restart verification.

**Next Steps Required:**
The test needs a more robust reconnection strategy after browser restart, or the game needs better WebSocket reconnection handling. The bug itself (ship fitting persistence) could not be verified due to this infrastructure limitation.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
