## Analysis

The reproduction test **partially succeeded** but encountered a framework error:

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Fitting (SUCCESS)
- Successfully docked at station
- Added Mining Laser and Afterburner to inventory
- Fitted both items to ship slots
- **Verified items were fitted correctly**:
  - High slot 0: `basic_mining_laser`
  - Mid slot 0: `basic_afterburner`

### ❌ Phase 2: Browser Restart (FRAMEWORK ERROR)
- Chrome process was killed successfully
- **But Chrome didn't restart properly**
- WebSocket connection lost (code: 1006)
- Test couldn't proceed to Phase 3

### ⚠️ Phase 3: Verification (NOT REACHED)
- Could not test if fitted items persisted after restart
- Evidence shows `fittedItemsAfterRestart: null`

### Console Logs
The console log file exists and was captured successfully (2.4MB file), but the errors shown are Chrome internal GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) errors, not related to the ship fitting bug.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The test infrastructure encountered an issue with the automated browser restart functionality. The test successfully verified that items **can be fitted** (Phase 1), but we couldn't complete the full persistence test because Chrome didn't restart properly after being killed. This is a ChromeManager issue, not a game bug issue.
