  "bugSummary": "Ship fitted items do not persist across browser sessions - fitted equipment is lost on game reload",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a player fits modules/equipment to their ship, closes the browser, and reopens the game, the fitted items should still be installed on the ship. The ship fitting state should be saved to localStorage and restored on game load.",
  "actualBehavior": "When the browser is closed and reopened, all fitted items are lost and the ship returns to its default/unfitted state. The ship fitting configuration is not being saved or restored.",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship_fitting", "persistence", "localStorage", "game_save_load"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open the game in browser (http://localhost:8080 or via npm run dev)",
    "Step 2: Navigate to a station and dock",
    "Step 3: Open the ship fitting interface (ShipFittingUI)",
    "Step 4: Fit multiple modules/equipment to the ship (weapons, mining lasers, cargo expanders, etc.)",
    "Step 5: Verify the fitted items appear in the ship fitting interface",
    "Step 6: Close the browser tab/window completely",
    "Step 7: Reopen the game in a new browser session",
    "Step 8: Navigate to station and open ship fitting interface",
    "Step 9: Observe that all fitted items are gone - ship is in default state"

  "hypothesis": "The ShipFittingManager.js or ShipFittingUI.js likely handles fitting items to ships but does not implement save/restore logic. Either: (1) The fitted items are stored in memory only and never serialized to localStorage, (2) The save logic exists but is not being called at the right time, or (3) The restore logic is missing or not being invoked during game initialization. Need to examine ShipFittingManager.js for saveState()/loadState() methods and check if SpaceshipSimulator.js calls these methods during init/shutdown."
