  "reasoning": "User explicitly reports that ships are 'instantly jumping to throttle speed instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually'. This describes broken behavior - the physics system is not working as intended. The expected behavior is smooth acceleration/deceleration, but the current behavior is instant velocity changes. This is a clear physics bug that needs investigation and fixing.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "The user reports that ships are instantly jumping to throttle speed instead of accelerating and decelerating gradually. This is a physics/movement issue that needs investigation and fixing. Review the ship movement and throttle control code, identify where velocity changes are being applied instantly, and implement proper acceleration/deceleration mechanics so ships smoothly ramp up to target speed and smoothly slow down when throttle is reduced. The change should feel natural and give the player better control over ship momentum.",
