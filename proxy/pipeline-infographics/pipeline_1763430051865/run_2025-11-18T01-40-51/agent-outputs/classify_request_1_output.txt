  "reasoning": "The user explicitly labels this as a 'Bug Report' and describes a clear malfunction: ship fitted items are not persisting across game sessions. This is a broken feature where data that should be saved is being lost. The expected behavior (items should persist) is not happening, which is the definition of a bug. The user describes the problem ('fitted items are lost'), the expected behavior ('should save to localStorage'), and requests investigation and fixing ('identify why' and 'implement proper persistence').",

    "originalRequest": "Bug Report: Ship fitted items are not persisting across game sessions. When the user closes the browser and reopens it, the fitted items (equipment installed on the ship) are lost and the ship returns to its default state. The game should save the fitted items to localStorage or another persistence mechanism and restore them when the game loads. Investigate the ship fitting system, identify why fitted items aren't being saved/restored, and implement proper persistence so fitted items survive browser restarts.",
