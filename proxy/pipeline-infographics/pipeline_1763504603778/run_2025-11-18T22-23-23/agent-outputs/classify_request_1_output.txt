I'll analyze this request to classify it appropriately.

**Analysis:**

**Key Indicators:**
- "Add a 'Reset Player State' option" - indicates new functionality
- "to the debug menu" - specific target location (existing system)
- "completely resets the player's state" - new feature capability
- "include proper confirmation or warning" - additional UI logic required

**Classification Reasoning:**

This is a **FEATURE_REQUEST** because:

1. **Adding New Functionality**: While the debug menu already exists, this request adds a new capability that doesn't currently exist - a complete player state reset function.

2. **Not a Bug Fix**: Nothing is broken; this is an enhancement to the debug menu.

3. **Not a Quick Change**: This requires:
   - Creating a new reset function with comprehensive logic
   - Identifying all player state components (progress, stats, inventory, position, localStorage, etc.)
   - Adding UI element to debug menu
   - Implementing confirmation dialog
   - Testing to ensure complete reset
   - This is multi-file, multi-step work (likely 30+ lines across multiple files)

4. **Not a Refactor**: This adds new behavior rather than improving existing code structure.

5. **Clear Feature Request Language**: "Add a..." is a classic feature request pattern.

**Context Analysis:**
```json
{
  "classification": "FEATURE_REQUEST",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "Request explicitly asks to 'add' new functionality to the debug menu. Requires creating new reset logic, UI elements, confirmation dialogs, and comprehensive state management - far beyond a simple change. This is a new feature enhancement to the debug system.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Add a 'Reset Player State' option to the debug menu that completely resets the player's state and starts them over from the beginning. This should reset all player progress, stats, inventory, position, and any other persistent data back to initial values. The option should be clearly labeled in the debug menu and include proper confirmation or warning before executing.",
    "keyIndicators": ["add", "option", "reset", "debug menu", "confirmation"],
    "affectedArea": "debug menu system, player state management, localStorage, inventory system, progression system",
    "priority": "medium",
    "implementationScope": "New reset function, debug menu UI update, confirmation dialog, state management across multiple systems",
    "estimatedComplexity": "medium - requires coordination across player state, economy, inventory, progression, and localStorage systems"
