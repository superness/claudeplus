Based on my comprehensive search through all the design documentation, I can now provide the final requirements extraction report.

## Feature: Character Creation Screen

### Design Documentation Status: PARTIALLY SPECIFIED

Searched all design docs. **Character creation IS referenced** in player-experience.md as the first player interaction (00:00-05:00), and the API specification provides technical details. However, **many UI/UX specifications are NOT defined**.

---

### Specifications from Design Docs

#### 1. **Player Experience Flow** (player-experience.md:45-51)

```
00:00-05:00 - Character Creation
├── Select Faction: Imperial (clear 40K aesthetics guide choice)
├── Select Class: Battle Sister (matches her goal)
├── Brief faction lore establishes context

**Authentication:**
- User must be authenticated before character creation (JWT token required)

- **AMBIGUITY:** Does authentication happen BEFORE character creation or AFTER? Design docs do not clarify.

#### 9. **Secondary Profession** - NOT DURING CREATION

**Explicit Design** (progression-design.md:1489-1530):
- Secondary profession unlocks at **Level 5**, NOT during character creation
- Trial period system (Levels 5-8)
- Commitment decision at Level 8
- Character creation UI **should NOT** include secondary profession selection

#### 11. **Class Preview Specifications** - MENTIONED BUT NOT DETAILED

**From progression-design.md:1516-1521:**
> "Character creation shows all 12 classes briefly"

**MISSING SPECIFICATIONS:**
- ❌ Are all 12 classes shown at once, or just the 4 for selected faction?
- ❌ How are they previewed? (3D models? Gameplay video? Static art?)
- ❌ Role indicators format (Tank/DPS icon system?)
- ❌ "30 sec gameplay preview video" mentioned - what does it show?

### CRITICAL GAPS Requiring Design

Before implementation can begin, the following MUST be designed:

#### **GAP 1: Authentication Flow Timing**
- **Question:** Does authentication happen before or after character creation?
- **Evidence:** player-experience.md shows character creation at 00:00 (first interaction), but API requires JWT token
- **Needed:** Sequence diagram showing login → character creation → game world flow

#### **GAP 2: Appearance Customization Options**
- **Question:** How many options exist per category?
- **Missing:** Exact counts for face presets, hair styles, skin tones per faction
- **Missing:** Full list of scars and augments (are they faction-specific?)
- **Missing:** Do Orks have different options than Imperial/Tau? (teeth vs. hair?)

#### **GAP 3: Character Creation Screen Layout**
- **Question:** What does the UI actually look like?
- **Missing:** Wireframes or mockups
- **Missing:** Guild Wars 1 reference comparison
- **Missing:** Button placement, step flow, visual hierarchy

#### **GAP 4: Faction Lore Presentation**
- **Question:** How is "brief faction lore" shown?
- **Missing:** Lore text content
- **Missing:** Presentation method (popup? tooltip? narration?)
- **Missing:** Length (how brief is "brief"?)

#### **GAP 5: Starting Zone Assignments**
- **Question:** What are the exact starting zones for all factions?
- **Specified:** SCHOLA_PROGENIUM (Imperial - but this is a TRAINING ARENA, not starting zone)
- **Specified:** "Shrine World" (player-experience.md) - but no zone ID
- **Specified:** "Sept Colony" and "Rok Crash Site" - but no zone IDs or specifics
- **Missing:** Actual zone_id values for character creation

#### **GAP 6: Transition to Game World**
- **Question:** What happens after character creation completes?
- **From player-experience.md:53-61:** "05:00-15:00 - Tutorial Begins (Shrine World)" with "Cinematic establishes war context"
- **Missing:** Is there a cinematic between creation and gameplay? What's in it?
- **Missing:** Loading screen? Fade transition?

#### **GAP 7: Class Preview System**
- **Question:** How are classes showcased during selection?
- **Missing:** All 12 at once, or just 4 for selected faction?
- **Missing:** Preview method (3D models, videos, static art)
- **Missing:** Role/archetype labels
- **Missing:** Preview video content

#### **GAP 8: Audio Specifications**
- **Question:** What sounds play during character creation?
- **Mentioned:** "Faction-specific ambient music during creation"
- **Missing:** Specific music style per faction
- **Missing:** Button click sounds, confirmation sounds
- **Missing:** Faction selection audio cues

---

### What CAN Be Implemented

Despite the gaps, the following can be implemented with current specifications:

✅ **Three-faction system** with exact names and codes
✅ **12 classes** with exact names, codes, and visual silhouettes
✅ **Faction color schemes** (hex codes provided)
✅ **Character naming** validation (complete regex pattern)
✅ **API integration** (endpoint, request/response structure)
✅ **Appearance data structure** (JSON format known)
✅ **3D rendering requirements** (polycount, texture resolution)
✅ **Camera perspective** (third-person, Guild Wars 1 style)
✅ **Zero-friction design goal** (no secondary profession at creation)

### Recommendation

**Character creation CAN be implemented** for the core flow (faction → class → name → appearance structure → API call), BUT the following **MUST be designed FIRST**:

1. **Appearance options enumeration** (how many faces, hairs, etc.)
2. **UI layout mockups** (what does it actually look like?)
3. **Faction lore text and presentation method**
4. **Starting zone IDs** (exact values for all three factions)
5. **Class preview system** (how to showcase 12 classes)
6. **Audio specifications** (what plays during creation)
7. **Authentication flow timing** (before or after character creation?)
8. **Transition to game world** (cinematic? loading? fade?)

**Without these specifications, implementation will require placeholder decisions that may not match intended design.**
