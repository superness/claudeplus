Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile the final decision:

## Next Feature: Character Creation Screen

### Already Implemented

The client has a complete working game with:
- 3D game engine with third-person camera (Guild Wars 1 style)
- Full combat system with 8+1 skill bar
- Party management (companions/henchmen)
- Enemy AI and spawning
- Loot system with drops and pickups
- Audio system (music + SFX)
- Complete UI (health/energy bars, skill bar, party frames, minimap, chat)
- Skills panel with skill trees and training
- Secondary profession panel with trial system
- Weight of Choice tutorial quest (Level 3)
- Proving Grounds training arena
- Network manager for backend communication

**However**, the game currently:
- Starts directly in the game world (main.ts:65-86 initializes Game directly)
- Uses hardcoded character data ("Brother Titus, Lv. 15 Crusader" in index.html:40-41)
- Has NO character creation flow
- Has NO login/authentication UI
- Has NO faction selection
- Has NO class selection
- Has NO appearance customization

### From Design Docs

The player-experience.md document (lines 45-51) explicitly defines character creation as the **FIRST** player interaction:

```
00:00-05:00 - Character Creation
├── Select Faction: Imperial (clear 40K aesthetics guide choice)
├── Select Class: Battle Sister (matches her goal)
├── Brief faction lore establishes context
├── Customize appearance
├── EMOTIONAL STATE: Excited, curious
└── FRICTION: None (straightforward, good UI)
```

**Critical requirements:**
1. Faction selection (Imperial/Tau/Ork) - 3 factions with distinct 40K aesthetics
2. Class selection (4 classes per faction = 12 total classes)
3. Faction lore presentation to establish context
4. Appearance customization
5. Character naming
6. Tutorial flow after creation

The design emphasizes this is a **zero-friction experience** that should excite and engage players immediately.

### Why This Feature Next

**This is the CORE entry point** to the game - without character creation:
- Players cannot properly enter the game world
- No faction/class choice (fundamental to identity)
- No onboarding flow
- Cannot test the designed new player experience
- Backend character creation API exists but has no client UI

**Priority Reasoning:**
1. **Dependency**: ALL other features assume a character exists with proper faction/class
2. **Core mechanic**: Character identity is fundamental to an MMO
3. **Design alignment**: Player-experience.md identifies this as minute 0:00-05:00
4. **Backend ready**: Character creation endpoints exist in the API
5. **Blocks nothing**: Can be built standalone without dependencies

This is not just a feature - it's the **gateway** to the game. Without it, players cannot properly engage with the 40K universe, make meaningful choices, or experience the intended onboarding journey.
