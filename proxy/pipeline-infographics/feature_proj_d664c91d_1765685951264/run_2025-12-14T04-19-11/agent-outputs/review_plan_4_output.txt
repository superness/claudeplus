Perfect! Now I have enough context to conduct a thorough review. Let me analyze the requirements:

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Critical Missing Information

#### 1. **Authentication Flow Missing from Character Creation Flow**
The extracted requirements state:
> "User must be authenticated before character creation"

However, the design docs show character creation as minute 0:00-05:00 of the player experience (player-experience.md:45-51), which is the **FIRST** interaction. The requirements don't address:
- Is there a separate login/registration screen before character creation?
- Or does the user authenticate AFTER character creation?
- How does the demo/trial flow work?

#### 2. **Missing Visual Specifications for Character Creation UI**
The visual-combat-design.md document provides extensive faction color schemes (lines 48-120), but the extracted requirements don't specify:
- What does the character creation screen itself look like?
- Full-screen? In-game world preview? Guild Wars 1-style interface?
- Background visuals (Is the character on a pedestal? In a preview scene?)
- UI layout (step-by-step wizard? Single page with tabs?)

The requirements say "Full-screen character creation interface" but lack:
- Specific layout inspired by Guild Wars 1
- Gothic 40K UI aesthetic details
- How faction colors integrate into the UI chrome

#### 3. **Appearance Customization Specifics Missing**
The requirements correctly identify the API structure for appearance data, but note:
> "The following were NOT found in design docs and should NOT be implemented without further design:
> - Exact number of face presets, hair styles, skin tones
> - Specific scar options list
> - Specific augment options list"

This is a **RED FLAG**. We need actual specifications for:
- How many face presets per faction?
- Hair style options (considering helmets/40K aesthetic)?
- Are augments faction-specific (Imperial bionics vs. Tau implants vs. Ork cyborks)?
- Do Orks even have "hair_style" options, or should this be teeth/tusks?

#### 4. **Character Model Preview Technical Specifications**
The requirements state:
> "Real-time 3D character preview with rotation"

But lack technical details found in visual-combat-design.md:
- Model polycount for character creation (15,000-25,000 tris per visual-combat-design.md:833)
- Texture resolution (2048x2048, line 843)
- Lighting setup for preview
- Camera angle/distance matching Guild Wars 1 style
- Which Three.js rendering features (PBR materials? Bloom? Outline?)

#### 5. **Faction Lore Presentation Missing**
The requirements note:
> "Brief faction lore establishes context"

But don't specify:
- How is lore presented? (Text popup? Voiceover? Video?)
- Actual lore text content (references player-experience.md but doesn't quote it)
- "For the Emperor" vs "For the Greater Good" vs "WAAAGH!" flavor moments

#### 6. **Class Preview Specifications Incomplete**
The requirements mention progression-design.md:1516-1521 for class preview features:
> "Character creation shows all 12 classes briefly"

But don't detail:
- Are all 12 classes shown at once, or just the 4 for selected faction?
- How are they previewed? (3D models? Gameplay video? Static art?)
- Role indicators format (Tank/DPS icon system?)
- The "30 sec gameplay preview video" mentioned in docs

#### 7. **Starting Zone Assignment Logic Missing**
The requirements state:
> "Each faction has specific starting zones"

But only provide one example (SCHOLA_PROGENIUM for Imperial). The data model needs:
- What are Tau starting zones? (Sept-specific, but which Septs?)
- What are Ork starting zones? (Rok-specific, but which Roks?)
- Is starting zone selectable, or automatically assigned based on race/class?

#### 8. **Transition to Game World Undefined**
The requirements mention:
> "Transition to game world on completion"

But player-experience.md:53-61 shows:
> "05:00-15:00 - Tutorial Begins (Shrine World)  
> ├── Cinematic establishes war context"

Is there a cinematic between character creation and gameplay? What does it show?

#### 9. **Audio Specifications Incomplete**
Requirements mention:
> "Faction-specific ambient music during creation"

But lack:
- Specific music style (Gregorian chants for Imperial? Symphonic for Tau? Heavy drums for Orks?)
- Audio cues for each step of character creation
- Confirmation sound specifics

#### 10. **Missing Guild Wars 1 Reference Screenshots**
The entire feature is supposed to "look and feel like Guild Wars 1" but the requirements don't reference:
- Specific Guild Wars 1 character creation screenshots for UI layout inspiration
- Which aspects of GW1 character creation to emulate vs. adapt

### Ambiguities Requiring Clarification

**A. Character Limit Enforcement**
- Requirements mention "max 8 characters per account" but where is this checked in the flow?
- What happens if user is at limit? (Error before creation starts? Or at submit?)

**B. Secondary Profession During Creation**
- Requirements correctly note secondary profession is NOT selected during creation
- But should the UI mention it? ("You'll unlock secondary class at Level 5")

**C. Faction Color Scheme Application**
- The faction colors are specified for combat (visual-combat-design.md:48-120)
- But how do these apply to character creation UI? (Button colors? Background gradients? Border accents?)

### What IS Correct

The requirements successfully captured:
- ✅ Three factions with accurate names and codes
- ✅ 12 classes (4 per faction) with correct names
- ✅ Character naming validation rules (exact pattern match)
- ✅ API endpoint specification (POST /api/v1/characters)
- ✅ Character creation is zero-friction experience (minute 0-5)
- ✅ Backend error handling requirements
- ✅ Starting currency (500 Thrones)
- ✅ Faction color palettes (hex codes accurate)
- ✅ Silhouette recognition requirements (visual-combat-design.md:850-946)
- ✅ Third-person camera perspective requirement

### Docs to Re-Examine

1. **player-experience.md** - Reread lines 1-150 for:
   - Authentication flow timing
   - Character creation detailed experience
   - Transition to tutorial

2. **visual-combat-design.md** - Reread lines 1-50, 800-1000 for:
   - UI aesthetic guidelines
   - Character model technical requirements
   - Environment rendering for character preview

3. **data-model.md** - Search for:
   - Complete list of starting zones per faction
   - Appearance customization validation rules
   - Character creation flow state machine

4. **api-specification.md** - Check:
   - Character creation prerequisites (auth? account checks?)
   - Appearance data validation rules
   - Error response details

5. **Look for MISSING DOCS**:
   - Is there a UI/UX design document?
   - Is there a character creation specific design doc?
   - Asset specifications document?

### Specific Questions for Design Docs

Before implementation can begin, we need answers to:
1. What does the character creation screen LOOK like? (Layout, not just colors)
2. How many appearance options exist per category?
3. Where does authentication happen relative to character creation?
4. What are all starting zones for all factions?
5. Is there a cinematic transition? What's in it?
6. Should all 12 classes be shown, or just the 4 for selected faction?
