## Current State

**Client exists:** YES
- Full-featured 3D game client in `/client` directory
- Built with Three.js (3D engine), Vite (bundler), TypeScript
- index.html with complete UI layout (skill bar, party frames, chat, minimap)
- Comprehensive game systems already implemented

**Design docs:** Extensive documentation
- combat-design.md
- balance-analysis.md
- progression-design.md
- henchmen-heroes-design.md
- visual-combat-design.md
- testing-arena-design.md

- Repository pattern, validation service, migrations/seeds
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Client code:** Fully functional game
- Game.ts: Main game loop, scene management, Three.js renderer
- Player.ts: Third-person character controller
- ThirdPersonCamera.ts: Guild Wars 1-style camera
- CombatSystem.ts: Full skill-based combat with 8+1 elite slots

**Can run:** YES
- Backend: `npm run dev` (server working directory)
- Client: `npm run dev` in `/client` directory
- Vite dev server for hot-reload development

## Recommendation

The game client is **FULLY BUILT** and operational. You have a complete 3D MMO client with:
- Guild Wars 1-style third-person perspective
- 8+1 skill bar system
- Companion/henchmen party system
- Combat with visual effects, damage numbers, buffs/debuffs
- Training arena with test dummies
- Enemy AI and spawning
- Loot system with pickups
- Audio system (music + SFX)
- Full UI (health/energy bars, skill bar, party frames, minimap, chat)

The project is far beyond "needs setup" - it's a complete, functioning game that just needs feature additions or refinements.
