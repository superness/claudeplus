THE CRITICAL "AHA!" MOMENT

LEVEL 10: FULL 8-SKILL BAR

What happens:
├── Player has accumulated 12-15 skills
├── Skill bar caps at 8 slots

├── Build philosophy crystallizes
├── Choice becomes the game

Why it works:
├── Constraint creates meaning
├── Every skill selection matters
├── Builds become player identity
├── Theorycrafting community forms
├── GW1 veterans feel at home

Design success:
├── Properly set up by "Weight of Choice" at Level 3
├── Player expects this moment, embraces it
├── NOT a surprise limitation but an anticipated feature
└── Converts potential frustration into engagement
