Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Let me write my comprehensive review:

## Review: NEEDS MORE DETAIL

### Critical Issues Found

After thoroughly reviewing the extracted requirements against the original design documents (`character-creation-ui-design.md`, `player-experience.md`, and `api-specification.md`), I've identified **significant gaps** that would lead to an incomplete implementation.

### Missing Information

#### 1. **Missing Complete Faction & Class Data**

The requirements state there are **12 classes (4 per faction)** but only provide **generic descriptions**. The design doc `character-creation-ui-design.md` (lines 377-628) contains **complete specifications** for each class that are missing:

- **Missing per-class technical data**: Starting weapons, armor types, base stats, health modifiers, energy modifiers
- **Missing class role mechanics**: Tank/DPS/Healer/Hybrid role indicators and what they mean
- **Missing class-specific augment restrictions**: E.g., Tech-Priest gets "Gun Servitor" and "Servitor Skulls", Crisis Suit gets "Helmet Integration"

Example of what's missing for Battle Sister (lines 381-399):
```
Base Armor: 150
Health Modifier: 1.20
Base Energy: 60
Energy Regen: 3.0
Key Skills: Holy Strike, Resurrection, Emperor's Wrath (with damage types and mechanics)
```

#### 2. **Incomplete Appearance System Specifications**

The extracted requirements mention appearance options but **lack the data structure** needed for implementation:

- **Missing: How appearance data is stored/transmitted** (What's the JSON structure for the appearance object?)
- **Missing: Augment mutual exclusivity rules** (Can you have both bionic eyes? Which augments conflict?)
- **Missing: Default appearances per class** (What does a fresh Battle Sister look like?)
- **Missing: Appearance validation rules** (Which combos are invalid?)

From `character-creation-ui-design.md` lines 699-847, there are **detailed appearance schemas** not captured:

```yaml
IMPERIAL APPEARANCE:
  FACE:
    face_preset: int (1-12)
    skin_tone: int (1-8) # Maps to specific hex codes
    age_marks: int (0-3)
  HAIR:
    hair_style: int (1-16)
    hair_color: string (hex code)
    facial_hair: int (0-8) # masculine only, null for feminine
  SCARS:
    facial_scars: array[string] # max 3, codes like "left_eye"
    body_scars: array[string] # max 8
  AUGMENTS:
    bionic_eyes: enum["none", "left", "right", "both"]
    bionic_limbs: varies by class
    purity_seals: boolean
```

This **data structure** is essential for API integration but isn't in the requirements.

#### 3. **3D Asset Pipeline Not Specified**

The requirements mention "15k-25k tris, 2048x2048 textures" but **don't specify**:

- **Model file format**: .glb? .gltf? FBX with conversion?
- **Texture atlas layout**: How are face/hair/armor textures combined?
- **Real-time customization approach**: Texture swapping? Material parameters? Mesh blending?
- **Asset loading strategy**: All 12 classes preloaded? Progressive? CDN structure?

From lines 1349-1387, the design doc specifies **technical rendering requirements** that need asset pipeline decisions:
- PBR metallic-roughness workflow (requires specific texture channels)
- Progressive texture streaming (low-res → high-res strategy)
- Model caching strategy

#### 4. **Step Flow State Machine Missing**

Requirements list 5 steps but **don't define**:

- **Can users skip steps?** (e.g., jump from Step 2 to Step 4?)
- **What triggers "Weight of Choice" tutorial?** (The requirements mention it but don't say when it fires in the character creation flow)
- **Session persistence**: If user closes browser mid-creation, what's saved?
- **Back button behavior**: Does going back clear Step 5 confirmation checkbox?

#### 5. **Audio Asset Specifications Incomplete**

Requirements mention "Faction music crossfades with 2s blend" but **lack**:

- **Audio file format**: OGG? MP3? WebAudio API compatible formats?
- **Music track lengths**: How long are faction themes to enable seamless looping?
- **Crossfade implementation**: Linear fade? Exponential? Equal-power?
- **SFX trigger mapping**: Which UI events trigger which sounds? (Requirements list sound types but not trigger logic)

From lines 1224-1321, the design doc has **detailed audio system architecture** including:
- Base layer + faction layer mixing (20% base, faction layers crossfade)
- Specific instrument specifications per faction
- Volume balance requirements (Music 20%, SFX 50%, Confirmation 40%)

### Specifications Verified as Correct

✅ API endpoint structure (`POST /api/v1/characters`) matches `api-specification.md` lines 356-419  
✅ Name validation regex `^[A-Z][a-zA-Z\s'-]{2,29}$` matches line 943  
✅ Step-by-step flow (5 steps) matches lines 111-144  
✅ 3 factions, 12 classes structure is correct  
✅ 3D preview technical specs (WebGL 2.0, Three.js, 60 FPS target) match lines 1349-1387  
✅ Responsive design breakpoints (1280x720 min, 1920x1080 optimal) match lines 1391-1425  

### Docs to Check (Re-reading Required)

**Priority 1 - Blocking Implementation:**
1. `character-creation-ui-design.md` lines 377-847 → Extract complete class/appearance data schemas
2. `api-specification.md` lines 356-419 → Extract exact JSON request/response structures
3. `character-creation-ui-design.md` lines 1224-1387 → Extract audio/rendering asset specifications

**Priority 2 - Polish & Edge Cases:**
4. `player-experience.md` lines 43-137 → Extract tutorial trigger logic
5. `character-creation-ui-design.md` lines 1474-1554 → Extract testing requirements

### Why This Matters

The current requirements would lead to an implementation where:
- ❌ **Developers guess at data structures** → API integration fails
- ❌ **Artists create wrong asset formats** → 3D preview broken
- ❌ **Audio team delivers incompatible files** → Music system fails
- ❌ **QA can't validate against specs** → Bugs ship to production

The requirements capture the **"what"** (features) but miss the **"how"** (implementation details) needed for a working system.
