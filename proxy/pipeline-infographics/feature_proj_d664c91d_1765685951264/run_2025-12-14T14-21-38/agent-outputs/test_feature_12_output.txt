The integration path is complete. Let me create the test results summary:

## Test Results: Character Creation UI System

### Feature Being Tested
Complete 5-step Character Creation UI (Faction → Class → Appearance → Name → Confirm) with:
- 3-column layout with 40K aesthetic styling
- All 12 classes across 3 factions (Imperial/Tau/Ork)
- Faction-specific appearance options
- Name validation with regex pattern
- Three.js 3D character preview
- API integration for character submission

### Syntax Check
**PASS** - Build completed successfully
- TypeScript compilation: ✓ No errors (`tsc --noEmit` clean)
- Vite build: ✓ 46 modules transformed, dist built in 6.15s
- No syntax errors in changed files

### Integration Path
- **Entry point**: `main.ts:202` - `shouldShowCharacterCreation()` checks URL params or localStorage
- **Chain**: `init()` → `shouldShowCharacterCreation()` → `initCharacterCreation(networkManager)` → `new CharacterCreation()` → `characterCreation.init(networkManager)`
- **Character Creation internal flow**: `init()` → `createUI()` → `updateUI()` → `updateLeftPanel()/updateRightPanel()` → step-specific renderers
- **Submission chain**: `handleNext()` → `submitCharacter()` → `POST /api/v1/characters` → `onComplete()` callback → `initGame()`
- **Target reached**: YES
- **CONNECTED: YES**

### Verification Points
1. ✓ CharacterCreation module properly exported from `index.ts`
2. ✓ Imported in `main.ts` and instantiated correctly
3. ✓ CSS linked in `index.html` (`/src/styles/character-creation.css`)
4. ✓ All data exports present in CharacterCreationData.ts (FACTIONS, CLASSES, APPEARANCE_OPTIONS, etc.)
5. ✓ All 5 step render functions implemented (renderFactionSelection, renderClassSelection, renderAppearanceOptions, renderNameEntry, renderConfirmation)
6. ✓ updateUI() routes to correct step renderer via switch statement
7. ✓ submitCharacter() properly sends POST to `/api/v1/characters`
8. ✓ onComplete/onCancel callbacks connected to game flow
9. ✓ Vite dev server serves all modules correctly (verified via curl)

### Issues Found
None affecting this feature. The build warning about chunk size (934KB) is informational only and does not affect functionality.
