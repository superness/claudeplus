UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the daemon_pool_connector agent based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will establish and validate the RPC connection between the daemon and pool, including configuration, testing, authentication validation, network verification, and monitoring.

APPROACH: 
1. Read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 requirements
2. Examine existing agent patterns in the /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/ directory
3. Design the agent JSON structure with appropriate permissions, decisions, and workflow
4. Create configuration for daemon RPC connection establishment
5. Define validation steps for connectivity, authentication, and network matching
6. Implement monitoring logic for RPC call success/failure tracking

STEPS:
1) Read /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md using Read tool to extract section 2.2 specifications
2) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/*.json to understand the agent structure pattern
3) Read 2-3 example agent JSONs to understand the schema (name, description, permissions, decisions, workflow, etc.)
4) Design the daemon_pool_connector agent JSON with:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["read", "write", "edit", "bash", "glob", "grep"]
   - Decisions array: ["connection_established", "connection_failed", "rpc_validated", "error"]
   - Workflow sections for:
     * Reading pool configuration for daemon RPC settings
     * Establishing RPC connection to daemon
     * Testing getinfo RPC call
     * Testing getblocktemplate RPC call
     * Validating authentication credentials
     * Verifying network type matches (regtest)
     * Monitoring and logging RPC call results
   - Error handling for connection failures
   - Success criteria and exit conditions
5) Write the complete agent JSON to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json using Write tool
6) Validate JSON syntax is correct

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Handle missing or invalid daemon RPC configuration (host, port, username, password)
- Test authentication failure scenarios
- Test network mismatch (e.g., daemon on mainnet vs pool expecting regtest)
- Handle daemon not running or unreachable
- Test timeout scenarios for RPC calls
- Verify proper error messages for each failure mode
- Test successful connection with valid credentials on correct network
- Ensure monitoring captures both successful and failed RPC attempts

EVIDENCE:
- Content of section 2.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing exact requirements
- Example agent JSON structure from existing agents
- Complete daemon_pool_connector.json file with all required fields
- JSON structure validation showing proper syntax
- Mapping between plan requirements and agent workflow steps

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The task is well-defined with specific requirements, permissions, and decisions listed. Success depends on understanding the existing agent pattern structure and accurately translating section 2.2 requirements into the JSON workflow format. Uncertainty exists around the exact JSON schema format used by this agent system, but examining existing agents will clarify this.
