Perfect! The agent JSON has been successfully created with comprehensive coverage. Let me create a summary document:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully created the **daemon_pool_connector** agent JSON file based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md.

### File Created
- **Path**: `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json`
- **Size**: 16KB (463 lines)
- **Format**: Valid JSON (verified with Python JSON parser)

### Requirements Coverage

All requirements from section 2.2 have been implemented:

✓ **Establish and validate daemon→pool RPC connection**
✓ **Configure pool's daemon RPC settings** (host, port, user, password)
✓ **Test RPC connectivity** (getinfo, getblocktemplate)
✓ **Validate authentication** (credential verification)
✓ **Verify network (regtest) match** (network compatibility check)
✓ **Monitor RPC call success/failure** (metrics tracking)

### Permissions
All required permissions granted:
- Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

### Decision Points
Four explicit decision points configured:
1. **connection_established** - Initial RPC connection works
2. **connection_failed** - Cannot connect after retries
3. **rpc_validated** - Full validation passed (both RPC calls succeed)
4. **error** - Critical/unexpected failures

### Key Features

**Configuration**:
- Daemon RPC settings (127.0.0.1:18443)
- Connection validation with retry logic (3 attempts)
- Health monitoring (30-second intervals)
- Timeout thresholds and failure tracking

**Comprehensive Structure**:
- 10 core responsibilities
- 6 RPC endpoints for agent control
- 5 test scenarios covering success and failure cases
- Detailed error handling for 6 error types
- Dependencies on bitcoin_daemon_manager and pool_server_manager
- Metrics collection and export
- Logging configuration with rotation

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Successful connection → rpc_validated
2. Daemon not running → connection_failed
3. Authentication failure → connection_failed
4. Network mismatch → error
5. Partial success (getblocktemplate fails) → connection_established

**Success Criteria**: 7 validation points including RPC call success, authentication, network verification, and response time checks.

The agent JSON follows the established schema pattern from existing agents (e.g., bitcoin_daemon_manager) while being specifically tailored for daemon-pool RPC integration as specified in the mining cycle automation plan.
