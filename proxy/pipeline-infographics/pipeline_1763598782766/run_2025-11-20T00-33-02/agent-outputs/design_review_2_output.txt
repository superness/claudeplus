ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding that the task involves creating an agent JSON file based on section 2.2 of a planning document
- Logical progression: read requirements → study existing patterns → design agent → write file
- Explicitly lists all required permissions and decisions from the user's requirements
- Addresses important test considerations (authentication failures, network mismatches, daemon unreachability)
- Plans to examine existing agents for schema consistency

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Missing Critical File Verification**: The plan assumes MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists but doesn't verify this first. If section 2.2 doesn't exist or is incomplete, the entire plan fails without fallback.

2. **Vague Workflow Design**: Step 4 lists high-level workflow sections ("Reading pool configuration", "Establishing RPC connection") but doesn't specify:
   - Exact JSON structure/schema for workflows
   - How workflows are defined (scripts? commands? declarative steps?)
   - How RPC calls are actually executed within the agent framework
   - How decisions are triggered/evaluated

3. **No Concrete Evidence Collection**: The "EVIDENCE" section lists what will be shown, but doesn't specify HOW this evidence proves correctness:
   - What specific validations will confirm the JSON is functionally correct?
   - How will we verify the agent actually works before considering the task complete?
   - No mention of testing the generated agent or validating it against a schema

4. **JSON Syntax Validation Only**: Step 6 only mentions validating JSON syntax, not semantic correctness or agent framework compatibility

5. **Unknown Schema Risk**: Acknowledges uncertainty about "exact JSON schema format" but confidence is still "Medium-High" - this seems overconfident given the schema is critical to success

6. **No Integration Verification**: Doesn't plan to verify that:
   - The agent file is in the correct location
   - The agent can be loaded by whatever system uses these agents
   - The permissions/decisions map correctly to the agent framework's expected format

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence only demonstrates that a JSON file was created with certain content, NOT that:
- The agent will actually function in the target system
- The workflow correctly implements section 2.2 requirements
- The RPC connection logic is properly structured
- The decisions trigger appropriately

Strong evidence would include:
- Schema validation against agent framework requirements
- Functional test or dry-run of the agent
- Side-by-side comparison showing all section 2.2 requirements are addressed
- Verification that the agent matches the pattern/structure of working agents

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:**
The plan lacks concrete verification steps to prove the generated agent will actually work. While it shows understanding of the high-level requirements, it doesn't demonstrate how to translate those into the specific JSON workflow format used by this agent system. The confidence level is not justified given the acknowledged uncertainty about the exact schema. The plan needs:

1. Explicit schema validation step (not just JSON syntax)
2. Detailed specification of how workflow steps are structured in the JSON
3. Concrete verification that each section 2.2 requirement maps to a workflow step
4. Either a test execution or comparison against known-working agent patterns to prove functional correctness

DECISION: REJECTED
