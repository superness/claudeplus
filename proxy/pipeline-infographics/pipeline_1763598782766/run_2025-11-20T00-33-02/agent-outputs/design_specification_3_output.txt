UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building the daemon_pool_connector agent JSON configuration file based on section 2.2 of the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md document. This agent needs to establish and validate RPC connections between a cryptocurrency daemon and mining pool.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.2 specifications
2. Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the structure and format used
3. Design the agent JSON with appropriate states, transitions, permissions, and decision points
4. Create the JSON structure including all RPC connection validation logic and test scenarios

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md focusing on section 2.2
2) Use Glob tool to find existing agent JSON files: pattern "agents/*.json" 
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing agent JSONs to understand the schema structure
4) Design the agent state machine with states:
   - initial: Starting state
   - configuring_rpc: Setting up daemon RPC configuration
   - testing_connectivity: Testing basic RPC calls (getinfo)
   - validating_auth: Verifying authentication credentials
   - testing_templates: Testing getblocktemplate RPC call
   - verifying_network: Confirming regtest network match
   - monitoring: Ongoing RPC health monitoring
   - connection_validated: Success terminal state
   - connection_error: Failure terminal state
5) Map transitions between states with appropriate conditions and decision points
6) Define permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
7) Define decision outcomes: ["connection_established", "connection_failed", "rpc_validated", "error"]
8) Add prompts/instructions for each state describing RPC validation tasks
9) Structure complete JSON following discovered schema format
10) Use Write tool to save to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Invalid credentials: Agent should detect authentication failures and transition to error state
- Network mismatch: Agent should verify regtest network and fail if daemon is on different network
- Unreachable daemon: Agent should handle connection timeouts and report connection_failed
- Partial RPC functionality: Test that both getinfo and getblocktemplate work, not just one
- Configuration validation: Ensure RPC host, port, username, password are all validated
- State transition logic: Verify each state can reach both success and failure outcomes appropriately

EVIDENCE:
- The complete daemon_pool_connector.json file content showing all states and transitions
- Reference to section 2.2 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md demonstrating requirement alignment
- Comparison with existing agent JSON schema to prove structural consistency
- List of all RPC validation checks included (getinfo, getblocktemplate, auth, network)
- Decision points mapped to required outcomes (connection_established, connection_failed, rpc_validated, error)

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a structured JSON creation task with clear requirements. Confidence is medium-high rather than high because:
1. Need to verify the exact schema format from existing agents
2. Section 2.2 content is unknown until read
3. RPC validation logic must align with cryptocurrency daemon specifics
However, the task is well-defined with clear inputs (requirements list) and outputs (JSON file location).
