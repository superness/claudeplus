ASSESSMENT:

The plan demonstrates a **clear and methodical understanding** of the task:
- Correctly identifies the need to read section 2.2 of the planning document
- Plans to examine existing agent JSON files to understand the schema
- Identifies all key technical requirements (RPC testing, authentication, network validation, monitoring)
- Includes comprehensive error handling considerations

The approach is **logical and well-structured**:
- Step 1-2: Research phase (read plan document, find existing examples)
- Step 3: Learning phase (examine agent JSON schema)
- Step 4: Design phase (create agent structure with all requirements)
- Step 5: Implementation phase (write the JSON file)

**Strengths:**
- Explicitly lists all required permissions and decision points from the user requirements
- Covers all technical requirements (getinfo/getblocktemplate testing, auth validation, network verification)
- Includes thoughtful test considerations (missing configs, auth failures, network mismatch, offline daemon)
- Plans to validate against actual documentation (section 2.2)
- Plans to use existing examples for schema consistency

**Concrete Evidence Proposed:**
1. References section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md for alignment
2. Examines existing agent JSON structure for format compatibility  
3. Creates complete daemon_pool_connector.json at specified path
4. Includes specific bash commands and validation checks in the JSON
5. Verifies correct file path

**Minor Considerations:**
- The plan doesn't explicitly state it will verify the JSON is valid/well-formed
- Doesn't mention what specific fields from section 2.2 it will validate against (though this may emerge during execution)

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong** 

The evidence is verifiable and concrete:
- The output file path is explicitly specified
- Can verify content matches section 2.2 requirements
- Can verify JSON schema matches existing agents
- Can verify all permissions and decisions are included
- The test considerations show deep thinking about failure modes

DECISION: APPROVED
