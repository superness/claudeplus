ASSESSMENT:

The plan shows a methodical approach to creating the daemon_pool_connector agent JSON, but has several critical weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies need to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.2 first
- Plans to examine existing agent JSON files to understand schema structure
- Lists appropriate permissions and decision outcomes matching requirements
- Comprehensive state machine design covering RPC connection lifecycle
- Good test considerations covering error scenarios

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Vague Evidence Collection**: The plan states it will provide "complete daemon_pool_connector.json file content" but doesn't specify HOW it will verify the JSON works correctly. Creating a file ≠ proving it functions.

2. **No Functional Validation**: Missing concrete steps to TEST the created agent JSON:
   - No mention of validating JSON syntax
   - No plan to verify the agent can actually be loaded/executed
   - No integration test with actual daemon/pool components
   - States are designed but no verification they transition correctly

3. **Schema Compliance Uncertainty**: While it plans to examine existing agents, there's no explicit verification step confirming the new JSON matches required schema. Just "comparison" is mentioned in evidence but not as a validation step.

4. **Missing Concrete Deliverables**: 
   - No sample RPC commands/responses to validate against
   - No specific config file locations to test with
   - No verification that permissions are sufficient for required operations

5. **Confidence Justification Weak**: "Medium-High" confidence is concerning given uncertainties about schema format and section 2.2 content. Should be lower or have mitigation steps.

**Evidence Quality Issues:**
- "Complete file content" - Weak (just shows file was written, not that it works)
- "Reference to section 2.2" - Weak (shows reading, not understanding/implementation)
- "Comparison with existing schema" - Weak (manual comparison without validation)
- "List of RPC validation checks" - Moderate (shows completeness but not correctness)

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence demonstrates file creation and structural compliance but provides NO verification that:
1. The agent JSON is syntactically valid
2. The state machine logic is sound
3. The agent can execute successfully
4. RPC validation actually works as intended

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasons:**
1. Missing functional validation steps - no plan to test the created agent works
2. Evidence focuses on creation artifacts, not operational proof
3. No verification mechanism for state transition logic
4. Cannot prove task completion without executing/testing the agent

**Required Revisions:**
- Add step to validate JSON syntax (e.g., using jq or JSON validator)
- Add step to dry-run/test the agent if framework supports it
- Include verification that all required RPC methods are properly configured
- Provide concrete test cases showing agent handles success/failure scenarios
- Lower confidence rating OR add discovery/validation steps to justify Medium-High

DECISION: REJECTED
