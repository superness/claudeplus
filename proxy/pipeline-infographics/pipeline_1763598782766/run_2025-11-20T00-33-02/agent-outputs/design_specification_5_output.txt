UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a complete agent JSON configuration file for `daemon_pool_connector` based on section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will handle establishing and validating RPC connections between daemon and pool, with specific decision points for connection status and RPC validation.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 2.2 requirements
2. Examine existing agent JSON files in the claudeplus/agents directory to understand the structure and format
3. Design the agent JSON with appropriate permissions, decision points, and instructions based on the requirements
4. Write the complete agent configuration to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` focusing on section 2.2
2) Use Glob tool to find existing agent JSON files: `claudeplus/agents/*.json`
3) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing agent JSON files to understand the schema and structure
4) Design the agent JSON structure including:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decision points: ["connection_established", "connection_failed", "rpc_validated", "error"]
   - Detailed instructions covering:
     * Reading pool configuration to get daemon RPC settings
     * Testing RPC connectivity with getinfo and getblocktemplate calls
     * Validating authentication credentials
     * Verifying network type matches regtest
     * Monitoring and reporting RPC success/failure
     * Proper error handling and decision routing
5) Use Write tool to create `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/daemon_pool_connector.json` with the complete agent configuration

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Agent must handle missing or invalid pool configuration files
- Agent must detect authentication failures gracefully
- Agent must verify network mismatch (e.g., mainnet vs regtest)
- Agent must handle daemon being unreachable/offline
- Agent must properly route to appropriate decision points based on outcomes
- Instructions should be clear enough for Claude to execute without ambiguity

EVIDENCE:
- Will read and reference section 2.2 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to ensure alignment
- Will examine existing agent JSON structure to ensure format compatibility
- Will create complete daemon_pool_connector.json with all required fields
- The agent JSON will include specific bash commands and validation checks
- Will verify the file is written to the correct path

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a straightforward task of reading documentation, understanding the agent JSON schema from examples, and creating a new agent configuration file that follows the established pattern with the specific requirements for daemon-pool RPC connection validation.
