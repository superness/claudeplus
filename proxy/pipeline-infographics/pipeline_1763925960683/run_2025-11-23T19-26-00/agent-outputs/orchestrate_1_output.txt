## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Assessment:**

### Components Status:
1. **Dependencies**: ✓ INSTALLED
   - bitcoind: Found at /home/super/bin/bitcoind
   - Mono runtime: Installed at /usr/bin/mono
   - cpuminer: Installed at /home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer
   - minerd: Installed at /home/super/.local/bin/minerd
   - CoiniumServ.exe: Present at /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/

2. **Configuration Files**: ✓ EXIST
   - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (RPC user: coiniumtest, port: 18443)
   - Pool main config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json
   - Pool instance config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json
   - Pool configured for: Stratum port 3333, daemon connection at 172.22.45.9:18443

3. **Bitcoin Daemon**: ✓ RUNNING & HEALTHY
   - Process running (PID 2499, 17353)
   - RPC accessible on port 18443 (verified with ss command)
   - Blockchain: 332 blocks in regtest mode
   - Wallet: "mining" wallet loaded with 6000 BTC balance
   - RPC credentials verified working (coiniumtest/testpass123)

4. **CoiniumServ Pool**: ✗ NOT RUNNING
   - No process found via tasklist.exe
   - Stratum port 3333 NOT listening (ss command shows no listener)
   - Previous logs show pool was running earlier (last activity 13:29, about ~36 minutes ago)
   - Log shows recurring "statistics recaching" errors but these appear non-fatal

5. **Miner Software**: ? NOT CONFIGURED/NOT RUNNING
   - Software installed but no configuration or running process detected

### Gaps Identified:
- **Primary Gap**: Pool server not running (all other components depend on pool being operational)
- **Secondary Gap**: Miner not configured or started
- **Validation Gap**: End-to-end communication not verified

### Dependency Analysis:
- Dependencies: ✓ Complete
- Configs: ✓ Complete  
- Daemon: ✓ Running and operational
- Pool: ✗ **NEEDS START** ← Current blocker
- Miner: ✗ Needs configuration (depends on pool)
- Validation: ⏳ Pending (depends on all components)

## Routing Decision

**DECISION: delegate_pool_setup**

**REASONING:**

The infrastructure analysis reveals a partial setup state:

1. **Foundation layers complete**:
   - All dependencies installed (bitcoind, Mono, cpuminer)
   - All configuration files present and properly structured
   - Bitcoin daemon fully operational (332 blocks, RPC working, wallet funded with 6000 BTC)

2. **Critical gap identified**: 
   - CoiniumServ pool server is NOT running despite configs being ready
   - Previous logs show pool ran successfully earlier but is currently stopped
   - Stratum port 3333 is not listening (verified via ss command)
   - Daemon RPC port 18443 IS listening and accessible

3. **Optimal next action**:
   - Skip dependency check (already verified installed)
   - Skip config generation (configs exist and appear valid)
   - Skip daemon setup (daemon running, responsive, and healthy)
   - **Start pool setup** - this is the immediate blocker preventing infrastructure completion

4. **Dependencies satisfied**:
   - Pool config references daemon at 172.22.45.9:18443 (matches daemon RPC bind)
   - Daemon credentials in pool config match actual daemon settings (coiniumtest/testpass123)
   - Daemon is operational and ready to serve getblocktemplate requests
   - CoiniumServ.exe binary exists and logs directory is present

5. **Subsequent path clear**:
   - Once pool operational → delegate_miner_setup
   - Once miner configured → delegate_validation
   - Once validation passes → infrastructure_complete

The pool server is the critical missing component blocking complete infrastructure setup. All prerequisites are met for pool startup.

DECISION: delegate_pool_setup
