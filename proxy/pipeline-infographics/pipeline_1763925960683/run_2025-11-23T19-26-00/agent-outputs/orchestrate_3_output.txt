## Infrastructure State Analysis Complete

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the current mining infrastructure. Here's what I found:

### Current State Summary:

**✓ DAEMON (Bitcoin Core) - OPERATIONAL**
- Status: Running (PID 2499)
- Network: Regtest mode
- Block height: 332 blocks
- RPC: Accessible on port 18443
- Wallet: Funded with 6000 BTC
- RPC credentials: Working correctly (coiniumtest/testpass123)
- getblocktemplate: **Working correctly** (verified via curl)

**⚠ POOL (CoiniumServ) - PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL**
- Status: Running (PID 17876)
- Stratum Port: 3333 bound to 0.0.0.0 (Windows side)
- Configuration: Valid daemon connection settings
- RPC to Daemon: **Working** (getblocktemplate successful)
- Issue: Stratum port **not accessible from WSL** (Windows/WSL networking issue)
- Secondary Issue: Recurring statistics error (non-critical)

**✗ MINER - NOT RUNNING**
- Binaries: Installed (cpuminer, minerd)
- Status: No active miner process
- Configuration: Needs setup

### Root Cause Identified:

The infrastructure is **mostly operational** but has a **critical networking issue**:
- Pool's Stratum server is listening on Windows (0.0.0.0:3333)
- Connection refused from WSL side (where miner will run)
- This is a Windows/WSL2 networking isolation issue

### Dependencies Status:
- ✓ Bitcoin Core installed and running
- ✓ Mono runtime operational (CoiniumServ running)  
- ✓ Mining software installed
- ✓ Configurations exist and are valid

## DECISION: delegate_validation

## REASONING:

Current infrastructure analysis reveals:

**Components Ready:**
1. Daemon: Running, RPC accessible, wallet funded, getblocktemplate working
2. Pool: Running, properly configured, **daemon RPC connection verified**
3. Miner: Binaries installed, needs configuration

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- Pool Stratum port (3333) shows LISTENING on Windows but refuses connections from WSL
- This is a Windows/WSL2 networking boundary issue

**Strategic Decision:**
Instead of immediately attempting to fix the Stratum networking issue, I'm delegating to the **validation agent** first because:

1. **Validation will perform comprehensive testing** - It will systematically test daemon, pool, and miner connectivity to identify ALL issues, not just the Stratum issue
2. **getblocktemplate is working** - Pool successfully communicates with daemon, which is the core mining flow
3. **Validation agent has diagnostic capabilities** - It can determine if the Stratum issue is fatal or if there's a workaround (direct Windows connection, port forwarding, etc.)
4. **Holistic assessment needed** - Before making fixes, we need to understand the complete picture of what works and what doesn't

The validation agent will:
- Test daemon RPC accessibility
- Verify pool-daemon communication (likely to pass)
- Test Stratum connectivity (likely to fail and provide diagnostic details)
- Identify any other integration issues
- Return a report that will inform the next targeted fix

This follows the principle: **Validate before fixing** to avoid solving the wrong problem.
