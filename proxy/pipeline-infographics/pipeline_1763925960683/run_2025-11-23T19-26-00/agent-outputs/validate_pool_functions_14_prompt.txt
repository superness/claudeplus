=== ROUTING DECISION REQUIRED ===
After your response, you MUST choose exactly ONE decision from:
- pool_functions_valid: All pool functions validated successfully
- pool_functions_invalid: Pool function validation failed, needs fixing

**CRITICAL**: Your VERY LAST LINE must be exactly:
DECISION: [ONE_OF_THE_ABOVE_CHOICES]
Example: DECISION: pool_functions_valid
Do NOT add explanations after the decision keyword.
