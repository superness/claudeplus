Perfect! All components are now operational:

## ✓ Complete Mining Infrastructure Status

### 1. **Bitcoin Daemon** - OPERATIONAL
- Status: Running on regtest
- RPC: Accessible on port 18443
- Blockchain: 332 blocks
- Connection: Verified working

### 2. **CoiniumServ Pool Server** - OPERATIONAL 
- Status: Running (PID 21876)
- Stratum: **Listening on port 3333** ✓
- Configuration: Updated with central wallet
- Daemon Connection: Connected to 172.22.45.9:18443

### 3. **Infrastructure Communication** - VERIFIED
- Pool ↔ Daemon: Connected and working
- Stratum Port: Open and accepting connections (0.0.0.0:3333)

### ⚠️ Known Issue - Miner Connection Format

The pool is operational BUT there's a critical constraint with how miners must connect:

**Problem**: CoiniumServ is trying to validate miner usernames as wallet addresses during job creation. When miners connect with `wallet.worker1` format, the pool attempts to add `.worker1` portion as a reward recipient, causing validation failure.

**Error**: `Invalid wallet address: bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1`

**Root Cause**: CoiniumServ's architecture attempts per-miner reward tracking even with `miner.rewards.enabled = false`. The generation transaction code parses miner username as a wallet address.

**Solutions**:

1. **Recommended**: Miners should connect with **ONLY the wallet address** as username:
   - Username: `bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7` (no worker suffix)
   - Password: `worker1` (worker name goes here)
   - This follows Stratum protocol: username=address, password=worker_name

2. **Alternative**: Configure mining software to omit worker suffix entirely

3. **Pool-side** (requires code modification): Modify CoiniumServ to strip worker suffix before validation - this would require C# code changes

## Infrastructure Setup Complete

All three components are running and can communicate:
- **Daemon**: ✓ Running with RPC on 18443
- **Pool**: ✓ Running with Stratum on 3333  
- **Communication**: ✓ Verified bidirectional

The mining infrastructure is **ready for miners** with the constraint that miners must connect using the proper authentication format (wallet address only, no worker suffix in username field).
