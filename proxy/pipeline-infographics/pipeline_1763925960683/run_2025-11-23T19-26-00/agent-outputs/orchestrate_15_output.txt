## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State Detected:**

✓ **Dependencies**: Installed
- bitcoind: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind`
- Mono runtime: `/usr/bin/mono`
- cpuminer: `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer`

✓ **Daemon**: Running and operational
- Process IDs: 2499, 32959
- RPC accessible on port 18443
- Block height: 332
- Chain: regtest
- Wallet funded and operational

✓ **Pool Process**: Running (PID 21876)
- CoiniumServ.exe process active
- Configuration files exist

✗ **Pool Stratum Port**: NOT accessible
- Port 3333 configured but connection refused
- Pool process running but Stratum service not listening

**Critical Issue Identified:**
Pool logs show **wallet address validation errors**:
```
Error: Invalid wallet address: bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1
```

The pool is running but failing to create mining jobs because:
1. Wallet address format issue (appending `.worker1` to address)
2. This prevents getblocktemplate job creation
3. Stratum port appears configured (bind 0.0.0.0:3333) but not accepting connections
4. Additional error: "The method or operation is not implemented" in statistics caching

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Pool has configuration/wallet address handling bug
- Jobs cannot be created → Stratum service likely not initializing properly
- This is a **pool function validation failure**, not a simple startup issue

**Infrastructure State Summary:**
- Daemon: ✓ Fully operational
- Pool: ⚠️ Process running but non-functional (wallet/job errors)
- Miner: ⚠️ Not yet configured (but cannot connect to broken pool)
- Validation: ✗ Cannot validate with broken pool

**Next Action Required:**
The pool is experiencing function validation failures (wallet address handling, job creation). This needs to be routed to the pool-specific error handler to diagnose and fix the wallet address validation and job creation issues.
