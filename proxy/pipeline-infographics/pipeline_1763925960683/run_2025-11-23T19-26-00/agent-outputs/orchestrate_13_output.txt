Perfect! Now I have a complete picture of the infrastructure state. Let me analyze:

## Infrastructure State Analysis:

**CURRENT STATE:**

1. **Dependencies:** ✓ INSTALLED
   - bitcoind: Running (2 processes, PIDs 2499, 30746)
   - CoiniumServ: Running (PID 21876)
   - cpuminer: Installed at /home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer

2. **Configurations:** ✓ EXIST
   - Daemon config: ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf ✓
   - Pool config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json ✓
   - Pool-specific config: default.json ✓

3. **Daemon Status:** ✓ RUNNING & HEALTHY
   - Process running (multiple instances detected - PIDs 2499, 30746)
   - RPC accessible on port 18443 ✓
   - Chain: regtest
   - Block height: 332 blocks
   - Wallet funded: 6000 BTC balance
   - No errors in operation

4. **Pool Status:** ✓ RUNNING (with issues)
   - Process running (PID 21876)
   - Stratum server listening on 0.0.0.0:3333 ✓
   - Stratum accepting connections ✓
   - **ISSUE DETECTED:** Job creation failing with "Invalid wallet address" error
   - Pool trying to use miner username as wallet: "bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1"
   - Pool configuration has wallet address but job manager is incorrectly parsing miner username

5. **Miner Status:** ✗ NOT CONFIGURED
   - Mining software installed (cpuminer) ✓
   - No mining directory or configuration exists ✗
   - No wallet address configured for miner ✗

**IDENTIFIED ISSUES:**

1. **Pool Job Manager Error:** Pool's job creation is failing because it's trying to use the miner's username (which includes ".worker1") as a wallet address. This is causing job creation to fail.

2. **Miner Not Configured:** Miner software exists but has no configuration to connect to the pool.

**GAPS TO FILL:**

1. Pool functionality validation needed - the wallet address parsing error needs investigation
2. Miner needs configuration to connect to pool
3. End-to-end validation required to ensure full mining cycle works

**DECISION RATIONALE:**

The infrastructure is **mostly operational** but has a **functional issue** in the pool's job manager. Before proceeding to miner setup, I need to validate whether the pool can actually create jobs properly. The error shows that when a miner connects with "bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7.worker1", the pool tries to parse this entire string as a wallet address instead of separating the address from the worker name.

This is a **pool function validation issue** - the pool is running but its core job creation functionality is failing. I should validate pool functionality first to either:
- Confirm the issue and route to pool error handler
- Or validate that it works and proceed to miner setup

Since there's a clear functional error in the pool logs, I should route to **validate_pool_function** to diagnose this issue before proceeding with miner configuration.

DECISION: validate_pool_function

REASONING:
Infrastructure assessment reveals three components with different states:
- Daemon: Running and healthy (block height 332, wallet funded with 6000 BTC, RPC accessible)
- Pool: Running but experiencing job creation failures (Stratum listening on 3333, but job manager throwing "Invalid wallet address" errors when parsing miner usernames)
- Miner: Installed but not configured

Critical issue detected: Pool's JobManager is failing to create jobs due to wallet address parsing error when miner connects with format "address.workername". This prevents miners from receiving work despite Stratum being accessible.

Before proceeding to miner configuration, pool functionality must be validated to ensure job creation works properly. If pool cannot create jobs, miner configuration is pointless as miners won't receive work.

DECISION: validate_pool_function
