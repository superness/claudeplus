## INFRASTRUCTURE STATE ANALYSIS

**Current State Assessment:**

### Dependencies: ✓ INSTALLED
- Bitcoin Core v25.0.0: `/home/super/bin/bitcoind`
- CoiniumServ: Running (PID 34968)
- CPUMiner: `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer`

### Configurations: ✓ EXISTS
- **Daemon Config**: `/home/super/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`
  - RPC user: `coiniumtest`
  - RPC password: `testpass123`
  - RPC port: 18443
  - Bind: `0.0.0.0` (accessible from WSL and Windows)
  
- **Pool Config**: `/mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json`
  - Daemon connection: `172.22.45.9:18443` (correct credentials)
  - Stratum port: 3333
  - Wallet: `bcrt1qpsrfamx3tnkhk5xyy3k0vyprlfcwfmls4j2nf7`

### Daemon Status: ✓ RUNNING
- Process: Running (PIDs 2499, 25793)
- RPC: **ACCESSIBLE** (tested successfully with correct credentials)
- Chain: Regtest
- Blocks: 332
- Wallet: Funded (mature blocks available)
- Port 18443: **LISTENING**

### Pool Status: ⚠️ RUNNING BUT ISSUES
- Process: Running (PID 34968, launched via cmd.exe wrapper)
- Stratum port 3333: **LISTENING** (confirmed via netstat.exe)
- Daemon connection: Using correct credentials (172.22.45.9:18443)
- **Issues Detected**:
  - Recurring statistics error: "The method or operation is not implemented" (non-critical)
  - Pool has restarted multiple times today (last at 14:42:11)

### Miner Status: ⚠️ NOT CONFIGURED
- Software: Installed at `/home/super/.local/bin/cpuminer`
- Configuration: **NOT SET UP** for current pool

### Identified Gaps:
1. ✓ Daemon fully operational
2. ⚠️ Pool running but needs validation (getblocktemplate connectivity)
3. ✗ Miner not configured to connect to pool

### Issues Requiring Attention:
1. Pool statistics implementation error (recurring, may impact monitoring)
2. Pool restart history suggests potential instability
3. Need to verify pool can successfully call getblocktemplate from daemon
4. Miner needs configuration with pool Stratum endpoint and wallet address

## ORCHESTRATION DECISION

**Analysis**: Infrastructure is partially operational with key components running:
- Daemon: Fully functional with RPC accessible
- Pool: Process running and Stratum listening, but needs functional validation
- Miner: Software available but not configured

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- Dependencies: ✓ All installed
- Configs: ✓ All present with correct settings
- Daemon: ✓ Running and RPC verified
- Pool: ⚠️ Running but needs functional validation

**Next Step**: Need to validate that the pool can successfully communicate with the daemon before proceeding to miner setup. The pool is running but we haven't confirmed that getblocktemplate and other critical RPC calls are working properly.

DECISION: delegate_validation

REASONING:
Current infrastructure state shows all components present with daemon fully operational and pool process running. However, before proceeding to miner configuration, need to validate end-to-end infrastructure functionality:
- Verify pool can successfully call getblocktemplate from daemon
- Confirm Stratum port is accessible for miner connections  
- Test daemon-pool integration is working despite pool statistics errors
- Identify any connectivity or functional issues before miner setup

Dependencies for validation are satisfied: daemon is running with RPC accessible (block height 332, wallet funded), pool is running with Stratum listening on port 3333, and configurations use matching credentials. Validation will confirm if pool statistics errors are affecting core mining functionality or are just monitoring issues.

DECISION: delegate_validation
