Now I have a complete picture of the infrastructure state. Let me create a comprehensive assessment:

## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current State:**

1. **Dependencies**: ✓ INSTALLED
   - bitcoind v25.0.0 installed and available
   - Mono runtime 6.8.0 installed
   - cpuminer 2.5.1 installed

2. **Bitcoin Daemon**: ✓ RUNNING (with minor issues)
   - Process running (PID 2499)
   - RPC accessible on port 18443
   - Regtest mode active
   - Block height: 332
   - Wallet funded (221 transactions)
   - **Issue**: Multiple "incorrect password attempts" in logs (from pool trying wrong credentials earlier)
   - **Issue**: RPC credentials in bitcoin.conf (coiniumtest/testpass123) working now

3. **Pool Configuration**: ✓ EXISTS
   - Main config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/config.json (incomplete - missing pools section)
   - Pool-specific config: /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/build/bin/Debug/config/pools/default.json (COMPLETE with correct RPC credentials)
   - Daemon connection configured: 172.22.45.9:18443 with coiniumtest/testpass123
   - Stratum port configured: 0.0.0.0:3333

4. **Pool Server**: ✗ NOT RUNNING (but was running recently)
   - Windows taskmanager shows CoiniumServ.exe (PID 17876) but this is a stale Windows process
   - NOT running in WSL Linux environment (no mono process found)
   - Last logs from 14:40:54 (stopped ~5 hours ago)
   - Logs show it successfully started: "Stratum server listening on 0.0.0.0:3333"
   - **Issue**: Pool has recurring error: "Error recaching statistics; The method or operation is not implemented"
   - Stratum port 3333 NOT currently listening (connection refused)

5. **Miner**: ✓ READY (but not configured/started)
   - cpuminer installed and working
   - No active miner process
   - Needs configuration with pool connection details

**Identified Gaps:**

1. Pool server is NOT actually running (Windows process is stale)
2. Pool has implementation errors (statistics caching not implemented)
3. Miner not configured or started
4. No end-to-end validation performed

**Decision Logic:**

Since:
- Dependencies are installed ✓
- Daemon is running and RPC working ✓
- Configurations exist ✓
- Pool is NOT running ✗ (highest priority gap)
- Pool depends on daemon (satisfied)
- Miner depends on pool (not satisfied yet)

The next logical step is to restart the pool server since it has stopped and there's a stale Windows process. The pool server needs to be restarted from WSL in the correct directory.

REASONING:
Current infrastructure state shows daemon running and healthy (block height 332, RPC accessible, wallet funded). Pool configurations exist with correct RPC credentials matching daemon setup. However, pool server is not actually running - the Windows tasklist shows a stale process from hours ago (last logs at 14:40), but no mono process exists in WSL and Stratum port 3333 is not accessible. Pool logs show it successfully started earlier and was listening on Stratum port, but also show recurring errors about unimplemented statistics caching (non-fatal, pool was still functioning). Dependencies are all installed (bitcoind, mono, cpuminer). Miner software is ready but not yet configured. The critical gap is the stopped pool server - it must be restarted before miner setup or validation can proceed. Since daemon is healthy and configs exist, delegating to pool setup to restart the pool server and establish daemon connection.

DECISION: delegate_pool_setup
