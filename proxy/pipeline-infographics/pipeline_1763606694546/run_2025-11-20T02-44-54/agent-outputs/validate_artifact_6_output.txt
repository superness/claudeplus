## Validation Results

I have thoroughly validated the **rpc_tester.json** agent file. Here are my findings:

### ✓ JSON Structure Validation
- **JSON Syntax:** Valid and well-formed
- **Required Fields:** All present (id, name, role, expertise, systemPrompt, permissions, decisions, outputFormat, validationCriteria)

### ✓ Requirements Compliance

**1. Test All Bitcoin RPC Endpoints** ✓
- Covers **45+ RPC methods** organized by priority
- Priority 1 (Critical Mining): getblocktemplate, submitblock, getmininginfo, getdifficulty, getwork
- Priority 2 (Block/Tx/Network): 15+ methods including getblock, gettransaction, getinfo
- Priority 3 (Wallet/Advanced): 20+ methods including validateaddress, createrawtransaction

**2. Validate Specific Methods** ✓
- getblocktemplate: Explicitly tested in mining workflow scenario
- submitblock: Explicitly tested with invalid block scenario
- getinfo: Tested in health check and performance benchmark
- All other critical methods covered

**3. Test Authentication and Authorization** ✓
- Valid credentials (200 OK)
- Invalid username (401)
- Invalid password (401)
- Missing credentials (401)
- Empty username/password
- HTTP Basic Auth validation

**4. Monitor RPC Performance** ✓
- **Latency metrics:** min, max, avg, median, P95, P99, standard deviation
- **Throughput metrics:** requests/sec, success rate, error rate
- **Performance thresholds:** EXCELLENT (<100ms), GOOD (<500ms), WARNING (<1000ms), POOR (>=1000ms)

**5. Detect RPC Errors and Timeouts** ✓
- JSON-RPC standard errors (-32700 to -32603)
- Bitcoin application errors (-1 to -27, all 24 error codes)
- Custom exceptions (RpcTimeoutException, RpcConnectionException)
- Connection failure detection

**6. Generate RPC Test Reports** ✓
- **JSON format:** Machine-readable with full metrics
- **Text format:** Human-readable with visual indicators
- Evidence collection (test logs, performance metrics, error analysis)
- Summary statistics and actionable recommendations

### ✓ Permissions Check
Required: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep  
**Actual:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep  
**Status:** ✓ Exact match

### ✓ Decisions Check
Required: rpc_tests_passed, rpc_tests_failed, error  
**Actual:** 
- rpc_tests_passed: "All RPC tests passed successfully with good performance"
- rpc_tests_failed: "RPC tests failed or performance is unacceptable"
- error: "Critical error occurred during testing"  
**Status:** ✓ All required decisions present with clear descriptions

### ✓ System Prompt Quality
- **Comprehensive:** 300+ lines of detailed testing methodology
- **6 Test Scenarios:** Health check, mining workflow, transaction validation, error handling, authentication, performance benchmark
- **10 Implementation sections:** Configuration, connectivity, methods, errors, performance, scenarios, workflow, evidence, formats, best practices
- **Clear decision criteria:** Specific thresholds for pass/fail (>95% success, <500ms latency)
- **Actionable guidance:** Step-by-step implementation with code examples

### ✓ Validation Criteria
All 5 validation criteria are comprehensive and measurable:
1. Critical RPC methods tested
2. Authentication validated
3. Performance metrics collected
4. Error detection verified
5. Test report generated

### ✓ Additional Strengths
- Configuration integration from pool config file
- Dual report formats (JSON + text)
- Performance benchmarking (100+ requests)
- Error classification and analysis
- Best practices and recommendations included
- Test isolation and independence
- Connection pooling optimization

## Conclusion

The **rpc_tester agent** passes all validation checks:
- ✓ Valid JSON structure
- ✓ All requirements met comprehensively
- ✓ Correct permissions assigned
- ✓ All required decisions defined
- ✓ High-quality system prompt with detailed methodology
- ✓ Production-ready and follows best practices

DECISION: valid
