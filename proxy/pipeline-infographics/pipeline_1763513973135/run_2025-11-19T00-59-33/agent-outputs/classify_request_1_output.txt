I'll analyze this request to classify it correctly.

**Analysis:**

Looking at the user's request, I can identify several key indicators:

1. **Title starts with "BUG REPORT"** - explicitly labeled as a bug
2. **Core issue**: "UI tracker is not updating" - something that should work doesn't
3. **Expected vs Actual behavior clearly defined**:
   - Expected: Objectives should show ✅ when complete
   - Actual: Objectives show ⬜ even when complete
4. **System is broken**: The mission tracker HTML is generated but "isn't responding to game events"
5. **Root cause identified**: PlayerProgressionManager tracks data correctly, but UI isn't reading/updating
6. **Keywords present**: "not updating", "not responding", "Fix"

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** request because:
- A feature exists but is malfunctioning
- Expected behavior is well-defined (tracking completion)
- The underlying data system works (PlayerProgressionManager)
- The UI layer has a defect (not reading/updating)
- User explicitly requests a "fix"

**Classification Output:**

```json
{
  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "Request explicitly labeled as 'BUG REPORT'. The Active Mission UI tracker exists but has a defect - it's not updating when objectives are completed. The underlying data tracking works correctly (PlayerProgressionManager), but the UI layer fails to read and display this data.

DECISION: BUG_FIX
