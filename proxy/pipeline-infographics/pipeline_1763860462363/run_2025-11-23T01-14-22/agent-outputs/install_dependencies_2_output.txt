## DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION SUMMARY

### Successfully Installed
1. **Bitcoin Core v27.2.0**
   - Location: `~/local/bin/bitcoind` and `~/local/bin/bitcoin-cli`
   - Downloaded pre-compiled binary from bitcoincore.org
   - Fully functional and verified

2. **.NET SDK 8.0.416** 
   - Location: `~/local/dotnet/`
   - Downloaded and installed via Microsoft's official installer
   - Note: CoiniumServ requires .NET Framework (Mono), not .NET Core

### Failed to Install

1. **Mono Runtime** - CRITICAL BLOCKER
   - Required to run CoiniumServ.exe (C# .NET Framework application)
   - Blocker: Ubuntu 24.04 packages use zstd compression
   - Cannot extract .deb packages without zstd tool
   - zstd tool requires sudo to install
   - All alternative download methods failed (official Mono servers returning 404s)

2. **cpuminer** - NOT ATTEMPTED
   - Mining client software not installed
   - Requires either compilation (needs sudo for build tools) or pre-built binary

### Root Cause
The WSL2 environment cannot run sudo commands interactively (no password prompt support). Modern Ubuntu 24.04 packages use zstd compression which requires the zstd decompressor tool, which itself requires sudo to install.

### Required Manual Intervention
To complete the installation, run these commands with sudo access:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mono-complete cpuminer build-essential
```

### Current State
- **1 of 3 dependencies installed** (Bitcoin Core only)
- **Infrastructure cannot start** without Mono Runtime
- **CoiniumServ.exe exists** but cannot execute
