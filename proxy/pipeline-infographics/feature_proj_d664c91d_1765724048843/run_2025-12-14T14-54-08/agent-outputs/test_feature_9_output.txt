The property names match:
- `characterData.character_id` - main.ts line 60
- `characterData.faction_code` - main.ts lines 68, 73
- `characterData.class_code` - main.ts line 69
- `characterData.character_name` - main.ts lines 70, 73

And from CharacterCreation.ts:
- `character_name` - line 1726
- `faction_code` - line 1727
- `class_code` - line 1728

The fix ensures that in all 4 code paths (response.ok, else/HTTP-error, catch/network-error, no-network), `onComplete` is called with `characterData` which contains these required fields. The integration path is complete.

## Test Results: Character Creation to Game Transition Flow

### Feature Being Tested
The fix ensures that when character creation API calls fail (HTTP errors like 401 Unauthorized or network errors), the game continues in offline mode by calling `onComplete(characterData)` instead of stopping. Previously, only network exceptions triggered offline mode; HTTP errors would show an alert and halt.

### Syntax Check
**PASS** - Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors.

### Integration Path
- **Entry point**: User completes character creation form and clicks submit → `submitCharacter()` in `CharacterCreation.ts:1724`
- **Chain**: 
  1. `submitCharacter()` creates `characterData` object with `character_name`, `faction_code`, `class_code`
  2. Attempts fetch to `/api/v1/characters`
  3. On success: calls `this.onComplete(result)` with server response
  4. On HTTP error (401, etc): calls `this.onComplete(characterData)` ✅ **FIXED**
  5. On network error: calls `this.onComplete(characterData)` (already worked)
  6. No network manager: calls `this.onComplete(characterData)` (already worked)
- **Target reached**: `onComplete` callback in `main.ts:56-87` receives character data
- **Downstream effect**: 
  1. Stores character ID (or generates temp ID for offline mode)
  2. Stores faction, class, name in localStorage
  3. Shows transition screen
  4. Disposes character creation
  5. Calls `initGame(networkManager)`
- **CONNECTED: YES**

### Issues Found
None - The fix properly handles all code paths:
1. Line 1763: Added `.catch(() => ({}))` to handle invalid JSON in error responses
2. Lines 1764-1768: Changed from alert-and-stop to console.warn and call `onComplete(characterData)`
