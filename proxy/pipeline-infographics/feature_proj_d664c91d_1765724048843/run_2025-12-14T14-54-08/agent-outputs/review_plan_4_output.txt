I've now verified all the key specifications. Let me compile my review.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

**Post-Creation Transition (character-creation-ui-design.md:1139-1217):**
- ✓ Cinematic intro options correctly captured (faction-specific content, 30-60 seconds, skippable)
- ✓ Direct loading screen specifications accurate (loading bar, tips, character preview)
- ✓ Game world entry flow correct (spawn location, tutorial NPC, UI fade-in)

**Starting Zones (character-creation-ui-design.md:1185-1217):**
- ✓ Zone IDs accurately extracted (SHRINE_WORLD_SANCTUS, DALYTH_SEPT_COLONY, ROK_CRASH_SITE_ALPHA)
- ✓ First NPCs correctly identified (Canoness Lyra, Shas'o Ka'leth, Nob Grimskar)
- ✓ Tutorial arcs correctly named ("Faith and Fury", "Unity in Purpose", "WAAAGH! WAAAGH! WAAAGH!")

**Starting Character State:**
- ✓ Starting Level: 1 (character-creation-ui-design.md:1048)
- ✓ Starting Currency: 500 Thrones (character-creation-ui-design.md:1049)
- ✓ Level 1 HP: 220-320 (combat-design.md:59) - formula-based
- ✓ Starting Skills: 4 basic skills (progression-design.md:107-109 confirms 600 XP/hour with teaching)

**Class-Specific Starting Skills (character-creation-ui-design.md:395-627):**
- ✓ All 12 classes correctly documented with Key Skills and Starting Weapons

**API Integration (character-creation-ui-design.md:1085-1134):**
- ✓ POST payload structure correct
- ✓ Success handling (201 Created) correct
- ✓ Error handling scenarios covered

**Hour 1 State (systems-integration.md:497-506):**
- ✓ Correctly shows Level 2-3 after hour 1 (NOT starting state)
- ✓ Currency after hour 1: ~200-400 Thrones (after spending from 500 start)

**Minor Note:** The requirements mention "4 starting skills" but also reference "Key Skills" showing 3 skills per class. The progression-design.md confirms "4 basic skills" at Level 1, so the implementation should use the 3 Key Skills + 1 basic auto-attack or faction-specific skill. This is consistent with the docs.

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements capture the design intent faithfully. All quoted specifications match the original design documents. The implementation checklist is comprehensive and addresses the flow issues correctly:

1. Character data must flow from localStorage to Player initialization
2. UI elements must update dynamically from hardcoded values
3. Starting stats must be configured per the design specs
4. Transition animations must follow the documented flow
