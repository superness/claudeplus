Now I have a comprehensive view of the codebase. Let me analyze the flow issues and identify the next feature to implement.

## Next Feature: Game Entry Flow (Post-Character Creation)

### Already Implemented

**Backend (src/):**
- Character creation API (`POST /api/v1/characters`)
- Character listing/retrieval (`GET /api/v1/characters`, `GET /api/v1/characters/:id`)
- Auth flow (login, logout, refresh tokens)
- Zone/World API (`GET /api/v1/zones`, `GET /api/v1/zones/:code/map`)
- Instance creation (`POST /api/v1/instances/create`)
- WebSocket combat handler (`ws://host/instances/:id`)
- Skill definitions and loadout API

**Client (client/src/):**
- Complete character creation flow (5 steps)
- Transition screen (shows "Entering [zone]" + progress bar)
- Game initialization with character data
- NetworkManager for API/WebSocket communication
- Combat system with skills, enemies, companions
- Local-only gameplay (demo enemies, proving grounds dummies)

### From Design Docs

From `api-specification.md`:
- Player should login → select character → enter zone → connect WebSocket for combat
- Missing explicit "enter world" or "character select" screen
- After character creation: `starting_zone` assigned (e.g., `SCHOLA_PROGENIUM`)

From `player-experience.md`:
- "Hub City Access" at ~90-105 minutes (Level 5)
- After character creation, player goes to starting zone
- Zone should have vendors, skill trainers, other players

### Why This Feature Next

The user explicitly stated **"flow issues getting into the game"** after character creation. Looking at the code:

1. **Character creation completes** → stores characterId in localStorage
2. **Transition screen shows** → faction-specific loading
3. **Game.init() runs** → spawns demo enemies and companions locally
4. **No authentication** → NetworkManager never authenticates
5. **No instance creation** → WebSocket never connects to an actual instance
6. **No zone loading** → game uses hardcoded demo content

**Core Problem:** The client operates entirely in "offline mode" after character creation. There's no:
- Login/authentication before character creation
- Character selection screen (for returning players with multiple characters)
- Zone data fetch from server (uses local demo content)
- WebSocket instance connection (combat is local-only)

This is a **Core Mechanic** issue per the prioritization framework - the player cannot actually enter the game world properly after creating a character.
