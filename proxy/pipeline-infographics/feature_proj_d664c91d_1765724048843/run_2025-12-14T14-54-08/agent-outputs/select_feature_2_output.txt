Now I have a clear picture of the codebase. Let me analyze the flow from character creation to the game and identify what exists vs what the issue might be.

## Next Feature: Post-Character-Creation Flow Integration

### Already Implemented
- **Character Creation System**: Complete 5-step flow (Faction → Class → Appearance → Name → Confirmation) in `CharacterCreation.ts`
- **Game Core**: Full 3D game with Player, World, Combat, Enemies, Companions, UI
- **UI System**: Skill bar, combat feedback, party UI, resource bars
- **Main Flow Logic**: `main.ts` has `shouldShowCharacterCreation()`, `initCharacterCreation()`, and `initGame()` functions
- **Transition Code**: `onComplete` callback that stores character data to localStorage and calls `initGame()`

### From Design Docs
From `systems-integration.md`:
- Level 1-5 is the "Tutorial Phase" (~3-5 hours)
- New characters start in faction-specific starting zones
- Player should have 3-4 skills available initially
- First hour teaches core systems (movement, skills, combat basics)

### Why This Feature Next
The user explicitly states "character creation just completed - there are flow issues getting into the game." This is a **core mechanic** issue - the most fundamental flow problem. Looking at the code:

1. **Character data not used**: After character creation completes, `localStorage` stores `selectedCharacterId`, `playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName` - but `Game.init()` and `Player` don't read these values to configure the character.

2. **UI not initialized with player data**: The UI hardcodes "Brother Titus", "Lv. 15 Crusader" in `index.html` and doesn't update based on created character.

3. **Player class not set from selection**: The `UI.setClass()` method exists but is never called with the player's chosen class after character creation.

4. **Game container visibility**: The transition hides/shows `uiOverlay` and `gameContainer` but timing may cause visual glitches.

This is blocking all new players from properly entering the game with their created character.
