Now I have a complete picture. Let me trace the integration paths for all the implemented features.

## Test Results: Character Creation to Game Entry Flow Fixes

### Feature Being Tested
The implement_client stage fixed four specific issues in the character creation to game entry transition:
1. Hardcoded UI placeholders → replaced with neutral loading states
2. Immediate UI updates on game init → added force refresh with actual player stats
3. Loading screen reset → progress bar resets to 0% before showing
4. Faction-specific companions → companions spawn based on player's chosen faction

### Syntax Check
**PASS** - Client builds successfully with no errors (only a chunk size warning which is expected).

### Integration Path

#### 1. Hardcoded UI Placeholders (index.html)
- Entry: `index.html` HTML structure
- Chain: Static HTML → Game init → UI.init() → updateResourceBars()
- Target reached: **YES**
- **Lines 41-52**: Character name shows "Loading...", level shows "Lv. 1", health/energy bars show "-- / --"
- **CONNECTED: YES**

#### 2. Immediate UI Updates on Game Init (UI.ts)
- Entry: `UI.init()` at line 90
- Chain: `Game.init()` (line 243) → `ui.init(player)` → `UI.init()` lines 145-154
- Target reached: **YES**
- **Lines 145-154**: Force calls `updateAll()` then `updateClassDisplay()` then `updateResourceBars(playerStats)` with actual player stats
- **CONNECTED: YES**

#### 3. Loading Screen Reset (main.ts)
- Entry: `initGame()` function at line 280
- Chain: Character creation completes → `initGame()` → reset progress bar
- Target reached: **YES**
- **Lines 294-305**: Shows loading screen, explicitly resets `loadingProgress.style.width = '0%'` and resets text
- **CONNECTED: YES**

#### 4. Faction-Specific Companions (Game.ts)
- Entry: `Game.spawnDemoCompanions()` at line 363
- Chain: `Game.init()` (line 285) → `spawnDemoCompanions()` → reads `this.characterData.faction` → selects faction companions
- Target reached: **YES**
- **Lines 367-385**: `factionCompanions` map defines IMPERIAL/TAU/ORK companions, line 385 selects based on `this.characterData.faction`
- **CONNECTED: YES**

### Data Flow Verification

The character data flows correctly:
1. CharacterCreation → localStorage (main.ts lines 68-70): stores `playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName`
2. localStorage → `loadCharacterData()` (main.ts lines 266-275): retrieves data
3. `loadCharacterData()` → Game constructor (main.ts line 349): passes `characterData`
4. Game constructor (Game.ts lines 87-92): stores in `this.characterData`
5. `Game.init()` → `UI.setCharacterInfo()` (Game.ts lines 246-249): passes to UI
6. `Game.init()` → `partyManager.setPlayerFaction()` (Game.ts line 264): sets faction for companions
7. `spawnDemoCompanions()` (Game.ts line 385): uses faction to select companions

### Issues Found
None - all four features are properly integrated and connected.
