## Manual Test: Character Creation to Game Flow

### What I Tested
Character creation wizard flow - testing the transition from character creation to the actual game after clicking "CREATE CHARACTER".

### How I Tested
Used Playwright to navigate through the complete character creation wizard:
1. **Faction**: Selected "Imperium of Man" 
2. **Class**: Selected "Battle Sister"
3. **Appearance**: Used defaults (Face Type 1, skin tone, hair style)
4. **Name**: Entered "TestMarine"
5. **Confirm**: Clicked "CREATE CHARACTER" button

### Results
- ✅ All 5 wizard steps work correctly
- ✅ Character preview renders in 3D
- ✅ Confirm screen shows correct summary (name, faction, class, role, starting zone)
- ❌ **CREATE CHARACTER fails with 401 Unauthorized**
- ❌ Game does NOT transition - stays on character creation screen

**Console Errors:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
[CharacterCreation] Server error: {error: Object}
```

**Root Cause:** In `CharacterCreation.ts:1762-1766`, when the server returns 401:
- Code shows an alert
- But **never calls `onComplete()`** to transition to the game
- The offline fallback in the catch block only handles network *exceptions*, not HTTP error responses

### Verdict
**Feature has flow issues** - Character creation wizard works perfectly but cannot transition to the game due to 401 authentication failure. The code needs to either require authentication before character creation, or fallback to offline mode when backend is unavailable/unauthenticated.
