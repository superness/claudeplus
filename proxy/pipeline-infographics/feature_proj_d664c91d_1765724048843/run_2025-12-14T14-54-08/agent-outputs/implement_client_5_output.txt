## Implemented

The character creation to game transition flow has been fixed with proper data flow and UI initialization.

## Design Compliance

- **Requirement**: Character data must flow from localStorage to Player initialization
  **Implementation**: Added `loadCharacterData()` function in main.ts that reads `playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName` from localStorage and passes them through `GameOptions.characterData` to the Game constructor.

- **Requirement**: Player starting stats for Level 1 (220-320 HP per design doc)
  **Implementation**: Added `CLASS_STARTING_STATS` in Player.ts with correct HP ranges per class (220-320 HP, 40-70 energy). Player now initializes at Level 1 with class-specific stats.

- **Requirement**: UI must display character name and level from character creation
  **Implementation**: Added `setCharacterInfo()` method to UI.ts that sets `playerCharacterName` and updates the display. The `updateClassDisplay()` method now shows the actual character name and current level.

- **Requirement**: Player faction color on 3D model
  **Implementation**: Added `FACTION_COLORS` constant with Imperial (red/gold), Tau (teal/cyan), Ork (green/red) colors. Player's `createPlaceholderModel()` now uses faction colors for body, shoulders, head, and adds a glowing accent detail.

- **Requirement**: SkillBar initialization with class-specific skills
  **Implementation**: Game.ts now calls `ui.setClass(characterData.classCode)` after initialization, which propagates to SkillBar to load the correct class skills.

- **Requirement**: PartyManager faction from character creation
  **Implementation**: Game.ts now sets `partyManager.setPlayerFaction(characterData.faction)` instead of hardcoded 'IMPERIAL'.

- **Requirement**: Transition animation from character creation (design doc: faction-specific loading screen)
  **Implementation**: Added `showTransitionToGame()` function with:
  - Faction-specific colors (#FFD700 Imperial, #00CED1 Tau, #00FF00 Ork)
  - Character name display with faction tagline
  - Starting zone name (Shrine World Sanctus, Dal'yth Sept Colony, Rok Crash Site Alpha)
  - First NPC name (Canoness Lyra, Shas'o Ka'leth, Nob Grimskar)
  - Animated progress bar
  - Gameplay tip

## Files Modified

- `client/src/main.ts` - Added character data loading, transition animation, faction-specific loading messages
- `client/src/game/Game.ts` - Added CharacterData interface, passes config to Player, sets UI character info and PartyManager faction
- `client/src/game/entities/Player.ts` - Added PlayerConfig interface, FACTION_COLORS, CLASS_STARTING_STATS, faction-specific model colors, Level 1 starting stats
- `client/src/ui/UI.ts` - Added setCharacterInfo method, character name/faction fields, updated class info to include all 12 classes

## How to Test

1. Clear localStorage to trigger character creation: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
2. Refresh the page - character creation should appear
3. Create a character by selecting:
   - Faction (Imperial/Tau/Ork)
   - Class (4 per faction)
   - Customize appearance
   - Enter name
   - Confirm
4. Verify the transition screen shows:
   - Character name in faction color
   - Faction tagline
   - Starting zone name
   - First NPC name
   - Progress bar animation
5. After transition, verify in game:
   - Character name displays in top-left UI
   - Level shows as "Lv. 1 [Class Name]"
   - HP/Energy bars show class-appropriate values (220-320 HP, 40-70 Energy)
   - Player model has correct faction colors
   - Skill bar shows correct class skills
   - PartyManager spawns faction-appropriate companions
