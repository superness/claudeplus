## Manual Test: Character Creation to Game Transition Flow

### What I Tested
The fix ensures that when character creation API calls fail (HTTP errors or network errors), the game continues in offline mode by calling `onComplete(characterData)` instead of stopping.

### How I Tested
1. Restarted the game server
2. Created a Playwright test that:
   - Cleared localStorage for fresh start
   - Selected IMPERIUM OF MAN faction
   - Selected BATTLE SISTER class
   - Progressed through appearance step
   - Entered character name "TestWarrior"
   - Clicked CREATE CHARACTER on confirm screen
   - Waited for game to load

### Results
- **Character Creation UI**: All 5 steps worked correctly (Faction → Class → Appearance → Name → Confirm)
- **Name validation**: Input accepted "TestWarrior" and enabled the Next button
- **Confirm screen**: Displayed all character details correctly (TestWarrior, Battle Sister, Imperium of Man, Hybrid role, Shrine World Sanctus starting zone)
- **Game transition**: Successfully loaded into the Training Area
- **Game state**: 
  - Character displayed as "TESTWARRIOR LV. 1 BATTLE SISTER"
  - Health (260/260) and Energy (50/50) bars visible
  - Party companions loaded (Enginseer Cog-7, Medic Jonas, Crusader Marcus)
  - Combat working (companions attacking dummies, damage numbers showing)
  - Test hooks available (`__TEST_HOOKS__` with 51 methods)

### Verdict
The character creation to game transition flow works correctly. The feature that handles offline mode fallback when API calls fail is properly integrated, and the normal flow (where API may return 401 due to no auth) correctly continues to the game in offline mode.
