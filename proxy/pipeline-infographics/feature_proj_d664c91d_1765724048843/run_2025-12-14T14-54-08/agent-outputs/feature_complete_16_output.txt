Now I have a comprehensive view of the codebase. Let me summarize the feature validation.

## Feature Complete: Character Creation & Combat System Integration

### What Was Built

This is a **backend API server** for a Warhammer 40K MMO with Guild Wars 1-style mechanics. The character creation system and combat integration have been implemented:

**Character Creation System:**
- Full character model with factions (Imperium, Chaos, Eldar, Ork, Tau, Tyranid, Necron)
- 20+ character classes mapped to appropriate factions
- Guild Wars 1-style attributes: Strength, Marksmanship, Toughness, Willpower, Leadership
- 8-slot skill bar + 1 elite slot (GW1 mechanics)
- Secondary class trial system (7-day trial before permanent commitment)
- Level cap 20 with attribute/skill point progression
- Starting zone assignment per faction

**Authentication Flow:**
- JWT-based auth with access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens
- WebSocket combat authentication via first message (secure, not URL params)
- Character ownership middleware
- Rate limiting middleware

**Combat System:**
- WebSocket-based real-time combat instances
- Skill execution with energy costs, cooldowns, and damage calculations
- 8 damage types with armor penetration
- Status effects/conditions system (buffs, debuffs, control)
- Target resolution (self, enemy, ally, party, AoE, cone, ground)
- Mission/instance linking with wave spawning support
- Companion (henchman/hero) integration

### Files Created/Modified

**Core Models:**
- `src/models/character.model.ts` - Character entity, factions, classes, attributes
- `src/models/combat.model.ts` - Combat instances, participants, skills
- `src/models/companion.model.ts` - GW1-style henchmen/heroes
- `src/models/mission.model.ts` - Mission instances with threat tiers

**Services:**
- `src/services/character.service.ts` - Character CRUD, ownership, leveling
- `src/services/combat.service.ts` - WebSocket combat, skill execution
- `src/services/auth.service.ts` - JWT authentication

**API Layer:**
- `src/api/character.api.ts` - REST endpoints for character management
- `src/api/auth.api.ts` - Registration, login, token refresh
- `src/api/combat.api.ts` - Combat REST endpoints
- `src/api/websocket/combat.handler.ts` - WebSocket handler
- `src/api/index.ts` - Express app setup with middleware

**Tests:**
- `src/tests/character.test.ts` - Character service unit tests
- `src/tests/auth.test.ts` - Authentication tests
- `src/tests/combat.test.ts` - Combat service tests

### Verified Working

The design compliance check **PASSED** - confirmed all combat systems are properly integrated:
- `Player.useSkill()` → `CombatManager.executeSkill()` → `CombatSystem.calculateDamage()` → `Enemy.takeDamage()` ✅
- 8 damage types implemented per design
- Threat tiers (MINORIS → APEX) with proper colors
- Faction aesthetics matching 40K lore

### Next Steps

The user mentioned **"flow issues getting into the game"** after character creation. This backend has:

✅ **Auth flow**: Register → Login → Get tokens  
✅ **Character flow**: Create → List → Get details  
✅ **Combat flow**: WebSocket auth → Join instance → Use skills  

**Missing/Potential Issues:**
1. **No world service endpoints exposed** - Character gets assigned a `currentZoneId` but there's no zone data API
2. **No explicit "enter game" endpoint** - After character selection, client needs to know where to go
3. **WebSocket combat requires instance ID** - How does a new character get their first instance?
4. **In-memory storage** - Character service uses `Map<>` not database (noted as "Replace with real DB")

**For a playable game flow, these backend pieces are needed:**
- Zone/world data API to load game world
- Instance creation when player enters zone
- Tutorial/starting mission flow

This is a **backend-only** project. The "flow issues" likely refer to:
1. Client doesn't know what API to call after creating character
2. No "enter world" or "start game" endpoint exists
3. WebSocket combat initialization unclear for new players

**DECISION: continue**
