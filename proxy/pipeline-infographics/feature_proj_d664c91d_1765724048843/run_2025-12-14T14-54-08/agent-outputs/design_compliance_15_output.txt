I now have complete visibility into the combat integration chain. Let me trace the full path and complete my compliance check.

## Design Compliance Check - Combat System Integration

### Integration Path Verification

**Traced the complete chain:**

1. **Player.useSkill()** (`Player.ts:395-407`) - Returns true indicating skill request was made
2. **InputManager** connects to **CombatManager** via `setCombatManager()` (`Game.ts:237`)
3. **CombatManager** is instantiated in **Game.ts:142**: `this.combatManager = new CombatManager(this.player, this.entityManager)`
4. **CombatManager.init()** is called with scene and camera (`Game.ts:234`)
5. **CombatManager.executeSkill()** validates and executes skills
6. **CombatManager.applyDamageToTarget()** calls `calculateDamage()` then `target.takeDamage()`
7. **Enemy.takeDamage()** (`Enemy.ts:1615-1641`) - Properly implements damage application with:
   - Dead check
   - Health reduction
   - Damage type tracking for death animations
   - Health bar visibility
   - Hit flash effect
   - Death trigger

### Key Integration Points Verified:

| Component | File:Line | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| CombatManager instantiated | Game.ts:142 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| CombatManager.init() called | Game.ts:234 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| PartyManager connected to Combat | Game.ts:271 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| Enemy attack callback wired | Game.ts:277-279 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| Combat feedback connected | Game.ts:427-500 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| Loot system wired to enemy death | Game.ts:736-755 | ✅ CONNECTED |
| Enemy.takeDamage() exists | Enemy.ts:1615-1641 | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Player.useSkill() exists | Player.ts:395-407 | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| CombatSystem.calculateDamage() | CombatSystem.ts:145+ | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

### Design Document Compliance:

- **8 Damage Types**: KINETIC, PIERCING, EXPLOSIVE, RENDING, THERMAL, ELECTRIC, WARP, PHOTON ✅
- **Armor Penetration System**: Per-damage-type values ✅
- **Status Effects**: MIGHT, VULNERABILITY, PROTECTION with stacking ✅
- **CC Immunity System**: Implemented ✅
- **Death Animations**: Damage-type specific (Enemy.ts:1383-1455) ✅
- **Threat Tiers**: MINORIS, MAJORIS, EXTREMIS, TERMINUS, APEX ✅
- **Health Bar Colors by Tier**: Implemented per design doc ✅
- **Faction Colors**: All 5 factions with proper 40K lore colors ✅

---

## COMPLIANCE CHECK RESULT: **PASSED**

All combat systems are properly **INTEGRATED**, not orphaned:
- `Player.useSkill()` → `CombatManager.executeSkill()` → `CombatSystem.calculateDamage()` → `Enemy.takeDamage()` ✅
- Companion AI connected via `PartyManager` ✅
- Loot generation connected to enemy death ✅
- Audio feedback connected to combat events ✅
- UI damage numbers connected to combat events ✅

The implementation matches the original design documents for visual combat, damage types, threat tiers, and faction aesthetics.
