## Current State

- **Client exists**: Yes - Full Vite + Three.js client in `client/` folder with character creation, combat system, and game UI
- **Design docs**: Extensive documentation including:
  - combat-design.md, progression-design.md, balance-analysis.md
  - henchmen-heroes-design.md, visual-combat-design.md
  - character-creation-ui-design.md (directly relevant)
  - api-specification.md, data-model.md
- **Backend code**: Full TypeScript/Express backend with:
  - Auth system (JWT tokens, refresh tokens)
  - Character service and API endpoints
  - Combat system (WebSocket based)
  - Economy, quests, companions, missions
  - PostgreSQL repositories
- **Can run**: Yes - Both backend (`npm run dev`) and client (`cd client && npm run dev`) have proper scripts

## Flow Analysis

The user mentions "character creation just completed - there are flow issues getting into the game". Looking at `main.ts`:

1. `shouldShowCharacterCreation()` checks `localStorage.getItem('selectedCharacterId')` 
2. After character creation completes, it stores `selectedCharacterId` and calls `initGame()`
3. The flow from character creation → game initialization appears to be in place

Potential flow issues could include:
- Transition timing between character creation cleanup and game init
- Loading screen visibility during transition
- Game UI (ui-overlay, game-container) display state management
- Authentication state not being properly initialized before game starts

## Recommendation

The client exists and is ready for feature work. The user specifically mentions flow issues after character creation, so we need to investigate and fix the transition from character creation to the game proper.
