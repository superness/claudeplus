Now I have enough information to complete the design compliance check. Let me provide my analysis.

## DESIGN COMPLIANCE CHECK REPORT

### 1. Character Creation Flow - 5 Step Wizard

| Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1: Faction Selection | ✅ MATCHES | 3 factions (Imperial, Tau, Ork) implemented with icons, lore, colors |
| Step 2: Class Selection | ✅ MATCHES | 4 classes per faction with roles (Tank/DPS/Healer/Hybrid) |
| Step 3: Appearance Customization | ✅ MATCHES | Face presets, skin tones, hair, scars, augments per faction |
| Step 4: Character Naming | ✅ MATCHES | 3-30 chars, validation regex, real-time feedback |
| Step 5: Confirmation | ✅ MATCHES | Summary panel, CREATE CHARACTER button |

### 2. UI Layout - 3-Column Structure

| Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 3-column layout (25%/50%/25%) | ✅ MATCHES | `cc-left-panel`, `cc-center-panel`, `cc-right-panel` |
| Step indicator (5 dots) | ✅ MATCHES | `cc-step-indicator` with icons and connectors |
| Back/Next navigation | ✅ MATCHES | `cc-btn-back`, `cc-btn-next` with keyboard support |

### 3. Visual Design

| Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Background: #0A0A0A | ✅ MATCHES | Per comment in CharacterCreation.ts:8 |
| Imperial: #FFD700 | ✅ MATCHES | Gold color used in faction cards |
| Tau: #00CED1 | ✅ MATCHES | Cyan color used |
| Ork: #00FF00 | ✅ MATCHES | Green color used |
| Typography: Cinzel headers | ✅ MATCHES | Per comment in CharacterCreation.ts:9 |

### 4. API Integration

| Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST /api/v1/characters | ✅ MATCHES | Line 1748 - `fetch('/api/v1/characters')` |
| Offline mode fallback | ✅ MATCHES | Lines 1762-1768 - calls onComplete with local data on error |
| Character data payload | ✅ MATCHES | Lines 1725-1741 - correct structure |

### 5. Transition to Game

| Design Requirement | Implementation Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Store character ID | ✅ MATCHES | main.ts:60-65 - localStorage.setItem |
| Store faction/class | ✅ MATCHES | main.ts:68-70 - stored for game init |
| Transition overlay | ✅ MATCHES | main.ts:140-261 - faction-specific with progress bar |
| Pass data to Game | ✅ MATCHES | main.ts:337-342 - characterData passed to Game constructor |

### 6. Combat Integration Chain

| Integration Point | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| CombatManager.executeSkill() | ✅ CONNECTED | Line ~210 - main entry point |
| → performSkillExecution() | ✅ CONNECTED | Line ~400 - calculates damage |
| → applyDamageToTarget() | ✅ CONNECTED | Line ~484 - applies to target |
| → target.takeDamage() | ✅ CONNECTED | Line 688 - `target.takeDamage(damageResult.finalDamage, ...)` |
| Enemy.takeDamage() | ✅ CONNECTED | Lines 1615-1641 - reduces health, triggers death |

### 7. Integration Test Verification

The previous pipeline stage confirmed:
- ✅ Character creation 5-step flow works
- ✅ Name validation accepts input
- ✅ Transition to game world works
- ✅ Game loads with character data (TESTWARRIOR LV. 1 BATTLE SISTER)
- ✅ Combat works (companions attacking dummies, damage numbers showing)

## DECISION: `matches_design`

**Rationale:**
1. All 5 character creation steps match the design document specifications
2. UI layout follows the 3-column Guild Wars 1-inspired design
3. Faction colors and theming match design requirements
4. API integration (POST /api/v1/characters) is implemented correctly
5. Offline fallback mode works (fixed in previous pipeline stage)
6. Combat integration chain is fully connected: `useSkill() → CombatManager → CombatSystem → Enemy.takeDamage()`
7. Character creation to game transition flow passes integration testing
8. Visual and mechanical elements align with Warhammer 40K aesthetic per design
