```
API INTEGRATION: POST /api/v1/characters

REQUEST PAYLOAD:
{
  "character_name": "Sister Mirael",
  "faction_code": "IMPERIAL",
  "class_code": "BATTLE_SISTER",
  "appearance": {
    "face_preset": 3,
    "skin_tone": 2,
    "hair_style": 5,
    "hair_color": "#8B4513",
    "scars": ["left_eye", "jaw"],
    "augments": ["bionic_eye_left"]
  }
}

SUCCESS (201 Created):
├── Store character_id in session
├── Play creation success sound (fanfare)
├── Fade out creation screen (1 second)
├── Transition: "Cinematic Intro" or "Game World"
```

#### Session Data Storage Requirements

From `player-experience.md:366-372` (Character Status):
```
├── Build preset displayed with context:
│   ├── "Your current build: [Build Name]"
│   ├── "This build excels at: [Solo content / Group healing / etc.]"
│   ├── "Key rotation: [Skill 1 → Skill 3 → Skill 5]"
```

This implies the game must store and display:
- Character name
- Faction
- Class
- Level
- Currency (Thrones)
- Equipped skills

### Implementation Checklist

#### Core Flow Issues to Fix
- [ ] Read character data from localStorage after character creation completes
- [ ] Initialize Player with correct faction, class, and name from creation data
- [ ] Update UI elements (nameplate, level display, class indicator) with created character data
- [ ] Set correct starting stats for Level 1 character (220-320 HP based on class)
- [ ] Initialize skill bar with 4 starting skills based on class
- [ ] Set starting currency to 500 Thrones

#### UI Updates Required
- [ ] Update `index.html` nameplate from hardcoded "Brother Titus" to dynamic name
- [ ] Update level display from hardcoded "Lv. 15 Crusader" to "Lv. 1 [Class]"
- [ ] Call `UI.setClass()` with the player's chosen class after character creation
- [ ] Ensure skill bar shows class-appropriate starter skills

#### Transition Flow
- [ ] Hide character creation UI container completely after creation
- [ ] Show game container with proper fade-in timing
- [ ] Initialize camera with "pull back from character spawn" animation
- [ ] Start zone ambient music appropriate to faction
- [ ] UI elements fade in (skill bar, health, minimap) - not instant

#### Starting State Configuration
- [ ] Set player level to 1
- [ ] Set player HP based on class (220-320 range)
- [ ] Set starting currency to 500 Thrones
- [ ] Equip T1 starting gear appropriate to class
- [ ] Unlock initial 4 skills based on class
- [ ] Set starting zone based on faction:
  - Imperial → SHRINE_WORLD_SANCTUS
  - Tau → DALYTH_SEPT_COLONY
  - Ork → ROK_CRASH_SITE_ALPHA
