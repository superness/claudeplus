## Implemented

Fixed multiple flow issues in the character creation to game entry transition:

1. **Hardcoded UI placeholders** - Replaced stale example values ("Brother Titus", "Lv. 15", "624 / 735") with neutral loading states
2. **Immediate UI updates on game init** - Added force refresh of resource bars with actual player stats
3. **Loading screen reset** - Progress bar now resets to 0% before showing when transitioning from character creation
4. **Faction-specific companions** - Demo companions now spawn based on the player's chosen faction (Imperial/Tau/Ork)

## Design Compliance

- Requirement: "Store faction/class for game init" (main.ts:68-70)
  Implementation: Data flows correctly from CharacterCreation → localStorage → loadCharacterData() → Game constructor

- Requirement: "Starting Level: 1" (character-creation-ui-design.md:1048)
  Implementation: index.html now shows "Lv. 1" instead of hardcoded "Lv. 15"

- Requirement: "Faction-specific content" (character-creation-ui-design.md:1139)
  Implementation: Companions now spawn based on faction - Imperial gets Jonas/Marcus/Cog, Tau gets Nira/Tash/Shan, Ork gets Stitchaz/Skullkrusha/Gutsmasha

- Requirement: "Loading bar, tips, character preview" (character-creation-ui-design.md:1169)
  Implementation: Loading screen properly resets progress bar to 0% before displaying

## How to Test

1. Clear localStorage (`localStorage.clear()` in browser console)
2. Navigate to the game URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
3. Complete character creation (select faction, class, appearance, name)
4. Verify the transition overlay shows correct faction content
5. Verify the game loads with:
   - Your chosen character name displayed
   - Correct class title (e.g., "Lv. 1 Battle Sister")
   - Health/energy bars showing Level 1 values (220-320 HP range per class)
   - Faction-appropriate companions in party
6. Test with each faction (Imperial, Tau, Ork) to verify different companions spawn
