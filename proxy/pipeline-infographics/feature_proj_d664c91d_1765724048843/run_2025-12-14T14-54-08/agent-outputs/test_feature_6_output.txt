Now I have a complete picture of the integration. The characterData uses `character_name`, `faction_code`, and `class_code` fields. Let me verify that main.ts correctly reads these in the callback (lines 56-74 in main.ts that we already read).

Looking at the code flow:

1. **Character Creation** → Calls `onComplete(characterData)` with fields: `character_name`, `faction_code`, `class_code`

2. **main.ts callback (line 56-87)**:
   - Stores to localStorage: `playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName`
   - Reads from `characterData.faction_code`, `characterData.class_code`, `characterData.character_name` ✓

3. **loadCharacterData()** (line 266-275):
   - Reads from localStorage
   - Returns `CharacterData` with fields: `characterId`, `faction`, `classCode`, `name` ✓

4. **Game constructor** (line 84-93):
   - Accepts `characterData` via `GameOptions.characterData`
   - Sets defaults if not provided ✓

5. **Game.init()** (line 246-264):
   - Calls `ui.setCharacterInfo(characterData.name, characterData.classCode, characterData.faction)` ✓
   - Calls `ui.setClass(characterData.classCode)` ✓
   - Calls `partyManager.setPlayerFaction(characterData.faction)` ✓

6. **Player constructor** (line 108-154):
   - Reads config to set `faction`, `classCode`, `characterName`
   - Loads class-specific starting stats from `CLASS_STARTING_STATS` ✓
   - Uses faction colors from `FACTION_COLORS` ✓

7. **UI.setCharacterInfo()** (line 222-233):
   - Sets `playerCharacterName` and calls `updateClassDisplay()` ✓

8. **UI.updateClassDisplay()** (line 238-252):
   - Uses `playerCharacterName` for character name ✓
   - Shows level and class title ✓

## Test Results: Character Creation to Game Transition Flow

### Feature Being Tested
Character data flow from character creation (faction, class, name) to game initialization including:
- Player stats initialization with class-specific values
- Faction colors on player model
- UI displaying character name and level
- SkillBar loading correct class skills
- PartyManager using correct faction

### Syntax Check
**PASS** - Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors

### Integration Path
- **Entry point**: CharacterCreation.submitCharacter() → onComplete(characterData)
- **Chain**: 
  1. main.ts callback stores to localStorage (playerFaction, playerClass, playerName)
  2. main.ts shows transition animation
  3. initGame() calls loadCharacterData() 
  4. Game constructor receives characterData
  5. Player constructor uses config for stats/colors
  6. Game.init() calls ui.setCharacterInfo(), ui.setClass(), partyManager.setPlayerFaction()
- **Target reached**: YES
- **CONNECTED: YES**

### Issues Found
None - All integration paths are properly connected:
- Character data fields match between CharacterCreation (character_name, faction_code, class_code) and main.ts callback
- localStorage keys match between storage (main.ts:68-70) and retrieval (loadCharacterData:267-270)  
- CharacterData interface fields match between main.ts and Game.ts
- PlayerConfig fields match between Game.ts (line 127-132) and Player.ts (line 31-36)
- CLASS_STARTING_STATS has entries for all 12 classes
- FACTION_COLORS has entries for all 3 factions (IMPERIAL, TAU, ORK)
- UI.setCharacterInfo properly stores and displays character name
