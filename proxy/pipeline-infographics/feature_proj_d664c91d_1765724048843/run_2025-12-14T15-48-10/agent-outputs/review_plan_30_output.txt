I now have the original design documents. Let me verify the extracted requirements against them.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

**Post-Creation Transition Flow (game-entry-flow-design.md Section IV.B & VIII.A)**:
- ✓ Cinematic intro option (30-60 seconds, faction-specific) accurately captured
- ✓ Direct loading option for alt characters correctly specified
- ✓ Loading screen design matches: faction-colored progress bar, minimum 3s display, 60s max timeout
- ✓ Character preview rotation and zone name display correct

**Game World Entry (game-entry-flow-design.md Section IV.A-B)**:
- ✓ Enter Game sequence (4 steps) accurately documented
- ✓ Spawn locations by faction (SHRINE_WORLD_SANCTUS, DALYTH_SEPT_COLONY, ROK_CRASH_SITE_ALPHA) correct
- ✓ Tutorial NPCs (Canoness Lyra, Shas'o Ka'leth, Nob Grimskar) correct
- ✓ UI progressive fade-in sequence (Health/Energy → Skill bar → Minimap → Full UI) matches docs

**Character Creation Completion (character-creation-ui-design.md Section VII.B)**:
- ✓ API call on "CREATE CHARACTER" click with loading spinner ("Forging your legend...")
- ✓ Success (201): Store character_id, play fanfare, fade out (1 second), transition to game
- ✓ Error handling for 400/500 responses documented

**Local Storage (game-entry-flow-design.md Section I.B)**:
- ✓ `last_selected_character_id` and `last_zone_id` storage specs captured

**Loading Screen Design (game-entry-flow-design.md Section IV.D)**:
- ✓ Full background with zone concept art, vignette effect
- ✓ Character model (200×300px, slow rotation)
- ✓ Progress bar (60% width, faction-colored gold/cyan/green)
- ✓ Tips rotation (every 5 seconds)
- ✓ Cancel button (bottom-right, Escape hotkey)
- ✓ Timing specs (3s min, 5-8s average, 60s max, 0.5s fade transition)

### Fidelity Check Passed
- All quoted sections match original documents exactly
- No invented requirements found
- No generic placeholders - specific values (3 seconds, 60 seconds, 200×300px, etc.) preserved
- Faction-specific mechanics accurately noted
- UI fade-in sequence order correct (Health/Energy first, then Skill bar, then Minimap, then Full UI)

### Ready for Implementation
The requirements capture the design intent comprehensively. The extracted checklist covers:
1. Character creation completion → localStorage storage
2. Transition overlay/loading screen with all specified design elements
3. Game container visibility management
4. Game initialization with character data
5. UI progressive fade-in sequence
6. Audio transitions
7. Loading screen hide with fade

The identified "Potential Flow Issues" section provides useful debugging targets for the actual client implementation.
