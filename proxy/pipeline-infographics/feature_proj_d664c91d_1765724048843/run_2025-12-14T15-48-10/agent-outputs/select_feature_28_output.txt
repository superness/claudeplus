Now I have a full picture of the flow. Let me analyze what I've found:

## Next Feature: Fix Character Creation → Game Transition Flow

### Already Implemented
Based on my code review:
1. **Character Creation UI** (`CharacterCreation.ts`): Complete 5-step flow (Faction → Class → Appearance → Name → Confirm)
2. **Main.ts Flow Logic**: 
   - `shouldShowCharacterCreation()` checks localStorage for `selectedCharacterId`
   - Character creation calls `onComplete` callback with character data
   - Character data is stored in localStorage (`playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName`, `selectedCharacterId`)
   - Transition overlay shows faction-specific loading screen
   - Game.ts receives `characterData` and uses it to configure player
3. **Game.ts Integration**: 
   - Accepts `CharacterData` in constructor options
   - Passes data to Player, UI, PartyManager, and CombatManager

### From Design Docs
The player experience doc describes:
- Character creation should take ~5 minutes (00:00-05:00)
- After confirmation, there's a cinematic transition with faction-specific messaging
- Player should enter "Shrine World Sanctus" (Imperial), "Dal'yth Sept Colony" (Tau), or "Rok Crash Site Alpha" (Ork)
- Tutorial begins immediately in the starting zone

### Why This Feature Next
The user explicitly stated there are **"flow issues getting into the game"** after character creation completes. This is a blocking issue that prevents testing the combat system and other features that were just implemented.

Potential flow issues I can see:
1. **Canvas visibility** - The game container and UI overlay are hidden during character creation but may not properly unhide
2. **Loading screen state** - Loading screen is shown twice (once initially, once after character creation) and may get stuck
3. **NetworkManager dependency** - Game initialization may be waiting for network connection that isn't established
4. **CSS/DOM conflicts** - Character creation CSS may interfere with game UI
