I have created a comprehensive design document for the Game Entry Flow. Here's a summary of what was designed:

## Design Document Created: `game-entry-flow-design.md`

### What This Document Addresses

The design fills the critical gaps identified between character creation and gameplay:

**1. Login Screen UI**
- Complete form specifications (email, password, remember me)
- Server status indicator
- Error handling for all authentication failures
- Auto-login flow for returning sessions

**2. Character Selection Screen**
- Visual character list with faction-colored portraits
- 3D character preview panel with details
- Last played character auto-selection
- Delete character flow with confirmation
- Integration with character creation

**3. Game Entry Flow**
- **New Characters**: Faction-specific cinematic intros (skippable)
- **Returning Characters**: Direct loading with position persistence
- **Returning Commander (14+ days)**: "What's Changed" summary, build reminders, refresh tutorial option, +25% XP buff

**4. Zone Connection Architecture**
- **Hub Cities**: Semi-persistent, player-sharded (100-200 players)
- **Open World**: Semi-persistent exploration zones
- **Dungeons/Raids**: Private instanced content via `POST /api/v1/instances/create`
- WebSocket protocols for all zone types

**5. Loading Screen Specifications**
- Zone-specific concept art backgrounds
- Faction-colored progress bars
- Rotating gameplay tips
- Character model preview

### Key Design Decisions

- **Guild Wars 1 Familiarity**: Clean, functional UI matching the referenced game
- **60-Second Return Time**: Returning players can be in-game within a minute
- **Seamless Transitions**: No jarring loads, smooth audio crossfades
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Network issues, token expiry, zone unavailability all addressed
- **Full Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, color blind modes, screen reader support
