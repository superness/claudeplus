### Implementation Checklist

Based on design docs, the transition from Character Creation → Game requires:

- [ ] **Character Creation Completion**
  - [ ] On successful API response (201), store `character_id` in localStorage (`selectedCharacterId`)
  - [ ] Store `playerFaction`, `playerClass`, `playerName` in localStorage
  - [ ] Play faction-appropriate success fanfare sound
  - [ ] Fade out character creation screen (1 second duration)

- [ ] **Transition Overlay / Loading Screen**
  - [ ] Display loading screen with faction-specific background
  - [ ] Show "Entering [Zone Name]..." text (zone by faction)
  - [ ] Faction-colored progress bar (gold/cyan/green)
  - [ ] Minimum display time: 3 seconds
  - [ ] Maximum timeout: 60 seconds with error/retry option

- [ ] **Game Container Visibility**
  - [ ] Unhide game canvas container after character creation
  - [ ] Unhide UI overlay after character creation
  - [ ] Hide character creation DOM elements

- [ ] **Game Initialization**
  - [ ] Pass character data to Game constructor (faction, class, name, characterId)
  - [ ] Player spawns at faction-specific starting zone
  - [ ] NetworkManager connection established (if applicable)

- [ ] **UI Progressive Fade-In (1 second total)**
  - [ ] First: Health bar, energy bar
  - [ ] Then: Skill bar
  - [ ] Then: Minimap
  - [ ] Last: Full UI complete

- [ ] **Audio Transition**
  - [ ] Stop character creation music
  - [ ] Start zone ambient music

- [ ] **Loading Screen Hide**
  - [ ] Remove/hide loading screen overlay
  - [ ] 0.5 second fade transition to game world

### Potential Flow Issues Identified

From the select_feature analysis, these are likely issues in current implementation:
1. Canvas visibility - game container and UI overlay hidden during character creation may not properly unhide
2. Loading screen state - may show twice or get stuck
3. NetworkManager dependency - may wait for connection that isn't established
4. CSS/DOM conflicts - character creation CSS may interfere with game UI
5. Event listener cleanup - character creation event listeners may not be properly removed
