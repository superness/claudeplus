## Manual Test: Game Entry Flow (Character Creation)

### What I Tested
The character creation and game entry flow that was just implemented, specifically:
1. Faction selection step
2. Class selection step  
3. Appearance step
4. Name entry with validation
5. Character confirmation
6. Entering the game world

### How I Tested
Used Playwright to:
1. Load the game client at localhost:3000
2. Select "IMPERIUM OF MAN" faction
3. Select "Battle Sister" class
4. Navigate through appearance step
5. Enter a valid character name following naming rules (letters, hyphens only, starts with capital)
6. Confirm character creation
7. Verify the game loads with the new character

### Results
- **Character creation screen loads correctly** - Shows "CREATE YOUR WARRIOR" with 5-step wizard (FACTION → CLASS → APPEARANCE → NAME → CONFIRM)
- **Faction selection works** - All three factions displayed (Imperium, Tau, Ork), clicking selects and enables NEXT
- **Class selection works** - Shows class options for selected faction with roles (HYBRID, DPS, TANK)
- **Appearance step works** - Navigates through successfully
- **Name validation works correctly** - Rejects invalid names (with numbers), shows naming rules, enables NEXT only when valid
- **Character creation completes** - Player enters game world at "TRAINING AREA" in "HIVE PRIMUS"
- **Game state correct** - Shows character (TestWarrior-Nbcd, LV 1 Battle Sister), health/energy bars, party members, skill bar, chat

**Minor observations:**
- 401 errors occur when client tries to validate name against server (expected in offline mode)
- Client gracefully handles offline mode and creates character locally

### Verdict
The character creation flow works correctly. All steps of the wizard function properly, validation is enforced, and the player successfully enters the game world after character creation.
