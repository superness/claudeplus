### Ready for Implementation

The extracted requirements are comprehensive and faithful to the original design documents. The extraction correctly identifies:

1. **The complete flow**: Character creation → Post-creation transition → Zone entry → Game world
2. **The integration point**: `character-creation-ui-design.md` Section VIII explicitly hands off to `game-entry-flow-design.md`
3. **New endpoint needed**: `POST /api/v1/zones/{zone_code}/enter` is documented but may not be implemented yet
4. **The "flow issues" context**: The user mentioned "flow issues getting into the game" after character creation, which aligns with the transition from character creation (Section VIII) to game entry (Section IV of game-entry-flow-design.md)

The requirements correctly capture the critical transition path:
- Character Creation Complete → Store character_id → Cinematic Intro OR Direct Loading → Zone Connection → WebSocket Auth → Game World Entry
