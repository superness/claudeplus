## Feature Complete: Character Creation System

### What Was Built
A comprehensive character creation system with the following components:
- **CharacterCreation class** (`src/game/CharacterCreation.ts`): Full UI for faction selection (Imperial, Tau, Ork), class selection (4 classes per faction), character naming, and backstory selection
- **Integration with Game**: Character data (faction, class, name, backstory) flows from creation screen into the main game
- **Visual Design**: Faction-appropriate colors, class descriptions with stats, responsive UI layout
- **Validation**: Name validation, duplicate name checking, proper state management

### Files Created/Modified
Based on the compliance check, the key files involved are:
- `src/game/CharacterCreation.ts` - Character creation UI and logic
- `src/game/Game.ts` - Main game receiving character data (lines 84-92, 246-250)
- `src/game/Player.ts` - Player entity configured from creation data (lines 108-115)
- `src/game/CombatManager.ts` - Loads class-appropriate skills (lines 148-177)

### Verified Working
The compliance check confirmed:
- Character creation data flows correctly to Game constructor
- Player receives config from character creation
- UI displays character info properly
- CombatManager loads class-appropriate skill loadouts
- Design document compliance score: 9/10

### Next Steps

The USER mentioned **"flow issues getting into the game"** after character creation. This indicates a problem with the transition from character creation to gameplay.

Based on the original request (40K Guild Wars 1 style game), the design docs show these core systems should be present:
1. ✅ Character Creation (just completed)
2. ✅ Combat System (verified working with full skill→damage flow)
3. ✅ Skill Bar (8 slots + 1 elite)
4. ✅ Enemy AI and damage
5. ⚠️ **Flow from Character Creation → Gameplay** (USER reports issues)

The USER explicitly stated there are "flow issues getting into the game" - this is the blocking problem that needs investigation and fixing before the game can be considered playable.

**Priority**: Debug and fix the character creation → game transition flow to ensure players can successfully enter gameplay after creating a character.
