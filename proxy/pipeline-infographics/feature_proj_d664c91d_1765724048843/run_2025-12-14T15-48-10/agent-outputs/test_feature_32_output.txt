All systems are working. Let me write up the test results.

## Test Results: Game Entry Flow After Character Creation

### Feature Being Tested
The game entry flow improvements after character creation, including:
1. Name availability check endpoint (`GET /api/v1/characters/check-name`)
2. Character creation API with client field mapping
3. Character selection endpoint (`POST /api/v1/characters/:characterId/select`)
4. Server status endpoint (`GET /api/v1/status`)
5. Client-side loading screen with cinematic transition
6. Progressive UI fade-in
7. localStorage persistence for character/zone data

### Syntax Check
- **Server TypeScript**: PASS (compiles without errors)
- **Client TypeScript/Vite**: PASS (builds successfully, 45 modules transformed)

### Integration Path

**Server-Side Flow:**
- Entry point: REST API endpoints at `/api/v1/*`
- Chain: `character.api.ts` → `characterService` → repository layer
- Endpoints verified:
  - `GET /api/v1/status` → Returns `{status: "ONLINE", version, serverTime}` ✓
  - `GET /api/v1/characters/check-name` → Requires auth, validates name ✓
  - `POST /api/v1/characters` → Accepts both client/server field names ✓
  - `POST /api/v1/characters/:id/select` → Returns character data for game entry ✓
- **CONNECTED: YES**

**Client-Side Flow:**
- Entry point: `main.ts:init()` → `shouldShowCharacterCreation()`
- Chain for new character:
  1. `initCharacterCreation()` → `CharacterCreation.init()`
  2. `submitCharacter()` → `POST /api/v1/characters` → `onComplete()`
  3. `onComplete()` → stores to localStorage → `showTransitionToGame()`
  4. Cinematic intro (skippable with Space/Click)
  5. `initGameWithLoadingScreen()` → `showGameLoadingScreen()`
  6. Loading screen with faction tips (5s rotation), cancel button (Escape)
  7. Game initialization with progress updates
  8. `hideGameLoadingScreen()` (min 3s display, 0.5s fade)
  9. `progressiveUIFadeIn()` → Health/Energy → Skillbar → Minimap → Full UI
- **CONNECTED: YES**

### Issues Found
None affecting this feature's integration.

### Summary
- Both server and client compile cleanly
- Server status endpoint responds correctly
- Character API accepts client field names (`character_name`, `faction_code`, `class_code`)
- Client loading screen implementation follows design doc specs (200×300px preview, 60% width progress bar, faction colors, 5s tip rotation, Escape cancel, min 3s display)
- Cinematic transition is skippable (Space/Click)
- Progressive UI fade-in follows correct order
- localStorage stores `last_selected_character_id` and `last_zone_id`
- Integration path from character creation to game is fully connected
