## Implemented

The game entry flow has been fixed according to the design document specifications. Here's what was built:

## Design Compliance

- **Requirement**: Loading screen with character preview (200×300px), zone art, faction-colored progress bar (60% width)
  - **Implementation**: Created `showGameLoadingScreen()` function with proper character preview box (200×300px), faction-specific colors, vignette effect, and 60% width progress bar per Section IV.D

- **Requirement**: Tips rotation every 5 seconds
  - **Implementation**: Added faction-specific tips array with `setInterval` rotation every 5000ms with fade transition per Section IV.D

- **Requirement**: Cancel button (bottom-right, Escape hotkey)
  - **Implementation**: Added "Cancel (Esc)" button positioned bottom-right with keyboard listener for Escape key per Section IV.D

- **Requirement**: Minimum 3s display, 0.5s fade transition
  - **Implementation**: `hideGameLoadingScreen()` enforces `MIN_DISPLAY_TIME = 3000` and uses 0.5s opacity transition per Section IV.D

- **Requirement**: Cinematic intro (30-60s, skippable) for new characters
  - **Implementation**: Created `showTransitionToGame()` with faction symbol, tagline, progress bar, and "Press Space or Click to skip" per Section IV.B Option A

- **Requirement**: Progressive UI fade-in (Health/Energy → Skill bar → Minimap → Full UI)
  - **Implementation**: `progressiveUIFadeIn()` fades in UI elements in exact order with 300ms delays per Section IV.B

- **Requirement**: Store `last_selected_character_id` and `last_zone_id` in localStorage
  - **Implementation**: Added storage of both values during character creation completion per Section I.B

- **Requirement**: Update zone name in minimap
  - **Implementation**: `updateZoneName()` sets correct faction-specific zone (Shrine World Sanctus / Dal'yth Sept Colony / Rok Crash Site Alpha)

## Files Modified

- `/mnt/c/github/40kgw/output/client/src/main.ts` - Major updates:
  - Added `LoadingScreenState` interface
  - Added faction-specific tips arrays
  - Added `showGameLoadingScreen()` function with full CSS styling
  - Added `updateLoadingProgress()` function
  - Added `hideGameLoadingScreen()` function with minimum display time
  - Updated `showTransitionToGame()` as cinematic intro
  - Added `updateZoneName()` function
  - Added `progressiveUIFadeIn()` function
  - Added `initGameWithLoadingScreen()` function
  - Updated character creation completion handler to store `last_selected_character_id` and `last_zone_id`
  - Updated `initGame()` to use new loading screen flow

## How to Test

1. Clear localStorage (`localStorage.clear()` in browser console)
2. Navigate to the client URL with `?create=true` to start character creation
3. Complete character creation - should see:
   - Cinematic intro with faction symbol, character name, tagline (skippable with Space/Click)
   - Loading screen with 200×300px character preview, faction tips rotating every 5s
   - Cancel button in bottom-right (Escape works)
   - Progress bar at 60% width with faction color
4. After loading completes (minimum 3s), UI should fade in progressively:
   - First: Health/Energy bars
   - Then: Skill bar
   - Then: Minimap (with correct zone name)
   - Finally: Chat, party frames, controls hint
5. Check localStorage for `last_selected_character_id` and `last_zone_id`
6. Refresh page - should load directly into game with loading screen (returning player flow)
