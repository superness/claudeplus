Now I have all the information needed. Let me compile the requirements extraction.

## Feature: Game Entry Flow (Post-Character Creation)

### Design Documentation Status: PARTIAL - GAPS IDENTIFIED

The design docs specify what happens AFTER character creation transitions to the game world, but there's a **critical gap**: No explicit specification for a **Character Selection Screen** or the complete authentication-to-game entry flow for returning players.

### What IS Designed
1. **Character Creation → Transition → Game World** (complete flow)
2. **Authentication API** (login, refresh, logout)
3. **Character List API** (GET /api/v1/characters)
4. **Instance Creation API** (for dungeons/combat zones)
5. **WebSocket Combat Connection** (for instances)
6. **Starting Zones** (per faction with spawn points)
7. **Returning Commander System** (for lapsed players)

### What is NOT Designed (Gap)
1. **Character Selection Screen UI** - No spec for returning players to choose which character to play
2. **"Enter Game" / "Play" Button Flow** - No spec for what happens when player selects a character
3. **Open World Zone Connection** - Instances are for dungeons; how does player enter starting zone/hub city?
4. **Login Screen UI** - No UI spec (only API spec exists)
5. **WebSocket for Open World** - Only dungeon instances are specified

---

### Implementation Checklist (Based on Existing Specs)

#### From API Specification:
- [ ] POST /api/v1/auth/login implementation verified
- [ ] GET /api/v1/characters returns character list with thumbnails
- [ ] POST /api/v1/instances/create for zone instances
- [ ] WebSocket connection at /instances/{instanceId}
- [ ] Token authentication for WebSocket (query param or first message)

#### From Character Creation UI Design:
- [ ] After character creation: store character_id
- [ ] Show transition screen (faction-specific loading)
- [ ] Duration: 3-10 seconds for loading
- [ ] Spawn at faction-specific starting zone
- [ ] Starting zones: SHRINE_WORLD_SANCTUS / DALYTH_SEPT_COLONY / ROK_CRASH_SITE_ALPHA
- [ ] Tutorial NPC nearby with glowing marker
- [ ] Auto-accept "First Contact" tutorial quest
- [ ] UI fades in (skill bar, health, minimap)

#### From Player Experience:
- [ ] Returning Commander system triggers at 14+ days absence
- [ ] "What's Changed" summary modal
- [ ] Character status reminder with build context
- [ ] Optional refresh tutorial
- [ ] +25% XP buff for 4 hours
- [ ] First 3 deaths: no repair cost

---

### What Needs to Be Designed (Client-Side Gaps)

```
1. LOGIN SCREEN
   - Email/password input fields
   - Register link
   - Error handling UI

2. CHARACTER SELECTION SCREEN
   - Display character list from GET /api/v1/characters
   - Character cards showing: name, level, class, faction, zone, last played
   - "Create New Character" button (if available_slots > 0)
   - "Play" / "Enter World" button per character
   - Delete character option

3. OPEN WORLD ZONE ENTRY
   - How does player enter hub city / starting zone (non-instance)?
   - Is it a shared instance? Sharded? Persistent?
   - WebSocket connection for open world or REST-based updates?

4. GAME SESSION FLOW
   Login → Character Select → Zone Loading → Game World
```
