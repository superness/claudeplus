## Feature Complete: Game Entry Flow Fix

### What Was Built
The game entry flow has been fully implemented and verified. The complete pipeline from login through character creation to actual gameplay is now connected and functional:

1. **Login Screen** - Email/password authentication with guest mode fallback, server status indicator, faction-neutral gold styling
2. **Character Creation** - 5-step wizard (Faction → Class → Appearance → Name → Confirm), 3D character preview, all 12 classes across 3 factions
3. **Game Transition** - Cinematic faction-specific transition, loading screen with progress bar and tips, progressive UI fade-in
4. **Game Initialization** - Player spawns with correct faction/class data, skill bar populated, companions spawn and fight, enemies active

### Files Created/Modified
Based on the compliance check, the core files involved:
- `src/client/main.ts` - Entry point orchestrating flow between screens
- `src/client/ui/LoginScreen.ts` - Authentication UI with server status polling
- `src/client/ui/CharacterCreation.ts` - 5-step wizard with 3D preview
- `src/client/ui/CharacterCreationData.ts` - Faction/class/appearance data
- `src/client/core/Game.ts` - Main game loop initialization
- `src/client/combat/CombatManager.ts` - Combat system integration

### Verified Working
The compliance check confirmed:
- Login → Character creation transition works (guest mode active)
- All 5 character creation steps functional
- Character data persists to localStorage and flows to game
- Game fully initializes with player, skills, companions, and enemies
- Combat systems active (companions fighting training dummies)
- Design doc compliance score: 9/10

### Next Steps
Comparing against the user's original request for a "40k Guild Wars 1 style game":

**What's Complete:**
- ✓ Authentication/login system
- ✓ Character creation with 3 factions, 12 classes
- ✓ Game entry flow (the issue they reported)
- ✓ Basic combat system with skills
- ✓ Companion system
- ✓ UI framework (health bars, skill bars, minimap)

**What Appears to be Core but Status Unknown:**
- Skill bar functionality (8 slots + 1 elite - GW1 signature feature)
- Secondary profession system (GW1 signature feature)
- Quest/mission system
- Zone navigation / world map
- Inventory/equipment system
- PvE enemy encounters beyond training dummies
- Network/multiplayer integration with backend

The user specifically said "character creation just completed - there are flow issues getting into the game" and the compliance check shows those flow issues are now resolved. The game successfully loads with a playable character after creation.

However, for a "Guild Wars 1 style" game, the skill system (8+1 skill bar, skill deck building, secondary profession) is the defining mechanic. I should verify if that's implemented before marking complete.
