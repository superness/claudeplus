Now I have enough context to complete the compliance check. Let me verify the integration test results mentioned in the input, which confirmed the flow is working. Based on my analysis of the design documents and the actual implementation:

## Compliance Check: PASSED

### Integration Verification

**Game Entry Flow Integration - VERIFIED CONNECTED:**
1. `main.ts:init()` → checks `isAuthenticated()` → routes to `initLoginScreen()` OR `initCharacterCreation()` OR `initGame()` ✓
2. `LoginScreen.ts` → `transitionToCharacterSelect()` → triggers `getGameStateManager().setState()` → main.ts listener triggers `initCharacterCreation()` ✓
3. `CharacterCreation.ts:submitCharacter()` → calls `onComplete` callback → `main.ts` stores character data → calls `showTransitionToGame()` → calls `initGameWithLoadingScreen()` ✓
4. `initGameWithLoadingScreen()` → creates `new Game()` → calls `game.init()` → calls `game.start()` ✓

**Combat System Integration - VERIFIED CONNECTED:**
1. `Game.ts:142` creates `CombatManager(this.player, this.entityManager)` ✓
2. `Game.ts:234` calls `combatManager.init(this.scene, this.camera)` ✓
3. `Game.ts:237` calls `inputManager.setCombatManager(this.combatManager)` ✓
4. `CombatManager.executeSkill()` → `performSkillExecution()` → `applyDamageToTarget()` → `target.takeDamage()` ✓
5. `CombatManager.executeCompanionSkill()` → `applyCompanionDamageToTarget()` → `target.takeDamage()` ✓

**Character Data Flow - VERIFIED:**
1. Character creation stores: `localStorage.setItem('playerFaction')`, `localStorage.setItem('playerClass')`, `localStorage.setItem('playerName')` ✓
2. Game.ts reads: `loadCharacterData()` returns `{ characterId, faction, classCode, name }` ✓
3. Player initialized with: `new Player(this.scene, playerConfig)` where `playerConfig` contains character data ✓
4. UI updated with: `ui.setCharacterInfo(name, classCode, faction)` and `ui.setClass(classCode)` ✓

### Verified Elements (Design Doc Compliance)

- ✓ Step indicator showing progress (CharacterCreation.ts:328-352)
- ✓ API integration: POST /api/v1/characters (CharacterCreation.ts:1746-1777)

**Game Entry Flow (game-entry-flow-design.md Section IV):**
- ✓ Cinematic transition with faction-specific messaging (main.ts:544-702)
- ✓ Loading screen with progress bar, tips rotation every 5s (main.ts:217-481)
- ✓ Minimum 3 second display time (main.ts:509-510)
- ✓ Cancel button and Escape key support (main.ts:454-470)
- ✓ Progressive UI fade-in: Health → Skill bar → Minimap → Full UI (main.ts:735-789)
- ✓ Faction-specific starting zone names (main.ts:145-195)

**Combat Integration (combat-design.md):**
- ✓ CombatManager connects Player → EntityManager → Enemy (CombatManager.ts:95-99)
- ✓ Skill execution: validateSkillUse() → performSkillExecution() → applyDamageToTarget() (CombatManager.ts:210-361)
- ✓ Damage calculation using design doc formula (CombatSystem.ts)
- ✓ Status effects with stacks (MIGHT, VULNERABILITY, PROTECTION) (CombatManager.ts:643-691)
- ✓ Companion AI skills wired to combat system (CombatManager.ts:972-1154)
- ✓ Enemy attacks damage player/companions (CombatManager.ts:1330-1402)

### Previous Test Results (from integration_test input)
The integration test confirmed:
- Login screen → Character creation works (guest mode)
- Faction/class/appearance selection works
- Name validation works (capital letter required)
- Character creation → Game loading works (with offline fallback)
- Game fully initializes with player, skills, companions, and enemies
- Combat systems active (companions actively fighting training dummies)

### Design Fidelity Score: 9/10

Minor notes:
- 401 errors on API calls in guest mode (expected, gracefully handled with offline fallback)
- Some visual polish items from design doc not fully implemented (e.g., full 3D character models use procedural geometry instead of detailed models)
- Audio system initialized but some faction-specific music tracks may be placeholder
