Based on my exploration, I now have a clear picture of what's implemented and what the next priority feature should be.

## Next Feature: Skill Bar Interaction & Build System

### Already Implemented
From code exploration:
- **Login Screen** - Full authentication flow with guest mode
- **Character Creation** - 5-step wizard with faction/class selection (3 factions × 4 classes = 12 total)
- **Game Entry Flow** - Cinematic transitions, loading screens, progressive UI fade-in
- **Skill Bar UI** (`SkillBar.ts`) - 8+1 slot visual display with cooldown overlays, lock indicators
- **Skills Definitions** (`Skills.ts`) - 40+ skills defined across 4 classes with damage/cooldown/energy data
- **Skill Tree System** (`SkillTree.ts`) - 4-tier progression with training costs defined
- **Secondary Profession UI** (`SecondaryProfession.ts`) - Trial system, commitment modal
- **Skills Panel** (`SkillsPanel.ts`) - Tree visualization, build management UI
- **Combat System** - Damage calculations, status effects, 8 damage types
- **Party/Companion System** - 3 companions spawn based on faction, AI fights enemies
- **Proving Grounds** - Training dummies for safe skill testing

### From Design Docs
From `progression-design.md`:
- **"The Weight of Choice" Tutorial** (Level 3): Critical GW1 philosophy teaching quest where player must select 4 skills from their pool to complete a challenge - teaches "build > power"
- **Build Advisors**: NPCs that suggest builds for Solo/Group/PvP/Nightmare content
- **Skill Bar Progressive Unlocking**: Levels 1-5 = 4 slots, Level 10 = full 8 slots + elite
- **Build Preset System**: Save/load builds, includes notes field for returning players

### Why This Feature Next
1. **Core mechanic gap**: The skill bar UI exists but isn't connected to actual skill usage - players can see their skills but may not be able to properly equip/swap skills from the skills panel
2. **GW1 defining feature**: The 8+1 skill bar with deck-building is THE signature mechanic - it's more important than quest systems or zones
3. **Build philosophy not taught**: The design doc's "The Weight of Choice" tutorial is flagged as CRITICAL - this teaches players why builds matter (addresses "Players don't understand GW1 philosophy" issue)
4. **Dependency for other features**: Secondary profession, skill tree spending, and build advisors all depend on a working skill equip system

The game has combat working with companions attacking dummies, but without skill bar interaction and build creation, players can't experience the GW1-style build crafting that makes the game unique.
