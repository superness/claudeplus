## Fixes Applied for: Game Entry Flow After Character Creation

### Issue 1: Client-Server Token Field Naming Mismatch (Login)
- **Related to feature**: YES - This is blocking login functionality which is essential for game entry flow
- **File**: `client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts:142-156`
- **Fix**: Changed client to expect camelCase field names (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`) to match server response format instead of snake_case (`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_in`)

### Issue 2: Client-Server Token Field Naming Mismatch (Refresh Token)
- **Related to feature**: YES - Refresh token flow is part of authentication which is needed for game entry
- **File**: `client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts:187-202`
- **Fix**: 
  1. Changed request body to send `refreshToken` (camelCase) instead of `refresh_token` (snake_case) to match server expectation
  2. Changed response parsing to read `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn` (camelCase) instead of snake_case

### Issues Skipped (Not Related to Current Feature)
- **401 Unauthorized Errors** - These are expected when not logged in; the login flow fix above should resolve them once users can properly authenticate
- **Registration API Broken (database schema mismatch)** - This is a pre-existing issue with the registration flow, not the character creation → game entry flow. The current flow works with existing accounts.
- **Character Creation Without Authentication** - The previous stages noted that a login gate was added and is working (`init()` → `isAuthenticated()` check → `initLoginScreen()`). The 401 errors seen were because tokens weren't being parsed correctly due to the naming mismatch.

### Verification
- **Client build**: PASS
- **Server build**: PASS
- **No syntax errors introduced**
