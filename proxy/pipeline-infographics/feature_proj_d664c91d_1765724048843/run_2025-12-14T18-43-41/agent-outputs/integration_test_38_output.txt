## Manual Test: Token Field Naming Fix (camelCase)

### What I Tested
The client-server token field naming alignment for login and refresh token flows. The previous implementation was reported to have snake_case vs camelCase field mismatches.

### How I Tested
1. Started the server with compiled code (`node dist/src/index.js`)
2. Tested registration endpoint - returns camelCase fields
3. Tested login endpoint - returns camelCase fields: `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`, `account`
4. Tested refresh token endpoint - returns camelCase fields: `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`
5. Ran Playwright to verify the client UI loads and shows login form with server status ONLINE
6. Verified the client code (`NetworkManager.ts`) expects camelCase fields which matches server responses

### Results

**Registration Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "QOw...",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  ...
}
```

**Login Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "OcN...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "account": {...}
}
```

**Refresh Token Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "YPi...",
  "expiresIn": 900
}
```

All responses use **camelCase** field names which matches what the client expects in `NetworkManager.ts`.

**Client UI:** Login screen renders correctly with server status showing "ONLINE".

### Additional Finding
There's a pre-existing data model inconsistency with factions/classes (the `CLASS_FACTION_MAP` uses different values than the `Faction` and `CharacterClass` enums), but this is **unrelated** to the token field naming fix being tested.

### Verdict
The token field naming fix is working correctly. The server returns camelCase fields (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn`) and the client expects these exact field names. Login and token refresh flows work as expected.
