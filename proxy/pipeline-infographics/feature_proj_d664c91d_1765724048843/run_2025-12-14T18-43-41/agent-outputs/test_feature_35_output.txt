The flow looks correct. However, I found a critical issue - the client/server token field naming mismatch. Let me verify this is blocking the flow.

## Test Results: Game Entry Flow After Character Creation

### Feature Being Tested
The fixes for the game entry flow after character creation:
1. Login gate - showing login screen when not authenticated
2. Registration API - fixing database schema mismatch in AccountRepository
3. New server endpoints - `/status`, `/check-name`, `/select`

### Syntax Check
- **Server build**: PASS (compiled without errors)
- **Client build**: PASS (compiled without errors)

### Integration Path

**Feature 1: Login Gate**
- Entry point: `init()` in main.ts:1003
- Chain: `init()` → `isAuthenticated()` check → `initLoginScreen(networkManager)`
- Target reached: YES - LoginScreen is initialized and shown when not authenticated
- **CONNECTED: YES**

**Feature 2: Server Status Endpoint**
- Entry point: `GET /api/v1/status`
- Chain: Client `checkServerStatus()` → fetch `/api/v1/status` → Server returns JSON
- Target reached: YES - Tested with curl, returns `{"status":"ONLINE","version":"1.0.0",...}`
- **CONNECTED: YES**

**Feature 3: Character Selection Endpoint**
- Entry point: `POST /api/v1/characters/:characterId/select`
- Chain: Client (future) → `selectCharacterHandler` → `characterService.verifyOwnership`
- Target reached: YES - Route is registered at line 595 of character.api.ts
- **CONNECTED: YES**

**Feature 4: Name Availability Check Endpoint**
- Entry point: `GET /api/v1/characters/check-name`
- Chain: Client (future) → `checkNameAvailabilityHandler` → `characterService.checkNameAvailability`
- Target reached: YES - Route is registered at line 586 of character.api.ts
- **CONNECTED: YES**

**Feature 5: Registration API Field Alignment**
- Entry point: `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- Chain: `registerHandler` → `authService.register` → `accountRepo.create`
- Target reached: PARTIAL - AccountRepository now uses correct column names
- **CONNECTED: YES** (repository code matches schema)

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL: Client-Server Token Field Naming Mismatch**
- Server returns: `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `expiresIn` (camelCase)
- Client expects: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_in` (snake_case)
- Location: 
  - Server: `src/api/auth.api.ts:138-143`
  - Client: `client/src/network/NetworkManager.ts:142-157`
- Impact: Login will fail because client cannot find tokens in response

This is a **blocking issue** for the game entry flow - users cannot log in due to the field naming mismatch.
