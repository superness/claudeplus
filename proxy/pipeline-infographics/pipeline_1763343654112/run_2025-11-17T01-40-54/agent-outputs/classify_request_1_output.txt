  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'CRITICAL BUG' and describes non-functional ship movement. Key indicators include: 'completely non-functional', 'does not respond', which are classic bug descriptions. The request asks to diagnose root cause and implement a fix to restore existing functionality, not add new features.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "CRITICAL BUG: Player ship movement is completely non-functional. The ship does not respond to navigation targets or tap-to-move commands. Diagnose the root cause by examining: 1) Touch/click input handlers for ship movement commands, 2) Navigation target setting logic, 3) Ship movement update loop and velocity calculations, 4) Event listeners and input routing. Once identified, implement a fix to restore full movement functionality and verify the ship responds properly to both navigation targets and tap-to-move commands.",
