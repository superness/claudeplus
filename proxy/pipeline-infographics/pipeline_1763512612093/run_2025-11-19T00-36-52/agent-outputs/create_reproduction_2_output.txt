Great! Now let me create a summary document explaining what the script does:

## Reproduction Script Created

I've created `test_active_mission_craft_equip_bug.js` - an automated reproduction script for the Active Mission tutorial bug.

### What the Script Tests

The script reproduces the bug where the "Craft and Equip Item to Your Ship" tutorial objective fails to complete even when the player:
1. ✅ Crafts an afterburner (increments `modules_crafted`)
2. ✅ Equips the afterburner to the ship (should increment `modules_fitted`)

### Test Sequence (13 Steps)

1. **Check initial player progression** - Verify "first_crafting" objective exists and is not completed
2. **Get mission state** - Confirm `modules_crafted` and `modules_fitted` counters are at 0
3. **Add resources** - Give player tritanium for crafting (cheat command)
4. **Start crafting** - Begin afterburner crafting job
5. **Complete crafting** - Force-complete the job immediately (test mode)
6. **Wait** - Allow event propagation (1 second)
7. **Check after crafting** - Verify `modules_crafted` was incremented
8. **Dock at station** - Required for fitting items
9. **Verify inventory** - Confirm afterburner is in inventory
10. **Fit afterburner** - Equip it to low slot 0
11. **Wait** - Allow event propagation (1 second)
12. **Verify fitted** - Confirm afterburner is in fitted slots
13. **Check mission completion** - **BUG CHECK**: Mission should be complete but is not

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:** After both crafting AND equipping an item, the `first_crafting` objective should complete (requires `modules_crafted: 1` AND `modules_fitted: 1`)

**Actual Bug:** Mission remains incomplete

### Root Cause Hypothesis

Based on the code analysis, the bug is likely:

1. **`recordModuleCrafted()` not called** - When `CraftingManager.completeJob()` finishes, it may not be calling `PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted()`

2. **`recordModuleFitted()` not called** - When `ShipFittingManager.fitItem()` completes, it may not be calling `PlayerProgressionManager.recordModuleFitted()`

3. **Event listener missing** - The integration between these systems may not have the proper event listeners to trigger the recording functions

### How to Run

```bash
node test_active_mission_craft_equip_bug.js
```

The script will:
- Launch Chrome with test mode enabled
- Execute all 13 test steps automatically
- Save evidence to `bug_evidence_[timestamp].json` with:
  - All command responses
  - Console logs from browser
  - Initial and final mission states
  - Detailed diagnostic information

### Evidence Collection

If the bug is reproduced, the evidence file will show:
- Initial mission state: `completed: false`, `modules_crafted: 0`, `modules_fitted: 0`
- After crafting: Whether `modules_crafted` was incremented
- After fitting: Whether `modules_fitted` was incremented
- Final state: `completed: false` (should be `true`)
