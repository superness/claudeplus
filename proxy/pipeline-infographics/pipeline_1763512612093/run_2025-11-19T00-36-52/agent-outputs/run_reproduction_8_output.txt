### Analysis

The reproduction test encountered a **framework error** that prevented complete execution:

**What happened:**
1. ✅ Test successfully started and connected to game
2. ✅ Retrieved initial player progression (level 1, phase: capsuleer_cadet)
3. ✅ Verified "first_crafting" objective exists and is not completed
4. ✅ Added crafting resources (tritanium, pyerite, mexallon, circuit_boards)
5. ✅ Started crafting job for afterburner (jobId: job_1)
6. ❌ **completeCraftingJob command failed** - Missing required parameter: jobId
7. ❌ Game disconnected before equip phase could be tested

**Root cause:**
The test script called `completeCraftingJob` without passing the `jobId` parameter, even though it successfully stored `jobId: "job_1"` from the startCraftingJob response (line 233 in evidence).

**Evidence quality:**
- Console logs captured: ✅ (5 entries, all Chrome GCM errors - not game-related)
- Test commands executed: ✅ (8 commands before failure)
- Evidence file generated: ✅ (bug_evidence_1763513307472.json)
- Console log file exists: ✅ (28,340 lines total)

**Test limitation:**
The test could NOT verify the actual bug because it failed at step 8 (force-complete crafting) before reaching the equip and final verification phases.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**

The reproduction script has a bug in the `completeCraftingJob` command invocation that needs to be fixed before the actual game bug can be tested.
