## Test Outcome Summary

The reproduction script **failed to reproduce the bug** due to a test infrastructure issue:

### Issue Encountered
- **Command Failed**: `startCraftingJob` with blueprint ID `afterburner_i`
- **Error**: "Blueprint not found: afterburner_i"
- **Root Cause**: The test script used an incorrect or non-existent blueprint ID

### What Was Verified
✅ Player progression system is active  
✅ "first_crafting" mission exists with correct structure  
✅ Mission requires both `modules_crafted: 1` AND `modules_fitted: 1`  
✅ Initial state shows `modules_crafted: 0` and `modules_fitted: 0`  
❌ Could not test crafting flow (blueprint not found)  
❌ Could not test fitting flow (couldn't craft item first)

### Evidence Collected
The evidence file shows:
- Initial mission state was correctly captured
- The mission objective structure is intact
- Console logs captured (GCM errors are unrelated to game functionality)
- Test stopped before the actual craft-and-equip sequence could execute

### Next Steps Required
The reproduction script needs to be updated with a **valid blueprint ID** that exists in the game's crafting system. Once corrected, the test can proceed to verify whether the mission completion detection works properly.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**
