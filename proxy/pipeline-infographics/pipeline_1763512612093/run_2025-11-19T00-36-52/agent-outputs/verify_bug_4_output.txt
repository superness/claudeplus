# BUG EXISTENCE VERIFICATION ANALYSIS

## EVIDENCE CHECKLIST EVALUATION

Let me verify the mandatory evidence requirements:

1. ✅ Evidence file exists: `bug_evidence_1763512883266.json`
2. ✅ Evidence file contains "commands" array: YES (4 commands executed)
3. ❌ Evidence file contains "bugReproduced": true OR "status": "BUG_REPRODUCED": NO - status is "COMMAND_FAILED"
4. ✅ Console log file path present: YES - `C:\\Users\\super\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ChromeTest_1763411549485\\chrome_debug.log`
5. ✅ Console logs array populated: YES (5 console log entries)
6. ❌ Test script was EXECUTED to completion: PARTIAL - stopped at step 4 due to blueprint error
7. ❌ Runtime state snapshots captured showing bug: NO - test stopped before bug reproduction sequence

```

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Test Execution Status
- **Commands Executed**: 4 of 7+ expected
- **Test Progress**: ~35% complete (stopped at crafting step)
- **Bug Reproduction**: NOT ATTEMPTED (prerequisite step failed)

### What Was Verified
✅ **Mission System Initialized**: Mission "first_crafting" exists  
✅ **Mission Structure Valid**: Requires `modules_crafted: 1` AND `modules_fitted: 1`  
✅ **Initial State Correct**: Both counters at 0  
✅ **Console Logs Captured**: 5 entries (all browser warnings, no game errors)

### What Was NOT Verified
❌ **Crafting Event Detection**: Test never crafted an item  
❌ **Fitting Event Detection**: Test never equipped an item  
❌ **Mission Completion Logic**: Test never triggered completion check  
❌ **Bug Reproduction**: Cannot confirm if mission fails to complete

### Why This Is INCONCLUSIVE

The test failed due to **test infrastructure error**, not because the bug was disproven:

1. **Invalid Blueprint ID**: Script used `afterburner_i` which doesn't exist in game
2. **Incomplete Test Sequence**: Never reached the craft/equip steps that would reproduce the bug
3. **No Negative Evidence**: Absence of bug reproduction ≠ Bug doesn't exist
4. **No Positive Evidence**: Test didn't complete successfully to prove bug exists

This is analogous to testing a car's braking system but never starting the engine - you can't confirm brakes work OR don't work if the car never moved.

### Console Log Analysis

The 5 console errors are **NOT related to the bug**:
- All errors are `GCM: the notification permission state is 'denied'`
- These are Chrome browser notification permission warnings
- No errors from game code (CraftingManager, ActiveMissionSystem, etc.)
- No JavaScript exceptions during test execution

### Test Infrastructure Issue

**Root Cause**: Blueprint ID mismatch
- Test script assumes `afterburner_i` exists
- Game's CraftingManager doesn't recognize this ID
- Need to verify actual blueprint IDs in `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/CraftingManager.js`

## VERIFICATION DECISION

Per the critical rule: **NO RUNTIME EVIDENCE = INCONCLUSIVE**

This test execution provides:
- ✅ Evidence file with partial execution data
- ✅ Console logs (but no game-related errors)
- ✅ WebSocket command responses
- ❌ **NO evidence of bug reproduction** (test never reached reproduction steps)
- ❌ **NO evidence of mission completion detection** (test stopped before completion check)

The test framework worked correctly, but the test script used invalid game data. This is a **test design issue**, not a bug verification.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE** (Test infrastructure error prevented bug reproduction - need valid blueprint ID to re-run complete test sequence)
