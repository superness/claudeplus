  "hypothesis": "The Active Mission system is likely not listening for the correct events from both the crafting and ship fitting systems, or the event listeners are not properly detecting when BOTH conditions (craft + equip) have been satisfied. Possible issues: (1) Missing event listeners for 'itemCrafted' or 'itemEquipped' events, (2) Mission completion logic only checks one condition instead of both, (3) Event data not properly passing item details to verify it's the same item that was crafted and equipped, (4) Race condition where events fire but mission tracking state is not updated"
