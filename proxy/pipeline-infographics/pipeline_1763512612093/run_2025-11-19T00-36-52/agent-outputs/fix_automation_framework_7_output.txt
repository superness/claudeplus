Perfect! Now the test framework is fixed. Let me create a summary document of the changes made:

## Framework Fixes Applied

I've corrected the reproduction test script to use the proper game data:

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Incorrect Blueprint ID**: Changed `afterburner_i` → `basic_afterburner_bp`
   - The ContentManager defines blueprints with `_bp` suffix
   - The correct blueprint is `basic_afterburner_bp` which creates the item `basic_afterburner`

2. **Incorrect Item ID**: Changed `afterburner_i` → `basic_afterburner`
   - The crafted output item is `basic_afterburner`, not `afterburner_i`

3. **Incorrect Slot Type**: Changed `low` → `mid`
   - According to ContentManager, basic_afterburner fits in a `mid` slot, not `low` slot

4. **Missing Crafting Materials**: Added all required materials for the blueprint:
   - Tritanium: 1000 (was present)
   - Pyerite: 500 (added)
   - Mexallon: 100 (added)
   - Circuit boards: 2 (added)

### Changes Summary:
- Line 110: Blueprint ID corrected to `basic_afterburner_bp`
- Lines 107-138: Added all required crafting materials (pyerite, mexallon, circuit_boards)
- Line 187: Item ID check corrected to `basic_afterburner`
- Line 203: Fit command updated to use `basic_afterburner` in `mid` slot
- Line 229: Verification updated to check `mid` slots for `basic_afterburner`

The test framework is now properly configured to reproduce the bug with correct game data.
