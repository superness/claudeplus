ASSESSMENT: 

The plan demonstrates a solid understanding of the task requirements and follows a logical, methodical approach. The designer correctly identifies the need to:
- Examine existing agent JSON files to understand the schema
- Research the codebase for network architecture details
- Map all requirements to specific agent capabilities
- Validate JSON syntax and completeness

The step-by-step approach is well-structured, moving from discovery (finding existing agents) to analysis (understanding schema and network topology) to implementation (writing the complete agent JSON).

However, there are several concerning gaps:

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS 1: Vague Evidence Collection**
The EVIDENCE section lists what will be shown but doesn't specify HOW the designer will prove each requirement was implemented. For example:
- "Will show the complete network_monitor.json file structure" - but no mention of validating against requirements checklist
- "Will demonstrate how each requirement maps to agent capabilities" - too vague, no concrete validation method

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS 2: No Concrete Verification Plan**
The plan doesn't specify how to verify:
- That ALL six requirements are actually implemented (Monitor network connectivity, Track connection states, Detect network issues, Monitor port availability, Log network events, Alert on connectivity problems)
- That all four decision types are properly configured
- That the JSON actually works within the agent framework

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS 3: Missing Requirement Traceability**
No mention of creating a mapping/checklist that shows:
- Requirement 1 → Agent capability X
- Requirement 2 → Agent capability Y
etc.

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS 4: Test Considerations Are Not Evidence**
The TEST_CONSIDERATIONS section describes scenarios but doesn't explain how these will be validated in the final deliverable. Testing scenarios ≠ proof of implementation.

**POSITIVE ASPECTS:**
- Good recognition that schema must match existing patterns
- Appropriate tool usage (Glob, Read, Grep, Write)
- Reasonable confidence level with honest limitations
- Clear understanding that daemon↔pool and pool↔miner are the key connection paths

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence lacks specificity and concrete verification methods. The plan says what will be shown but not how completion will be proven. There's no commitment to:
- A requirements checklist showing each requirement is addressed
- Validation that all permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) are specified
- Proof that all decisions (network_healthy, network_issues, connection_lost, error) are configured
- JSON schema validation against existing working agents
- Line-by-line requirement mapping in the final agent

DECISION: **REJECTED**

**Specific Reasoning:**
This plan needs revision to include concrete verification steps. Before approval, the designer must specify:

1. **Requirement Verification Matrix**: Commit to creating a table/checklist showing each of the 6 requirements and exactly where in the agent JSON it's implemented

2. **Schema Validation**: Specify that the agent JSON will be compared field-by-field against a working reference agent to ensure compatibility

3. **Decision Coverage**: Explicitly map each of the 4 decision outcomes to specific monitoring conditions in the agent prompt/configuration

4. **Concrete Evidence Format**: Instead of "will demonstrate how requirements map to capabilities", specify "will provide a numbered list showing requirement text → JSON field/section → validation that it addresses the requirement"

5. **Completeness Check**: Commit to a final verification that reads through the requirements list and confirms each one with a specific JSON excerpt

The plan is on the right track but needs these concrete verification commitments to ensure solid proof of completion. Without them, there's too much risk of missing requirements or producing an agent that doesn't fully meet specifications.

DECISION: REJECTED
