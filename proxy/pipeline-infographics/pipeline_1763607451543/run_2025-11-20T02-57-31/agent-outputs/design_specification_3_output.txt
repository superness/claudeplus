UNDERSTANDING: User wants a network monitoring agent created that monitors connectivity between cryptocurrency mining pool components (daemon, pool, miners), tracks connection states, detects network issues, monitors ports, logs events, and provides alerts. The agent must be written as a complete JSON configuration file.

APPROACH: 
1. Explore the existing agent structure in the codebase to understand the JSON schema
2. Examine similar monitoring agents to understand patterns and expected fields
3. Review the mining pool architecture to identify components and connection points
4. Design the agent with appropriate monitoring capabilities, decision points, and tool permissions
5. Create comprehensive monitoring logic covering all requirements (connectivity, latency, packet loss, port availability)
6. Write the complete agent JSON with proper structure

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find existing agent JSON files: `**/*.json` in `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/`
2) Read 2-3 existing agent files to understand the JSON schema structure
3) Use Grep to search for network-related monitoring code in the codebase: pattern `"network|connectivity|port|latency"` 
4) Use Grep to find daemon and pool connection handling: pattern `"daemon.*connection|pool.*connection|miner.*connection"`
5) Read relevant source files to understand component architecture and connection patterns
6) Design the network_monitor agent JSON structure including:
   - Agent metadata (name, description, version)
   - Permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
   - Decision points: ["network_healthy", "network_issues", "connection_lost", "error"]
   - Monitoring tasks configuration
   - Network check intervals and thresholds
   - Alert configuration
   - Logging specifications
7) Write the complete JSON to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/network_monitor.json`

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Agent should handle scenarios where daemon is unreachable
- Must detect pool server disconnections
- Should identify miner connection drops
- Must measure and report on latency spikes
- Should detect port blocking/unavailability
- Must handle partial network failures (some components up, others down)
- Should work with various network configurations
- Must properly log events without filling disk space
- Alert thresholds should be configurable

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the complete agent JSON structure showing all required fields
- Will demonstrate proper schema compliance by comparing with existing agents
- Will show how monitoring logic addresses each requirement (connectivity tracking, issue detection, port monitoring, logging, alerting)
- Will verify the decision points map to appropriate network states
- Will confirm permissions array matches requirements

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While I can examine existing agent structures and create a comprehensive JSON configuration, I need to verify the exact schema format used by this specific agent system. The mining pool architecture exploration will ensure the agent monitors the correct components and connection types. The main uncertainty is whether there are additional required fields or specific formatting conventions beyond standard JSON that the agent system expects.
