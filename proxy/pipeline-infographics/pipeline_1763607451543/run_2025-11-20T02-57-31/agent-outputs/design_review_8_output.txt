ASSESSMENT: This plan demonstrates a methodical approach to understanding the existing agent framework before creating the network_monitor agent. However, there are several critical weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
1. Logical progression: examining existing agents → understanding codebase → designing new agent
2. Appropriate use of tools (Glob, Read, Grep) for discovery
3. Specific search patterns for network components, daemon connections, and miner connections
4. Clear enumeration of the required decisions (network_healthy, network_issues, connection_lost, error)
5. Test considerations show understanding of different network states

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague Evidence Collection**: The plan lists "Grep results showing..." but doesn't specify what concrete information will be extracted or how it will be used
2. **Undefined Agent Schema**: The plan assumes an agent JSON structure exists but doesn't verify this assumption. What if the claudeplus/agents directory doesn't exist or uses a different format?
3. **Missing Validation Step**: No plan to validate the created JSON against the schema or test it
4. **Incomplete Monitoring Specification**: While it mentions "latency measurements" and "port availability," it doesn't specify HOW these will be implemented in JSON (are these custom scripts? Built-in checks? External tools?)
5. **No Concrete Success Criteria**: The evidence section doesn't specify what would prove the agent is correctly configured (e.g., "JSON validates against schema X" or "Contains monitoring checks for ports Y, Z")
6. **Medium-High Confidence Mismatch**: The confidence should be lower given the uncertainty about the agent framework structure

**Missing Critical Information:**
- What format do "checks" take in the agent JSON? (Scripts? API calls? Command executions?)
- How are "actions" defined and executed?
- What triggers are available in the framework?
- Is there a schema or documentation to validate against?

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is mostly descriptive ("Grep results showing...") rather than specific and verifiable. Strong evidence would include:
- "JSON file validates against agents/schema.json with zero errors"
- "Agent includes connectivity checks for ports [specific port numbers from config]"
- "Contains exactly 4 decision outcomes matching requirements"
- "Test run of agent produces expected monitoring output"

The current evidence doesn't provide concrete proof that the created agent will actually function correctly or meet all requirements.

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasons for Rejection:**
1. The plan needs to first verify the agent framework exists and understand its exact schema before proceeding
2. Evidence collection must specify concrete, measurable outcomes rather than vague "results"
3. Must include validation/testing step to prove the agent works
4. Should specify exact monitoring mechanisms (bash scripts, API endpoints, etc.) based on framework capabilities
5. Needs to address the assumption that `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/` is the correct location

The planner should revise to include framework discovery/validation as Step 1, make evidence requirements explicit and verifiable, and add a validation step at the end.

DECISION: REJECTED
