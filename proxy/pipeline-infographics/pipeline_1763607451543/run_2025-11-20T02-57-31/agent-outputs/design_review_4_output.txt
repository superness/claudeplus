ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
- The plan demonstrates clear understanding that this is about creating a cryptocurrency mining pool network monitoring agent
- Appropriately identifies the need to examine existing agent JSON files to understand the schema
- Correctly plans to research the mining pool architecture (daemon↔pool↔miner connections)
- Lists comprehensive test considerations covering various failure scenarios
- Acknowledges medium confidence level appropriately given uncertainty about exact schema

**Critical Weaknesses:**

1. **Vague Evidence Collection**: The plan states "Will provide the complete agent JSON structure" but doesn't specify HOW to verify it actually works. There's no mention of:
   - Validating the JSON syntax
   - Testing if the agent can be loaded by the system
   - Verifying the monitoring logic actually executes
   - Confirming the decision points trigger correctly

2. **Missing Concrete Verification Steps**: Step 7 just says "Write the complete JSON" with no follow-up validation. A strong plan would include:
   - JSON schema validation
   - Dry-run or syntax check
   - Comparison against a known-working agent structure
   - Verification that all required fields are present

3. **Uncertain Schema Knowledge**: The "Medium confidence" is concerning - the plan admits "I need to verify the exact schema format" but doesn't specify how this verification will be proven to the user. What if the schema is wrong?

4. **No Proof of Functionality**: Creating a JSON file is only half the task. The plan doesn't address:
   - How to prove the monitoring logic is correct
   - How to demonstrate the decision points will work
   - Whether the bash commands for network checks are valid
   - If the alert mechanisms are properly configured

5. **Incomplete Test Strategy**: While test considerations are listed, there's no plan to actually validate any of them or provide evidence the agent handles these scenarios.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence consists mainly of "will show" and "will demonstrate" statements without concrete artifacts:
- "Will provide the complete JSON" - This is just file creation, not proof it works
- "Will demonstrate proper schema compliance by comparing" - No specific comparison method or success criteria
- "Will show how monitoring logic addresses each requirement" - Too vague, no measurable criteria
- No mention of validation output, test results, or verification logs

Strong evidence would include:
- JSON validation output showing no errors
- Comparison diff showing the structure matches known-working agents
- Documentation of which existing agent was used as the template
- Verification that the file can be parsed by the target system
- Test output showing the monitoring logic responds to network events

DECISION: REJECTED

**Specific Reasoning:**
This plan will likely produce a JSON file, but provides insufficient proof that the file is correct, functional, or meets the system's requirements. The medium confidence level combined with vague verification steps means there's a significant risk of delivering a non-functional agent. The plan needs:

1. Explicit JSON validation step with expected output
2. A test/verification step proving the agent can be loaded
3. Clear success criteria for schema compliance
4. Concrete comparison against a known-working template agent
5. Higher confidence through more thorough research, or acknowledgment of what validation steps will compensate for uncertainty

The current plan reads more like "I'll create a file and hope it's right" rather than "I'll create a file and prove it's correct through these specific verification steps."

DECISION: REJECTED
