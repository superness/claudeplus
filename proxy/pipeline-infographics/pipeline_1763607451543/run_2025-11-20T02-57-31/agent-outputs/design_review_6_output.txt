ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. Clear understanding of requirements - network monitoring for mining pool components (daemon↔pool, pool↔miner)
2. Logical step-by-step approach starting with examining existing agent schemas
3. Appropriate tool selection (ping, netstat, ss, curl for network monitoring)
4. Comprehensive test considerations covering multiple failure scenarios
5. Recognizes need to examine existing agent patterns before implementation

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague evidence collection** - "Will examine existing agent JSON structures" doesn't specify WHAT will be verified or HOW compliance will be demonstrated
2. **No concrete validation steps** - The plan says "validate JSON schema" but doesn't specify how this validation will be performed or what constitutes valid
3. **Missing output specification** - What exactly will prove the agent file was created correctly? File existence? Content verification? Schema validation output?
4. **Incomplete confidence justification** - "Medium-High" confidence seems reasonable but the gap between examining existing patterns and writing a compliant agent is glossed over
5. **No verification method** - How will you prove the agent works as intended after writing the JSON? Just file creation isn't sufficient evidence

**Critical Gap:**
The plan lacks concrete, verifiable evidence collection. It should specify:
- Exact validation command/method for JSON syntax
- Specific schema fields that MUST be present (with examples from examined files)
- Method to verify the agent can actually be loaded by the framework
- Sample output showing what "success" looks like

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is too generic:
- "Examine existing agent JSON structures" - doesn't specify what will be documented as proof
- "Reference mining pool architecture" - vague, no specific files or patterns identified
- "Validate JSON syntax" - no validation method specified
- "Provide the complete agent specification" - this is the deliverable, not evidence of correctness

**Strong evidence would include:**
- Specific schema validation output (e.g., "JSON passes validation against schema X")
- Comparison table showing required fields from existing agents vs. new agent
- Test load output from the agent framework
- Specific file paths and line numbers referenced during research

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the plan shows good understanding and a reasonable approach, it fails to specify concrete, verifiable evidence that would prove task completion. The validation steps are vague ("will validate JSON") without specifying HOW validation occurs. The evidence section describes intentions rather than specific proof artifacts. A stronger plan would include explicit validation commands, specific schema compliance checks, and concrete success criteria beyond just "file was written."

**Required improvements:**
1. Specify exact JSON validation method (tool/command)
2. Define concrete success criteria with measurable outputs
3. Add verification step to test-load the agent after creation
4. Specify what documentation from examined agents will be captured as proof of schema compliance

DECISION: REJECTED
