ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
1. The plan demonstrates clear understanding that this is a network monitoring agent for cryptocurrency mining pool infrastructure (daemon↔pool↔miners)
2. Logical progression: examines existing agents → understands schema → designs monitoring logic → extracts configuration → implements agent JSON
3. Specific monitoring tasks identified: ping tests, port scanning (nc/netstat/ss), connection state tracking, latency/packet loss detection
4. Correctly identifies the need to extract ports/endpoints from CoiniumServ configuration files
5. Includes appropriate test scenarios for different network conditions
6. Good understanding of the four required decisions: network_healthy, network_issues, connection_lost, error

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Vague evidence specification**: "Will show the complete agent JSON structure" - this doesn't specify WHAT constitutes valid JSON or HOW to verify it works
2. **No verification methodology**: Missing concrete steps to verify the agent actually functions (e.g., "validate JSON syntax with jq", "test agent loads in framework", "simulate network failure and verify decision triggers")
3. **Unclear decision routing logic**: Doesn't specify exact conditions that trigger each decision (e.g., "connection_lost if TCP connect to RPC port fails 3 consecutive times", "network_issues if latency >100ms AND packet loss >5%")
4. **Configuration extraction uncertainty**: Step 4-5 assumes relevant ports exist in config files but doesn't handle case where they're missing or default values needed
5. **Missing success criteria**: No specific metrics defined (e.g., "agent must detect connection failure within 30 seconds", "false positive rate <1%")

**Critical Gaps:**
- No mention of validating the output JSON file format
- No specification of how to verify the agent integrates with the broader agent framework
- Threshold values mentioned (>100ms, >5% packet loss) but not justified or documented as requirements
- "Will document" and "Will show" are passive - doesn't commit to specific verifiable artifacts

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak**

The proposed evidence focuses on deliverables (JSON file, documentation) but lacks:
- Concrete validation steps (JSON schema validation, syntax checking)
- Functional verification (does the agent actually execute? do decisions route correctly?)
- Quantifiable success metrics (detection accuracy, false alarm rates, response time)
- Test execution results proving each scenario works

The evidence should include:
1. Valid JSON file at specified path (verifiable with `test -f` and `jq` validation)
2. Specific bash command outputs showing successful connectivity checks
3. Log files demonstrating each decision type triggered under controlled conditions
4. Configuration extraction showing exact ports/endpoints monitored

DECISION: REJECTED

**Reasoning:** While the plan shows good domain understanding and logical structure, it lacks the CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE evidence and validation steps required for high-confidence approval. The plan needs:
1. Specific JSON validation methodology (jq syntax check, schema validation)
2. Explicit decision criteria with exact thresholds and conditions
3. Functional testing protocol with expected outputs for each scenario
4. Clear success/failure criteria that can be objectively measured

The current plan may produce a JSON file, but doesn't adequately prove it will actually work or meet requirements.

DECISION: REJECTED
