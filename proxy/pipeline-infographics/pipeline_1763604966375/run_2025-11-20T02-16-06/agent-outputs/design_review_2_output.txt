ASSESSMENT:

The design specification demonstrates comprehensive understanding and planning. Let me evaluate each critical aspect:

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Understanding**: The plan correctly identifies all 7 requirements (daemon crashes, RPC failures, pool disconnections, miner restart, stale locks, environment reset) and maps them to specific detection and recovery mechanisms.

2. **Logical Approach**: The 9-step methodology is sound:
   - Research phase (steps 1-3): Reviews documentation and existing patterns
   - Design phase (steps 4-7): Defines structure, capabilities, and recovery strategies
   - Implementation phase (steps 8-9): Creates and verifies the JSON output

3. **Concrete Evidence Proposed**: The plan specifies 8 verifiable evidence items including:
   - Complete JSON structure validation
   - All 7 requirements mapped to responsibilities
   - All 4 decision types (recovery_successful, recovery_failed, environment_reset, error) in outputs
   - Proper RPC endpoints defined
   - Dependencies on 7 related agents
   - Specific error handling strategies
   - Recovery procedures for each failure type
   - File written to exact path

4. **Technical Depth**: Shows strong understanding of:
   - Process monitoring (ps, systemctl)
   - RPC connectivity testing
   - Lock file management
   - Service orchestration sequences
   - Error escalation patterns

5. **Integration Awareness**: Identifies dependencies on bitcoin_daemon_manager, pool_server_manager, miner_manager, network_monitor, stratum_monitor, log_analyzer, and diagnostics_agent.

**Minor Concerns:**
1. The plan mentions "Already read" several files but this is a new task evaluation - this suggests the designer has context from previous work, which is acceptable for continuity.
2. Step 1 mentions using Grep for lines 378-449 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md - the plan should verify this file exists, though the designer appears confident.

**Verification Capability:**
The evidence items are ALL verifiable by:
- JSON structural validation (parseable, well-formed)
- Content inspection (counting responsibilities, decisions, endpoints)
- File existence check at specified path
- Cross-reference with documented requirements

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Strong**

The proposed evidence is:
- **Specific**: File path, section counts (7 requirements, 4 decisions, 7 dependencies)
- **Measurable**: Can count and verify each element
- **Comprehensive**: Covers structure, content, functionality, and integration
- **Testable**: JSON can be parsed, sections enumerated, requirements cross-checked

The 8 evidence points directly map to the requirements and provide concrete proof of completion.

**Final Determination:**
This is a well-researched, logically structured plan with concrete, verifiable evidence. The designer shows domain knowledge of mining infrastructure, agent patterns, and error recovery strategies. All requirements are addressed with specific implementation approaches. The evidence proposed would definitively prove task completion.
