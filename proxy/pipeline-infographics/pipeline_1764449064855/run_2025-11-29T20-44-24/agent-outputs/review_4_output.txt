ASSESSMENT:

This plan demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Technical Build Plan document and the existing repository state. The planner correctly identified that skeleton files already exist and that the project is intended to be a Bitcoin Core v26.0 fork. The 12-phase breakdown aligns well with the source document.

However, there are significant concerns:

1. **Scope Ambiguity**: The plan correctly identifies a critical decision point (Option A vs Option B) but does not resolve it. A good plan should make a clear recommendation and proceed accordingly, not leave the core approach undecided.

2. **Evidence Quality Issues**:
   - "Compilation success on all platforms" - vague, doesn't specify what artifacts to verify
   - "Unit test results (all passing)" - good but dependent on tests existing first
   - "Genesis block hash values" - concrete and verifiable
   - "Address prefix verification" - concrete and verifiable
   - "Mining RPC output examples" - concrete
   - "Network sync demonstration" - vague, how will this be demonstrated?

3. **Feasibility Concerns**: Forking Bitcoin Core v26.0 and integrating it properly is an enormous undertaking. The plan lists steps but doesn't address:
   - Where will the Bitcoin Core source be obtained/cloned?
   - How will the massive codebase integration be verified?
   - What's the actual scope - are we doing ALL 12 phases or just starting with core phases?

4. **Missing Prioritization**: The plan lists all 12 phases but doesn't clearly state which phases will be tackled in this implementation session. The Medium confidence rating suggests the planner is uncertain about feasibility.

5. **Incomplete Understanding**: The plan doesn't specify:
   - Concrete file counts/changes expected
   - How to verify the LWMA algorithm actually works
   - How genesis block mining will be accomplished (tooling?)

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Weak

The proposed evidence is partially concrete (genesis hash, address prefixes, RPC outputs) but several items are vague ("compilation success", "network sync demonstration"). More critically, the plan doesn't specify exactly what files/outputs will prove each phase is complete.

**Key Issues**:
- Core architectural decision (fork vs skeleton expansion) is left unresolved
- Evidence collection is inconsistent - some concrete, some vague
- Scope is unclear - attempting all 12 phases is unrealistic for a single implementation session
- Medium confidence with unresolved questions is a red flag

The plan shows good research but lacks the decisiveness and specificity needed for execution. It should either:
1. Commit to Option A or B with justification
2. Scope down to achievable phases (e.g., Phases 1-5 only)
3. Specify exact verification criteria for each completed phase

DECISION: REJECTED
