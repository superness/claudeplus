UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to read the technical build plan document for Super Axe Coin (AXE) and implement the system according to that specification. This will involve understanding the architecture, components, and requirements outlined in the plan, then building out the cryptocurrency/token system.

APPROACH: First read the technical build plan to understand what needs to be built, then systematically implement each component according to the specification. This will likely involve creating smart contracts, agent systems, or other blockchain-related code as defined in the document.

STEPS:
1) Read `doc/TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md` using the Read tool to understand the full specification
2) Explore the existing codebase structure using Glob to understand what's already implemented (based on git log showing "Initialize SuperAxeCoin repository structure with core implementation files")
3) Read any existing implementation files to understand current state
4) Create a detailed todo list breaking down the build into manageable components based on the technical plan
5) Implement each component sequentially:
   - Core token/coin mechanics
   - Agent group system (referenced in recent commit)
   - Any smart contracts or blockchain integrations
   - Supporting infrastructure (APIs, utilities, etc.)
6) Write tests for each component as they are built
7) Validate the implementation against the technical plan requirements

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will need to understand what testing framework is specified in the technical plan
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for agent group interactions
- Edge cases for token operations (transfers, minting, burning if applicable)
- Security considerations for any cryptographic operations

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the contents of the technical build plan
- Show existing codebase structure
- Document each implementation step with code references
- Demonstrate test coverage for implemented features

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to first read the technical build plan to understand the full scope. The recent commits suggest there's already some structure in place, which will inform the implementation approach. Confidence will increase after reviewing the specification.
