ASSESSMENT: 

The plan demonstrates a reasonable high-level approach but has several significant weaknesses:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the first critical step: reading the technical build plan
- Acknowledges existing codebase needs to be explored
- Mentions testing as part of the implementation process
- Honest about medium confidence due to unknown specification details

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Premature specificity without information**: The plan lists specific implementation items (token mechanics, smart contracts, APIs) before actually reading the technical plan. This is speculative and could be completely wrong.

2. **Vague evidence collection**: "Document each implementation step with code references" and "Demonstrate test coverage" are not concrete. What specific artifacts will prove completion? What metrics define success?

3. **No verification criteria**: How will we know the implementation matches the spec? There's no mention of a checklist or validation step comparing implemented features against the technical plan's requirements.

4. **Missing completion definition**: What constitutes "done"? All features implemented? Tests passing? Code compiling? This is undefined.

5. **The plan essentially says "read the doc, then figure it out"**: While pragmatic, this means we're approving a plan that admits it doesn't know what it's actually building yet.

**What would make this stronger:**
- Read the technical plan FIRST, then create a concrete implementation plan
- Define specific success criteria based on the actual spec
- List verifiable deliverables (e.g., "X contract deployed", "Y tests passing", "Z endpoints functional")

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Insufficient

The proposed evidence is too vague. "Show existing codebase structure" and "document each implementation step" don't provide verifiable proof of completion. There's no concrete success criteria tied to the technical plan's actual requirements.

DECISION: REJECTED

The plan is putting the cart before the horse. It proposes implementation steps before understanding what needs to be built. The correct first step should be: read the technical plan, THEN create a detailed implementation plan with specific, verifiable deliverables. Return to planning after the document has been read and a concrete build plan with measurable success criteria can be created.

DECISION: REJECTED
