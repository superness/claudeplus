UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to read the technical build plan document and implement the Super Axe Coin (AXE) cryptocurrency project according to the specifications outlined in that document.

APPROACH: First read the technical build plan to understand the full scope, architecture, and requirements, then create a comprehensive implementation plan based on what's specified.

STEPS:
1) Read `doc/TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md` using the Read tool to understand the complete technical specifications
2) Explore the existing codebase structure using Glob to understand what's already implemented (based on git history showing "Initialize SuperAxeCoin repository structure with core implementation files")
3) Read any existing implementation files to understand current state
4) Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:
   - Core blockchain/token implementation
   - Agent group architecture (mentioned in recent commit)
   - Smart contract logic if applicable
   - API/interface layers
   - Testing infrastructure
5) Break down implementation into phases based on dependencies
6) Identify external dependencies and tooling requirements

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will need to understand what testing framework is specified in the build plan
- Unit tests for core token/coin logic
- Integration tests for agent groups
- Edge cases around token transfers, minting, burning
- Security considerations for cryptocurrency implementations

EVIDENCE:
- Contents of TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md showing requirements
- Current codebase structure and existing files
- Mapping between plan requirements and implementation tasks
- Dependency graph showing build order

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to first read the technical build plan to understand the full scope before I can provide a high-confidence implementation plan. The existence of a detailed technical document and initial repository structure suggests a well-defined project.

Let me first read the technical build plan to create a detailed implementation strategy.

DECISION: plan_complete
