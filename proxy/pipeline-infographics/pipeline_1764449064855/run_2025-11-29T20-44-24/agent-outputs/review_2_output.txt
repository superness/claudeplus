Now I have a complete picture of the project. Let me provide my assessment:

---

**ASSESSMENT:**

The planning proposal is **inadequate for the scope and complexity of this task**. The TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md document describes a **12-phase, comprehensive cryptocurrency implementation** based on a Bitcoin Core fork, but the planner's proposal is vague and underspecified.

**Critical Issues with the Plan:**

1. **Scope Misunderstanding**: The technical build plan describes forking Bitcoin Core (a 1M+ line codebase), renaming ~1000s of files, implementing LWMA, mining genesis blocks, creating builds for 5+ platforms, and launching infrastructure. The planner's "approach" merely says "read the document and create a detailed implementation plan" without acknowledging this is a massive undertaking.

2. **Missing Feasibility Analysis**: The build plan explicitly requires:
   - Cloning and modifying Bitcoin Core v26.0
   - Cross-platform compilation (Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM)
   - Mining actual genesis blocks
   - DNS seed setup and network infrastructure
   - Block explorer deployment
   
   None of this is feasible in a single Claude session. The plan doesn't address this fundamental constraint.

3. **Evidence Collection is Weak**: The "evidence" listed is generic:
   - "Contents of TECHNICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md" (already read)
   - "Current codebase structure" (already explored)
   - "Mapping between plan requirements and implementation tasks" (vague)
   
   No specific, verifiable completion criteria are defined.

4. **Existing Code Status Ignored**: There is already substantial code in the repository:
   - `src/chainparams.cpp` (267 lines) - Fully implemented mainnet, testnet, regtest parameters
   - `src/consensus/params.h` (112 lines) - Complete consensus parameters
   - `src/pow.cpp` (225 lines) - LWMA algorithm fully implemented
   - `src/validation.cpp` (292 lines) - Block subsidy and validation implemented
   - `test/functional/test_framework.py` (162 lines) - Test framework scaffolding
   - Documentation in `doc/` and `contrib/bitaxe/`

   The plan doesn't acknowledge what's already done vs. what remains.

5. **No Concrete Deliverables**: What specifically will be "built"? The plan doesn't specify whether we're:
   - Completing missing implementations
   - Adding unit tests
   - Creating build system files
   - Mining genesis blocks
   - All of the above

**EVIDENCE_QUALITY:** Insufficient

The proposed evidence is non-specific and doesn't define concrete, verifiable outcomes. "Mapping between plan requirements and implementation tasks" is not evidence - it's planning. Real evidence would be:
- Specific files created/modified with line counts
- Tests that pass/fail
- Compilation success on specific platforms
- Mined genesis block hashes

**DECISION:** REJECTED

The plan must be revised to:
1. Acknowledge what's already implemented (Phases 2, 3, 4 are largely complete)
2. Identify specific remaining work items with verifiable outputs
3. Provide realistic scope for what can be accomplished
4. Define concrete completion evidence (e.g., "LWMA unit tests pass", "genesis block mined with hash X")

DECISION: REJECTED
