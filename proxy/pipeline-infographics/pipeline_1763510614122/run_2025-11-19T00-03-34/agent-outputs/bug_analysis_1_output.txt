Perfect! I now understand the complete bug. The objective says "Craft **and equip**" but the completion check only verifies `modules_crafted >= 1`. It doesn't check if a module has been fitted.

Now let me trace through one more time to ensure I understand the complete architecture. Looking at the code I've reviewed:

**Current Architecture:**
1. ✅ `CraftingManager.completeCraftingJob()` fires `craftingJobCompleted` event (line 176)
2. ✅ `SpaceshipSimulator.setupMissionEventListeners()` listens for `craftingJobCompleted` (line 326)
3. ✅ Event handler calls `playerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted()` (line 330)
4. ✅ `recordModuleCrafted()` increments `statistics.modules_crafted` and calls `checkObjectiveProgress()` (lines 552, 559)
5. ✅ `ShipFittingManager.fitItem()` fires `shipStatsUpdated` event (line 222)
6. ✅ `SpaceshipSimulator.setupMissionEventListeners()` listens for `shipStatsUpdated` (line 336)
7. ❌ **BUG**: The `shipStatsUpdated` event listener doesn't track fitting completion for missions!

The bug is in `SpaceshipSimulator.js` lines 356-360. When a module is fitted, the listener logs a message but **doesn't actually record the fitting** or trigger any mission progress check that includes fitting status.

Let me now create the complete bug analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Quest objective 'Craft and equip your first ship module' only tracks crafting, not equipment fitting",
  "expectedBehavior": "Quest should complete when player both crafts a module AND equips it to their ship",
  "actualBehavior": "Quest completes after crafting but before equipping, OR quest may not complete at all if the fitting check interferes with the crafting completion logic",
  "affectedSystems": ["PlayerProgressionManager", "quest objectives", "mission tracking", "ShipFittingManager event handling"],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Start the game and begin the first mission (Capsuleer Cadet phase)",
    "Step 2: Obtain materials and craft a ship module (e.g., basic afterburner)",
    "Step 3: Verify modules_crafted counter increments to 1",
    "Step 4: Equip the crafted module to the ship",
    "Step 5: Observe that quest objective 'first_crafting' may show as incomplete despite description requiring both craft AND equip"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/PlayerProgressionManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The quest objective 'first_crafting' has description 'Craft and equip your first ship module' but the completion check only verifies modules_crafted >= 1. There is no verification that a module has actually been fitted to the ship. The shipStatsUpdated event listener exists in SpaceshipSimulator.js (lines 336-362) but only logs a message - it doesn't record fitting completion or trigger any mission progress update. The objective needs either: (1) Add a modules_fitted counter to statistics and update the objective target to check both modules_crafted >= 1 AND modules_fitted >= 1, OR (2) Change the objective description to only say 'Craft your first ship module' to match the actual implementation."
}
```
