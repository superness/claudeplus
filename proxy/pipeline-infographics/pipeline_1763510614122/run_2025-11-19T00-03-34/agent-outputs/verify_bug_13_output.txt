## Bug Verification Analysis

### Evidence Checklist

✅ **Evidence file exists**: `bug_evidence_1763511774872.json`  
✅ **Evidence file contains "commands" array**: 18 WebSocket commands with responses  
✅ **Evidence file contains bug status**: `"status": "BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED"`  
✅ **Console log file path present**: `C:\\Users\\super\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ChromeTest_1763411549485\\chrome_debug.log`  
✅ **Console logs array populated**: 5 console error entries (all Chrome GCM errors, not game-related)  
✅ **Test script was EXECUTED**: Commands show actual runtime state  
✅ **Runtime state snapshots captured**: Quest state, player stats, inventory data all captured  

### Console Log Analysis

**Console Error Count**: 5  
**Console Exception Count**: 0  
**Console Errors**: All 5 errors are Chrome GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) authentication errors:
- `DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT` (3 occurrences)
- `Authentication Failed: wrong_secret` (1 occurrence)
- `Failed to log in to GCM` (1 occurrence)

**Error-to-Bug Correlation**: **NONE**. All console errors are browser infrastructure errors unrelated to quest system or game logic.

### WebSocket Command Analysis

**Critical Evidence Sequence**:

1. **Initial quest state** (lines 52-68):
   - Quest: "Craft and equip your first ship module"
   - Target: `modules_crafted: 1` (ONLY checks crafting, NOT fitting)
   - Completed: `false`
   - Progress: `0/1`

2. **After crafting** (lines 441-453):
   - Quest status: **`completed: true`**
   - Statistics: `modules_crafted: 1`
   - Progress: `1/1`

3. **After fitting** (lines 671-683):
   - Quest status: **STILL `completed: true`** (no change)
   - Statistics: `modules_crafted: 1` (no change)
   - No `modules_fitted` counter exists

### Root Cause Confirmation

The evidence confirms the **DESIGN BUG**:

- **Quest description**: "Craft **and equip** your first ship module"
- **Quest target**: Only checks `modules_crafted: 1`
- **Actual behavior**: Quest completes after crafting, BEFORE equipping
- **Expected behavior**: Quest should require BOTH crafting AND fitting

**The quest completes prematurely** because the target definition is incomplete. The test shows:
- Line 449: Quest completed after crafting (before fitting command at line 568)
- Line 568: fitItem command succeeded
- Line 679: Quest STILL completed (no change when fitting occurred)

### Evidence Quality

**Runtime Evidence Present**: ✅ YES  
**Console Logs Present**: ✅ YES  
**Console Errors Correlate**: ❌ NO (only Chrome infrastructure errors)  
**WebSocket Responses**: ✅ YES (show quest completing after craft, ignoring fit)  
**State Inconsistency**: ✅ YES (quest says "craft AND equip" but only checks crafting)  
**Matches Bug Report**: ✅ YES (quest completes without requiring fitting)

## Verification Result

```json
{
  "verification": "BUG_CONFIRMED",
  "reasoning": "WebSocket evidence proves the quest completion logic is incomplete. Quest description requires 'Craft and equip your first ship module' but the target definition only checks modules_crafted:1 with NO verification that a module was fitted. Evidence shows quest completed at line 449 after crafting, BEFORE the fitItem command at line 568. This is a design bug where the quest target does not match the quest description.",
