Perfect! Now I've fixed the framework error. The issue was that the script was trying to pass `evidence.questData.craftingJobId` directly as a parameter when the scenario was defined, but at that point the value didn't exist yet. 

I've made the following changes:

1. **Changed `params` to a function** for commands that need dynamic values:
   - `completeCraftingJob` now uses `params: () => ({ jobId: evidence.questData.craftingJobId })`
   - `fitItem` now uses `params: () => ({ itemId: evidence.questData.craftedItemId, slotType: 'mid', slotIndex: 0 })`

2. **Updated `sendCmd` function** to evaluate function params at execution time:
   - Now checks if `params` is a function and calls it to get the actual parameters
   - This ensures the values are resolved when the command is executed, not when the scenario is defined

This fix allows the reproduction script to:
- Create the crafting job and capture the `jobId`
- Use that captured `jobId` when completing the crafting job
- Use the crafted item ID when fitting the item

The script should now run successfully through all steps without the "Missing required parameter: jobId" error.
