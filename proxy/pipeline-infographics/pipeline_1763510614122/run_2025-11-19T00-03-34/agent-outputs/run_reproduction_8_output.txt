**Summary:**
- ✅ Environment setup successful (HTTP server with `-c-1`, Chrome processes killed)
- ✅ Reproduction script found and executed
- ✅ ChromeManager successfully captured console logs (5 entries)
- ✅ Evidence file generated with console log data
- ❌ **Framework Error Detected**: Script has bug in command #11

**Framework Error Details:**
The reproduction script called `completeCraftingJob` without the required `jobId` parameter. The command failed with:
```
"Missing required parameter: jobId"
```

The script created crafting job with ID `job_1` (step 10) but didn't pass it to `completeCraftingJob` (step 11).

**Partial Test Results:**
Before the script failure, the test successfully verified:
- Quest objective exists (`first_crafting`)
- Quest description: "Craft and equip your first ship module"
- Quest target: `modules_crafted: 1`
- Initial progress: 0/1 modules crafted
- Player stats: 0 modules crafted, 0 modules fitted

**What We Couldn't Test:**
Due to the script bug, we couldn't verify:
- Whether quest completes prematurely after crafting (Bug Case 1)
- Whether quest properly requires equipping (Bug Case 2)
- Module fitting detection logic

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
