Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and looks comprehensive. Let me verify it has the correct structure and follows the template properly:

**Analysis of the existing script:**

✅ **Correct variable naming** - Uses `testClientServer` (line 19) for server-side and `testClient` (line 20) for client-side WebSocket objects
✅ **Comprehensive test flow** - Tests both scenarios:
  - Bug Case 1: Quest completes after crafting but BEFORE equipping
  - Bug Case 2: Quest doesn't complete even AFTER equipping
✅ **Proper evidence collection** - Tracks quest state before crafting, after crafting, and after equipping
✅ **ChromeManager integration** - Uses ChromeManager for browser control and console log capture
✅ **Clear bug reproduction logic** - Verifies if quest requires both craft AND equip per description

**The script tests:**
1. Initial mission state and quest objective
2. Crafting the afterburner module
3. Checking if quest incorrectly completes after crafting only
4. Equipping the afterburner
5. Verifying if quest properly completes after equipping

This is a well-designed reproduction script that will capture comprehensive evidence about the quest completion bug.

## Summary

**✅ Reproduction script is ready!**

**Script:** `/mnt/c/github/superstarships/test_quest_craft_and_fit_bug.js`

**What it tests:**
1. ✅ Gets initial quest state (finds "first_crafting" objective)
2. ✅ Tracks player statistics (`modules_crafted`, `modules_fitted`)
3. ✅ Crafts an afterburner module
4. ✅ **Critical Check:** Verifies if quest incorrectly completes after crafting but BEFORE equipping
5. ✅ Equips the afterburner to ship
6. ✅ **Final Check:** Verifies if quest properly completes after BOTH craft AND equip

**Bug detection logic:**
- **Scenario 1:** If quest completes after step 3 (crafting) but before step 5 (equipping) → BUG REPRODUCED (quest completes too early)
- **Scenario 2:** If quest does NOT complete after step 5 (equipping) → BUG REPRODUCED (quest doesn't detect equipped items)

**Evidence collected:**
- Quest objective state at each stage
- Player progression statistics (`modules_crafted`, `modules_fitted`)
- Browser console logs via ChromeManager
- Complete command/response history

**To run:**
```bash
node test_quest_craft_and_fit_bug.js
```
