Perfect! I've created a comprehensive bug reproduction script that tests the quest completion logic for the "Craft and equip your first ship module" objective.

## Script Overview

**File:** `test_quest_craft_and_fit_bug.js`

### Test Flow:

1. **Get initial mission state** - Locate the "first_crafting" objective and check its status
2. **Get initial player statistics** - Record baseline modules_crafted and modules_fitted counters
3. **Dock at station** - Create test station and dock (required for crafting/fitting)
4. **Add crafting materials** - Use test mode to add tritanium and pyerite
5. **Start crafting job** - Craft an afterburner module (bp_afterburner_1mn)
6. **Complete crafting** - Force-complete the job in test mode
7. **Check stats after crafting** - Verify modules_crafted incremented
8. **Check quest BEFORE equipping** - **BUG CHECK**: Quest should NOT complete here
9. **Verify inventory** - Confirm crafted item is in inventory
10. **Fit the afterburner** - Equip to mid slot 0
11. **Verify fitted** - Confirm item is actually fitted
12. **Check stats after fitting** - Record final statistics
13. **Check quest AFTER equipping** - **BUG CHECK**: Quest SHOULD complete now

### Bug Detection Logic:

The script detects the bug in two ways:

1. **Early Completion**: If the quest completes after crafting but BEFORE equipping (step 8), this indicates the quest only checks `modules_crafted >= 1` and ignores the "equip" requirement.

2. **No Completion**: If the quest does NOT complete after both crafting AND equipping (step 12), this indicates the quest completion logic is broken despite the player meeting all requirements.

### Evidence Collection:

The script captures:
- Initial and final quest states
- Player progression statistics at each stage
- All command responses
- Chrome console logs with error tracking
- Detailed quest data including description, targets, and progress
