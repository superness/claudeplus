Perfect! Now I have found the complete root cause. Let me document the execution flow and the bug:

## Root Cause Analysis Complete

```json

      "problem": "Event listener detects fitting but only logs a message. It does NOT call any method to record the fitting (e.g., playerProgressionManager.recordModuleFitted())"

  "executionFlow": [
    "1. Player crafts afterburner via CraftingManager.completeCraftingJob()",
    "2. CraftingManager fires 'craftingJobCompleted' event (CraftingManager.js:176)",
    "3. SpaceshipSimulator.setupMissionEventListeners() receives event (SpaceshipSimulator.js:326-332)",
    "4. Event handler calls playerProgressionManager.recordModuleCrafted() (SpaceshipSimulator.js:330)",
    "5. recordModuleCrafted() increments statistics.modules_crafted to 1 (PlayerProgressionManager.js:552)",
    "6. recordModuleCrafted() calls checkObjectiveProgress() (PlayerProgressionManager.js:559)",
    "7. checkObjectiveProgress() evaluates 'first_crafting' objective (PlayerProgressionManager.js:578-591)",
    "8. isObjectiveComplete() checks: statistics.modules_crafted >= 1 → TRUE (PlayerProgressionManager.js:615-618)",
    "9. Quest COMPLETES at this point (before fitting)",
    "10. Player then fits afterburner via ShipFittingManager.fitItem()",
    "11. ShipFittingManager fires 'shipStatsUpdated' event (ShipFittingManager.js:222)",
    "12. SpaceshipSimulator receives event (SpaceshipSimulator.js:336-362)",
    "13. Event listener logs message but does NOT record fitting or trigger progress update",
    "14. Quest remains completed (no change after fitting)"
  ],
  "whyItHappens": "The quest objective has a design mismatch: the description requires TWO actions ('Craft and equip'), but the target definition only tracks ONE action (modules_crafted:1). When a player crafts a module, the quest completes immediately without verifying the equip step. The shipStatsUpdated event listener exists but only logs; it doesn't call any method to record the fitting action because there is no modules_fitted counter in the statistics object.",
  "proposedFix": "Add modules_fitted counter to statistics object and update the 'first_crafting' quest target to require BOTH modules_crafted >= 1 AND modules_fitted >= 1. Create recordModuleFitted() method in PlayerProgressionManager and call it from the shipStatsUpdated event listener."
