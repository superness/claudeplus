Looking at the validation evidence, I can now provide a comprehensive fix verification analysis.

## Fix Validation Analysis

### 1. Review Fix

**What was the bug?**
- Quest objective "Craft and equip your first ship module" was completing after crafting only
- The completion check only verified `modules_crafted >= 1`, ignoring the "equip" requirement
- Tutorial progression was blocked because the quest didn't properly track fitting

**What fix was applied?**
1. Added `modules_fitted` counter to PlayerProgressionManager statistics
2. Updated quest objective to require `{modules_crafted: 1, modules_fitted: 1}`
3. Enhanced completion check to validate ALL crafting-related requirements with AND logic
4. Created `recordModuleFitted()` method to track fitting actions
5. Wired up `shipStatsUpdated` event listener to call `recordModuleFitted()`

**What should WebSocket responses show now?**
- Initial state: quest incomplete, both counters at 0
- After crafting: quest still incomplete, `modules_crafted: 1`, `modules_fitted: 0`
- After fitting: quest complete, `modules_crafted: 1`, `modules_fitted: 1`

### 2. Analyze Post-Fix Evidence

From `bug_evidence_1763512076495.json`:

```json
{
  "questBehavior": {
    "initialState": {
      "completed": false,
      "modules_crafted": 0,
      "modules_fitted": 0
    },
    "afterCrafting": {
      "completed": false,
      "modules_crafted": 1,
      "modules_fitted": 0
    },
    "afterFitting": {
      "completed": true,
      "modules_crafted": 1,
      "modules_fitted": 1
    }
  },
  "testVerdict": "Quest completes correctly after BOTH crafting AND equipping"
}
```

### 3. Compare Before vs After

**Before Fix:**
- Quest would complete immediately after crafting (or fail to complete at all)
- `modules_fitted` counter didn't exist
- Objective only checked `modules_crafted >= 1`
- `shipStatsUpdated` event listener only logged, didn't track

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Quest stays incomplete after crafting only (`completed: false`, `modules_fitted: 0`)
- ✅ Quest completes after fitting (`completed: true`, both counters at 1)
- ✅ Both tracking counters working correctly
- ✅ Event listener properly records fitting action

**Match with Expected Behavior:** **PERFECT MATCH**

### 4. Check Regressions

**Test Execution:**
- 18 commands executed successfully
- Exit code: 0 (clean completion)
- No JavaScript exceptions (`consoleExceptionCount: 0`)
- 5 console errors (all Chrome GCM registration, not game-related)

**System Checks:**
- ✅ Crafting system: Still works correctly (counter increments)
- ✅ Fitting system: Still works correctly (counter increments) 
- ✅ Quest tracking: Now validates BOTH requirements
- ✅ Event listeners: Both `craftingJobCompleted` and `shipStatsUpdated` working
- ✅ Statistics tracking: Both counters functioning independently

**New Errors:** None
**Broken Commands:** None
**Status:** No regressions detected

### Validation Result

```json
{
  "validation": "FIX_VERIFIED",
  "bugResolved": true,
  "beforeAfterComparison": {
    "before": "Quest completed after crafting only (or failed to complete), ignoring the 'equip' requirement",
    "after": "Quest correctly requires BOTH crafting AND equipping before marking complete",
    "match": "Perfect match with expected behavior - quest stays incomplete after crafting (modules_fitted: 0), then completes after fitting (modules_fitted: 1)"
  },
  "regressionCheck": {
    "newErrors": [],
    "brokenCommands": [],
    "status": "No regressions - crafting and fitting systems both working correctly",
    "additionalValidation": "18 commands executed successfully with clean exit code 0"
  },
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "evidence": {
    "initialState": "Quest incomplete with both counters at 0",
    "afterCrafting": "Quest remains incomplete with modules_crafted=1, modules_fitted=0",
    "afterFitting": "Quest completes with modules_crafted=1, modules_fitted=1",
    "counterTracking": "Both statistics counters working independently and correctly"
  },
  "tutorialProgression": "No longer blocked - quest completes correctly after both required actions"
}
```

## Summary

The bug fix has been **completely verified**. The quest objective "Craft and equip your first ship module" now correctly:

1. ✅ Tracks crafting actions (`modules_crafted` counter)
2. ✅ Tracks fitting actions (`modules_fitted` counter)  
3. ✅ Requires BOTH actions to complete (AND logic in completion check)
4. ✅ Stays incomplete after crafting only
5. ✅ Completes after both crafting AND fitting
6. ✅ No regressions in crafting or fitting systems
7. ✅ Tutorial progression no longer blocked

**DECISION: FIX_VERIFIED**
