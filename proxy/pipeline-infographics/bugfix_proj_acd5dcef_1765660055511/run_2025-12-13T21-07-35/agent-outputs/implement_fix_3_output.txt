**Changes Made**:

File: `client/game.js`
- Line 1004: Added `piece: move.piece` to the saved state object in `saveState()`, storing a direct reference to the moved piece
- Lines 1027-1041: Rewrote `restoreState()` to use the direct piece reference instead of searching through all pieces with broken logic

**Why This Fixes It**:
The original bug was in the search logic that tried to find which piece was moved during AI simulation. The condition `p.isKing === state.pieceIsKing || (p.x !== state.pieceX || p.y !== state.pieceY)` would match almost every piece on the board because:
- OR logic means ANY piece with the same king status matches, OR
- ANY piece not at the original position matches

This caused random pieces to be moved during board state restoration after each minimax evaluation, corrupting the board state cumulatively.

The fix stores a direct reference to the actual piece in `saveState()`, eliminating the need for any search logic. `restoreState()` now simply uses that reference to restore the correct piece to its original position.

**Testing Suggestion**:
1. Start a new game / refresh the page
2. Make one move as red
3. Verify only the AI makes a single, valid move in response
4. Continue playing several moves to ensure the board state remains consistent
