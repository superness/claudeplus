I can see the fix that was applied. Let me now create the documentation summary.

**Bug Fix Summary**:

**Bug**: Multiple game pieces change position after player's first move, as if several turns occurred

**Root Cause**: The `restoreState()` function used during AI minimax evaluation had broken logic for finding the piece to restore. The original condition `if (p.isKing === state.pieceIsKing || (p.x !== state.pieceX || p.y !== state.pieceY))` matched almost every piece on the board instead of the specific piece that was moved during simulation. This caused cumulative board corruption during AI move evaluation.

**Fix**: Store a direct reference to the moved piece in `saveState()` and use that reference in `restoreState()` instead of searching through all pieces with faulty logic.

**Files Modified**:
- `client/game.js:1002-1041`: 
  - `saveState()`: Added `piece: move.piece` to store direct piece reference (line 1004)
  - `restoreState()`: Replaced broken search loop with direct piece manipulation:
    - Remove piece from simulated position
    - Restore x, y, and isKing properties from saved state
    - Place piece back on board at original position
    - Restore captured piece if any

**Impact**:
- AI move evaluation now correctly preserves board state during minimax search
- No side effects - the fix is minimal and focused on the broken logic
- Performance slightly improved by eliminating unnecessary piece search loop

**Testing Notes**:
1. Start a new game or refresh the page
2. Make one move as Red
3. Verify only one Black piece moves in response (plus any multi-jump continuations)
4. Continue playing several turns to confirm stable board state
5. Test AI at all difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to verify minimax depth variations work correctly

**Comments Added**:
- `client/game.js:1029`: Added comment "Remove piece from its current (simulated) position"
- `client/game.js:1031`: Added comment "Restore piece to original position"
