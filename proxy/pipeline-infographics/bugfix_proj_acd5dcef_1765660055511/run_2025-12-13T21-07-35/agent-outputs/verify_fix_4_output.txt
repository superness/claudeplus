I have now reviewed the modified `game.js` file. Let me analyze the fix applied to the `saveState()` and `restoreState()` methods.

**Fix Review**:
The fix stores a direct reference to the moved piece (`piece: move.piece`) in `saveState()` at line 1004, and uses that direct reference in `restoreState()` (lines 1027-1041) to properly restore the piece to its original position after minimax simulation. This eliminates the broken search logic that was previously corrupting the board state.

**Completeness Check**:
- [x] Root cause addressed - The fix directly resolves the bug by storing a reference to the piece being moved, eliminating the faulty search logic
- [x] Edge cases handled - The fix works for all pieces (kings and non-kings) and handles captured pieces correctly
- [x] Defensive coding applied - The code properly removes the piece from its simulated position before restoring it to the original position

**Regression Analysis**:
No regressions detected. The fix is minimal and focused:
1. The `saveState()` function now stores `piece: move.piece` - this is safe because the piece object reference is stable
2. The `restoreState()` function properly:
   - Removes the piece from its current (simulated) position
   - Restores the piece's x, y, and isKing properties
   - Sets the piece back on the board at its original position
   - Restores captured pieces if any

The fix maintains all existing functionality:
- Multi-jump handling is unchanged
- King promotion during simulation is still tracked and restored
- Captured piece restoration is still handled correctly
- The minimax algorithm continues to work as expected with proper state management

**Game-Specific Checks**:
- Works for all game states (initial, mid-game, end-game)
- No save/load implications (this is browser-based with no persistence)
- Single-player vs AI only, no multiplayer implications
- Performance is actually improved by eliminating the unnecessary search

**Verdict**:
The fix is complete, correct, and safe. The implementation stores a direct reference to the piece rather than relying on broken search logic. The `restoreState()` function properly cleans up the simulated position before restoring the original state. This should completely resolve the bug where multiple pieces were moving after a single player move.
