## Infrastructure State Analysis

**Current Infrastructure State:**

✓ **Daemon Status**: 
- Processes running (PIDs 38018, 55550) - Bitcoin daemon appears active
- Config exists at ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf with RPC settings configured
- **ISSUE**: bitcoin-cli not found - daemon may be running but CLI tools missing

✗ **Pool Status**:
- Pool server (CoiniumServ) NOT running
- Config exists at build/bin/Debug/config/config.json but is incomplete (missing pool definitions)

✗ **Mining Ports**:
- No ports detected on 18443 (RPC) or 3333 (Stratum)
- Suggests daemon may not be properly accessible or pool not started

**Dependencies Status**:
- bitcoind: Processes running but `bitcoin-cli` command not found
- mono: Not verified yet
- CoiniumServ: Binary not verified

**Configuration Status**:
- Daemon config: EXISTS but may need validation
- Pool config: EXISTS but INCOMPLETE (missing pool configurations, only has global settings)

**Identified Gaps:**

1. **Missing/Incomplete Dependencies**: bitcoin-cli missing, need full dependency verification
2. **Incomplete Configurations**: Pool config lacks pool definitions (coin configs, daemon connection settings)
3. **Daemon Health Unknown**: Processes running but cannot verify RPC accessibility without bitcoin-cli
4. **Pool Not Running**: Cannot proceed with miner until pool is operational

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The infrastructure is in a **partial state** - some daemon processes exist, configs are partially present, but critical components are missing or incomplete. This suggests either:
- Previous incomplete setup attempt
- Missing dependency installations
- Configuration generation didn't complete fully

**Strategic Decision:**

Starting with **dependency verification** is critical because:
1. Cannot validate daemon health without bitcoin-cli tools
2. Cannot verify mono runtime for CoiniumServ without proper checks
3. Missing tools will cause cascading failures in subsequent steps
4. Dependencies are the foundation - must be solid before proceeding

Once dependencies are verified/installed, will need to:
- Regenerate complete pool configuration (current config missing pool definitions)
- Verify/restart daemon with proper RPC accessibility
- Set up pool server
- Configure miner
- Validate end-to-end

DECISION: delegate_dependency_check

REASONING:
Infrastructure is in partial state with critical gaps identified:
- Daemon processes running but bitcoin-cli command missing (cannot validate RPC)
- Pool config incomplete (missing pool definitions)
- Mono runtime not verified for CoiniumServ
- Cannot proceed with setup/validation without complete dependency stack

Dependencies are the foundation layer - all other components depend on having complete Bitcoin Core tools (bitcoind + bitcoin-cli), Mono runtime, and mining software properly installed. Starting with comprehensive dependency check to establish solid foundation before addressing configuration and component setup.
