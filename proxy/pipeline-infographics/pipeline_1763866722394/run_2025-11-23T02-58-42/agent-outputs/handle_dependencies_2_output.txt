Perfect! All dependencies are installed and verified. Let me create a final summary:

## DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION COMPLETE

### Summary

All required dependencies for the Bitcoin mining infrastructure have been successfully installed and verified:

### ✓ Installed Components

**1. Bitcoin Core (v27.0.0)**
- Location: `/home/super/bitcoin/bin/`
- bitcoind v25.0.0 (running, PID 38018)
- bitcoin-cli v27.0.0 (verified)
- RPC connectivity verified (331 blocks on regtest)
- Credentials configured (coiniumtest/testpass123)

**2. Mono Runtime (v6.8.0.105)**
- Full runtime with JIT compiler
- .NET 4.5 framework support
- Successfully executes CoiniumServ.exe

**3. CoiniumServ Pool Server**
- Executable: `build/bin/Debug/CoiniumServ.exe` (443KB)
- Framework: .NET 4.5
- Can execute with Mono runtime ✓

**4. CPUMiner (v2.5.1)**
- Location: `/home/super/cpuminer/minerd`
- CPU features: x86_64, SSE2, AVX, AVX2, XOP
- Built with libcurl 7.71.0 and mbedTLS

**5. Build Tools & Libraries**
- GCC 13.3.0
- Autoconf 2.71, Automake 1.16.5
- libcurl-dev, libssl-dev, libjansson-dev

### ✓ Configuration Changes

**PATH Updates** (persisted to `~/.bashrc`):
- `/home/super/bitcoin/bin` - Bitcoin Core tools
- `/home/super/cpuminer` - CPU miner

### ✓ Issues Resolved

1. **bitcoin-cli not in PATH** → Added to PATH and verified connectivity
2. **Missing build dependencies** → Installed autoconf, automake, curl/ssl/jansson libraries

### ✓ Validation Results

- All dependencies present: **YES**
- All components functional: **YES**  
- Bitcoin RPC connectivity: **YES** (331 blocks)
- Runtime environments: **YES** (Mono + .NET)

### Next Steps Required

Infrastructure is ready for:
1. Pool server configuration (config.json needs pool definitions)
2. Starting CoiniumServ pool server
3. Configuring and starting miner
4. End-to-end mining validation
