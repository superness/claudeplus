ASSESSMENT: This is a well-structured plan for creating a bitcoin daemon manager agent. Let me evaluate each aspect:

**Understanding**: The plan correctly identifies that this is about creating an agent JSON file that manages Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode. All key requirements are captured: installation verification, configuration generation, daemon control, status queries, block generation, and wallet management.

**Approach Logic**: The 8-step approach is methodical and logical:
- Steps 1-3: Research phase (read plan document + examine existing agent examples)
- Steps 4-6: Design phase (create prompt, define permissions and decisions)
- Steps 7-8: Implementation phase (structure JSON and write to file)

This follows a good pattern of understanding requirements → learning from examples → designing → implementing.

**Specific Evidence Proposed**:
The plan proposes multiple concrete pieces of evidence:
1. Reference to specific content from section 2.1 of the plan document
2. Structure comparison with existing agent JSON examples
3. The complete agent JSON file itself
4. Demonstration that all 8 requirements are addressed in the prompt (with specific checklist)
5. Confirmation of tool permissions matching requirements
6. Confirmation of decision points matching requirements
7. JSON syntax validation

**Test Considerations**: The plan shows thoughtful consideration of edge cases:
- Daemon already running
- Port conflicts
- Data directory issues
- Existing wallets
- Installation verification
- Error handling for start failures
- RPC connection handling

**Potential Concerns**:
1. The plan doesn't specify *how* it will demonstrate that the prompt adequately covers each requirement - it just says "Will demonstrate" but doesn't detail the verification method
2. No mention of testing the generated JSON (e.g., validating it against a schema or attempting to load it)
3. The "structure comparison with existing agents" is mentioned but not detailed about what specifically will be compared

**Strengths**:
- Clear step-by-step execution plan
- All required fields identified (tools, decisions, prompt content)
- Good awareness of edge cases
- High confidence is justified given this is a structured file creation task with existing patterns

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong - The plan will produce:
- A complete, syntactically valid JSON file at the specified path
- A prompt covering all 8 stated requirements
- Proper tool permissions and decision arrays
- Can be verified by examining the final JSON file content

The evidence is tangible and verifiable. The final JSON file can be inspected to confirm it contains all required elements.

**Minor Improvement Suggestions** (not blocking):
- Could specify using a JSON validator to confirm syntax
- Could be more explicit about prompt structure (how instructions will be organized)

DECISION: APPROVED (Design approved, proceed to implementation)
