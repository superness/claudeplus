UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a bitcoin_daemon_manager agent based on section 2.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. This agent will manage Bitcoin daemon lifecycle in regtest mode, including installation verification, configuration generation, daemon control, status queries, block generation, and wallet management. The agent JSON should be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand section 2.1 specifications
2. Review existing agent examples to understand the JSON structure and pattern
3. Design the agent with appropriate prompts, tools, and decision logic
4. Create comprehensive prompt that covers all required bitcoin daemon management capabilities
5. Define proper tool permissions (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)
6. Define decision points (daemon_started, daemon_stopped, daemon_error, error)
7. Write the complete agent JSON to the specified path

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/private-SuperCoinServ/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md, specifically section 2.1
2) Use Glob tool with pattern "**/agents/*.json" to find existing agent examples
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing agent JSON files to understand structure
4) Design agent prompt that includes:
   - Bitcoin daemon installation verification (checking for bitcoind binary)
   - Regtest configuration file generation (bitcoin.conf with regtest settings)
   - Daemon start commands with proper regtest flags
   - Graceful daemon shutdown procedures
   - RPC commands for status queries (getblockchaininfo, getnetworkinfo)
   - Block generation functionality (generatetoaddress)
   - Wallet creation and funding in regtest mode
5) Define tool permissions array: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep"]
6) Define decisions array: ["daemon_started", "daemon_stopped", "daemon_error", "error"]
7) Structure the complete agent JSON with:
   - name: "bitcoin_daemon_manager"
   - description: Summary of agent capabilities
   - prompt: Detailed instructions for bitcoin daemon management
   - tools: Permission array
   - decisions: Decision points array
8) Use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/agents/bitcoin_daemon_manager.json with complete agent definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Plan will verify section 2.1 content exists and is complete in the plan document
- Will ensure agent structure matches existing agent patterns from examples
- Will include handling for bitcoind not being installed (installation verification)
- Will include error handling for daemon start failures
- Will include proper RPC connection handling and timeouts
- Will include validation of regtest mode configuration
- Will consider edge cases like daemon already running, port conflicts, data directory issues
- Will ensure wallet creation handles existing wallets gracefully
- Will verify generatetoaddress handles different block counts and addresses

EVIDENCE:
- Will reference specific content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 2.1
- Will show structure comparison with existing agent examples
- Will provide the complete agent JSON with all required fields
- Will demonstrate that all requirements are addressed in the prompt:
  * Installation verification steps
  * Configuration generation commands
  * Start/stop procedures
  * Status query RPC calls
  * Block generation commands
  * Wallet creation/funding commands
- Will confirm tool permissions match requirements
- Will confirm decision points match requirements
- Will validate JSON syntax is correct

CONFIDENCE: High - This is a structured task with clear requirements and existing patterns to follow. Reading the plan document and existing agents will provide clear guidance for creating the new agent JSON with appropriate prompts and configuration.

[DECISION: design_complete]
