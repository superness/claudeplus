I'll analyze this request to determine the appropriate classification.

**Analysis:**

**Key Indicators:**
- "There is a bug" - explicitly states this is a bug
- "not persisting" - functionality that should work but doesn't
- "when the browser is reloaded, all fitted items are lost" - describes broken behavior
- "needs to save...and restore" - describes what should happen but currently doesn't

**Request Breakdown:**
1. **Problem Statement**: Ship fitted items are lost on page refresh (broken functionality)
2. **Expected Behavior**: Fitted items should persist across browser sessions
3. **Required Actions**: 
   - Investigate the ship fitting system
   - Identify missing persistence
   - Implement save/load functionality
   - Create tests for verification

**Classification Reasoning:**

This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** because:
- The user explicitly identifies it as "a bug"
- There's a failure in expected functionality (data persistence)
- The system should be saving state but isn't
- This is fixing broken behavior, not adding new features
- The implementation work (adding localStorage) is to *fix* the broken persistence, not to add a new feature

This is NOT a FEATURE_REQUEST because:
- Persistence is typically expected functionality in a fitting system
- The user frames it as something that's broken, not something new to add
- It's restoring expected behavior, not creating new capabilities

**Context Summary:**

```json
{
  "classification": "BUG_FIX",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "reasoning": "User explicitly identifies this as a bug where expected functionality (data persistence) is not working. Ship fitted items should persist across page refreshes but currently don't. This requires fixing broken save/load functionality.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "Ship fitted items not persisting across page refreshes - need to implement proper save/load functionality",
    "keyIndicators": ["bug", "not persisting", "are lost", "needs to save"],
    "affectedArea": "Ship fitting system, data persistence, localStorage",
    "priority": "high",
    "technicalScope": "Investigate ShipFittingUI.js/ShipFittingManager.js, implement localStorage save/load, create persistence tests",
    "expectedBehavior": "Fitted items should survive browser refresh"
  }
}
```

DECISION: BUG_FIX
