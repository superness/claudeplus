ASSESSMENT: 

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding of the 7-stage pipeline structure and sequence
- Specific plan to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.1 for specifications
- Intelligent approach to examine existing templates to understand JSON schema
- Proper identification of all components: bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, pool_server_manager, rpc_tester, daemon_pool_connector
- Sequential dependency chain is well understood (stage N depends on stage N-1)
- Specific output path clearly defined
- Good test considerations covering edge cases

**Weaknesses:**
- Medium confidence without having verified the source document exists
- Uncertainty about whether template directory exists
- JSON schema structure not yet known (dependent on discovering existing templates)
- Parameter definitions and timeout/retry policies not specified (to be determined from examples)

**Critical Evaluation:**
The plan demonstrates a methodical, discovery-based approach which is appropriate given the unknowns. The designer correctly identifies that they need to:
1. Verify source specifications exist
2. Learn the schema from existing examples
3. Apply the pattern to the new pipeline

This is a sound engineering approach rather than making assumptions.

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: Strong

The proposed evidence is concrete and verifiable:
- Will provide actual contents of section 3.1 (source specification)
- Will show example template structures (schema reference)
- Will produce the complete JSON file content (deliverable)
- Will confirm file exists at specified path (proof of delivery)

Each evidence item directly proves a critical aspect of task completion.

DECISION: APPROVED
