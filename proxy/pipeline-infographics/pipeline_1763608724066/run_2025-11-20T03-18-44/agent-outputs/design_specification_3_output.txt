UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a daemon-pool-integration pipeline based on section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline has 7 specific stages with defined flow from start_daemon through to rpc_integration_verified, and the output should be written as JSON to a specific path.

APPROACH: 
1. First, read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.1 and get context on the pipeline architecture, stage definitions, and any specific requirements
2. Examine existing pipeline JSON files in the templates directory to understand the expected JSON schema and structure
3. Map the 7 stages provided to the correct JSON format with proper stage configurations, dependencies, and component references
4. Validate the pipeline structure matches the specification in section 3.1
5. Write the complete pipeline JSON to the specified output path

STEPS:
1. Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and locate section 3.1 for detailed specifications
2. Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline JSON files: `templates/**/*.json` or `**/*pipeline*.json`
3. Use Read tool to examine 1-2 example pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure
4. Based on the documentation and examples, design the JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - 7 stages defined with: stage name, component reference, inputs, outputs, dependencies
   - Stage flow: start_daemon → configure_pool_rpc → start_pool → test_rpc_calls → generate_test_block → validate_template → rpc_integration_verified
5. Map each stage to its component:
   - start_daemon: bitcoin_daemon_manager
   - configure_pool_rpc: config_generator
   - start_pool: pool_server_manager
   - test_rpc_calls: rpc_tester
   - generate_test_block: bitcoin_daemon_manager
   - validate_template: daemon_pool_connector
   - rpc_integration_verified: END condition
6. Define dependencies between stages to ensure proper sequential execution
7. Add error handling, timeout configurations, and validation criteria per stage based on section 3.1 requirements
8. Verify the output directory exists: use Bash `ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/`
9. Write the complete JSON structure to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/daemon-pool-integration.json using Write tool

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will validate that the pipeline JSON follows the exact stage order specified (1-7)
- Will ensure all component references (bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, etc.) match the naming conventions from existing pipelines
- Will verify stage dependencies are correctly chained so each stage waits for its predecessor
- Will check that the END stage (rpc_integration_verified) properly terminates the pipeline
- Will validate JSON syntax is correct and can be parsed
- Will ensure the file path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists before writing
- Will consider edge cases like stage failures, timeouts, and retry logic based on section 3.1 specifications

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the content of section 3.1 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing the source specifications
- Will show examples of existing pipeline JSON structure for schema reference
- Will display the complete generated daemon-pool-integration.json with all 7 stages properly configured
- Will show directory listing confirming the output file location exists
- Will verify the JSON is valid and matches the required stage flow

CONFIDENCE: Medium - While the stage flow and components are clearly specified, I need to review section 3.1 of the documentation and existing pipeline examples to ensure the JSON schema, stage parameters, error handling, and component configurations match the project's standards. The complexity depends on what additional metadata and configuration each stage requires beyond the basic flow.
