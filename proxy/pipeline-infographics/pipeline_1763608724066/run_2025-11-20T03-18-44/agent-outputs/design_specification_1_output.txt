UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a pipeline JSON file for the daemon-pool-integration pipeline as specified in section 3.1 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline has 7 stages with specific agent assignments and transitions. The file needs to be written to a claudeplus/templates directory that doesn't exist yet.

APPROACH: 
1. Examine existing pipeline JSON examples in the codebase to understand the expected format
2. Review section 3.1 lines 475-490 which defines the daemon-pool-integration pipeline structure
3. Create the pipeline JSON following the standard format with all 7 stages and their transitions
4. Ensure each stage references the correct agent from the plan
5. Create the directory structure if needed and write the complete JSON file

STEPS:
1. Use Glob to search for existing pipeline JSON files in the repository: `**/*.json` with focus on templates or pipeline directories to understand the JSON schema
2. Use Grep to search for "pipeline" or "agent" in JSON files to find example structures: `pattern: "\"agent\"|\"transitions\"|\"stages\""` with `type: "json"` and `output_mode: "content"`
3. Read any example pipeline files found to understand the exact format required
4. Based on section 3.1 (lines 475-490), construct the JSON with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, purpose)
   - 7 stages array with: start_daemon, configure_pool_rpc, start_pool, test_rpc_calls, generate_test_block, validate_template, rpc_integration_verified
   - Each stage mapping to its agent: bitcoin_daemon_manager, config_generator, pool_server_manager, rpc_tester, bitcoin_daemon_manager, daemon_pool_connector
   - Transitions between stages in sequential order
   - Success criteria from the plan
5. Create the directory `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/` using Bash: `mkdir -p /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates`
6. Write the complete JSON file to `/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/daemon-pool-integration.json` using Write tool
7. Verify the file was created correctly with Read tool

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Validate JSON syntax is correct (proper escaping, comma placement, bracket matching)
- Ensure all 7 stages are present with correct agent assignments
- Verify transitions flow correctly from stage 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → END
- Check that stage IDs match the transition targets
- Confirm the pipeline structure matches similar pipelines in the plan (Appendix C example)
- Test that the directory creation works even if parent directories don't exist
- Handle the case where claudeplus directory may not exist

EVIDENCE:
- Provide the exact JSON structure created showing all 7 stages
- Show directory listing confirming the file was created at the correct path
- Display file size and basic validation that JSON is well-formed
- Reference line numbers from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing alignment with section 3.1
- Show the complete file content to verify all required elements are present

CONFIDENCE: High - The requirements are clearly specified in section 3.1 with exact stage names, agent assignments, and success criteria. The plan also includes example JSON structures in Appendix C (lines 959-970) showing the expected format. The task is straightforward file creation with well-defined inputs.
