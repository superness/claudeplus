  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly states 'There is a critical bug' and describes a specific broken workflow where ship controls become completely unresponsive after a sequence of actions (dock → build → fit → undock). The issue manifests as: inability to change navigation direction, inability to increase speed despite throttle settings, non-functional object clicking, and non-functional double-clicking. This is a functional failure requiring investigation and repair of existing systems.",
