  "reasoning": "This is clearly a bug fix request. The user explicitly labels it as 'CRITICAL BUG' and describes a core gameplay system (ship movement) that is completely non-functional. Key indicators include: 'completely non-functional', 'does not respond', 'core gameplay blocker', 'needs immediate investigation and fixing'. The request includes systematic debugging steps and requires fixing broken functionality rather than adding new features or making simple changes.",

    "originalRequest": "CRITICAL BUG: Ship movement is completely non-functional. The player ship does not respond to any navigation targets or tap-to-move commands. This is a core gameplay blocker that needs immediate investigation and fixing. Please: 1) Investigate the ship movement system to identify why ships are not responding to navigation commands, 2) Check tap/click input handling for move commands, 3) Examine the navigation target system, 4) Fix the root cause of the movement failure, 5) Test that ships properly respond to movement commands after the fix.",
