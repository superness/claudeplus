Now I have enough information. Let me analyze the bug and create the analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship fitting object is undefined when double-clicking inventory items in StationUI, causing TypeError when accessing fitting.hull property",
  "expectedBehavior": "When a user double-clicks an item in their inventory at a station, the autoFitItem function should retrieve the ship fitting for the current ship (player_ship_1), access the hull's slot information, and automatically fit the item to the first available slot of the appropriate type",
  "actualBehavior": "The autoFitItem function calls getShipFitting(this.currentShipId) which returns undefined, causing a TypeError when trying to access fitting.hull.baseStats.slots[slotType] at line 1605",
  "affectedSystems": ["ship-fitting", "inventory", "station-ui", "player-progression"],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Start the game and navigate to a station",
    "Step 2: Dock at the station to open the Station UI",
    "Step 3: Navigate to the Ship Fitting tab in the station interface",
    "Step 4: Double-click any fittable item in the inventory panel",
    "Step 5: Observe console error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading hull)' at StationUI.js:1605"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/ui/StationUI.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/ShipFittingManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The root cause is that getShipFitting(this.currentShipId) returns undefined because either: (1) this.currentShipId is set to 'player_ship_1' but the ShipFittingManager initializes the player ship with a different ID (this.playerShipId), creating a mismatch, OR (2) the ship fitting has not been initialized yet when StationUI tries to access it. Looking at the code, ShipFittingManager.initializePlayerShip() stores the fitting using this.playerShipId as the key, but StationUI hardcodes this.currentShipId = 'player_ship_1'. If these IDs don't match, getShipFitting will return undefined. The fix requires either: (A) ensuring StationUI uses the same shipId that ShipFittingManager uses for the player ship, or (B) adding null-checking before accessing fitting.hull to provide a better error message and graceful degradation."
}
