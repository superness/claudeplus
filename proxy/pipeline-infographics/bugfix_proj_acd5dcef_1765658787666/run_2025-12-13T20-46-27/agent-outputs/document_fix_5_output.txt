I have all the information I need to document the fix.

**Bug Fix Summary**:

**Bug**: AI makes multiple independent moves after player moves, appearing to play for both sides

**Root Cause**: During multi-jump continuation, `executeAIMove()` called `aiSystem.chooseBestMove()` which returns ANY valid black move, not just continuation jumps from the piece that was mid-jump. This allowed the AI to switch pieces and execute multiple independent moves instead of a proper multi-jump sequence.

**Fix**: Modified `executeAIMove()` to accept an optional `multiJumpPiece` parameter. When continuing a multi-jump, the function now calls `getContinuationJumps(multiJumpPiece)` to get only valid jumps for the specific jumping piece, rather than `chooseBestMove()` which would get all black moves.

**Files Modified**:
- `client/game.js:1237-1297`: Refactored `executeAIMove()` function
  - Added `multiJumpPiece` parameter (default `null`)
  - Added conditional logic to choose between `getContinuationJumps()` (for multi-jump continuations) and `chooseBestMove()` (for initial AI moves)
  - Modified recursive call at line 1289 to pass `move.piece` for continuation

**Impact**:
- AI now correctly executes multi-jump sequences with a single piece
- Turn control properly returns to the human player after AI finishes its turn
- No impact on human player move handling (separate code path)
- No impact on initial AI move selection

**Testing Notes**:
1. Start a new game as red
2. Make a move that allows the AI to capture
3. Verify AI makes one move (or completes a multi-jump sequence with the same piece)
4. Verify control returns to the red player
5. Test AI multi-jump: Position pieces so AI can make consecutive jumps - verify it uses the same piece throughout

**Comments Added**:
- `client/game.js:1240`: "// Continuing a multi-jump - only get jumps for this specific piece"
- `client/game.js:1244`: "// Initial AI move - choose best move from all options"
- `client/game.js:1287`: "// Continue AI multi-jump with the same piece"
