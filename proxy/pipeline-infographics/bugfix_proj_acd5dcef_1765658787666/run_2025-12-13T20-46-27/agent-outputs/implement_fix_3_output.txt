The fix is implemented.

**Changes Made**:

File: `client/game.js`
- Modified `executeAIMove()` to accept an optional `multiJumpPiece` parameter (line 1237)
- Added logic to check if we're in a multi-jump continuation (lines 1239-1246):
  - If `multiJumpPiece` is provided, use `getContinuationJumps()` to get only valid jumps for that specific piece
  - If no piece is provided (initial AI move), use `chooseBestMove()` as before
- Updated the recursive call (line 1289) to pass `move.piece` when continuing a multi-jump

**Why This Fixes It**:

The bug occurred because during a multi-jump sequence, the AI would call `chooseBestMove()` which returns ANY valid move for black, not just continuation jumps from the piece that was already jumping. This allowed the AI to make multiple independent moves in what should be a single turn.

By passing the piece to the recursive call and using `getContinuationJumps()` for that specific piece, the AI now only considers continuation jumps from the same piece during a multi-jump sequence. When there are no more continuation jumps, the turn ends properly.

**Testing Suggestion**:

1. Start a game against the AI (black)
2. Make moves as red that force the AI into situations where multi-jump opportunities exist
3. Observe that the AI:
   - Only makes one move (or one multi-jump sequence) per turn
   - Properly ends its turn after moves
   - When multi-jumping, continues with the same piece only
