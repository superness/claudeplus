Now I have a clear understanding of the game. This is an American Checkers game where the user plays as red and an AI plays as black. Let me analyze the bug related to the AI making "a LOT of moves".

**Bug Summary**: AI executes multiple moves in rapid succession after player makes a single move, playing for both sides

**Expected Behavior**: When the red (human) player makes one move, the AI (black) should make one move (or a multi-jump sequence if capturing), then control should return to the human player.

**Actual Behavior**: When the player makes a move as red, the AI appears to make many moves in succession, potentially playing for both black AND red.

**Affected Systems**: Turn System, AI System, Game Controller (move execution flow)

**Severity**: HIGH - This breaks core gameplay by taking control away from the player

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Start a new game of American Checkers
2. As red player, make any valid move
3. Observe the AI making multiple moves consecutively

**Likely Source Files**: 
- `client/game.js` - specifically:
  - `GameController.executeMove()` (lines 1168-1224)
  - `GameController.scheduleAIMove()` (lines 1226-1234)
  - `GameController.executeAIMove()` (lines 1237-1289)
  - `TurnSystem.endTurn()` (lines 299-304)

**Initial Hypothesis**: 

The bug is in `executeAIMove()` (lines 1237-1289). Looking at the flow:

1. After the human moves, `executeMove()` calls `scheduleAIMove()` at line 1211-1212
2. `scheduleAIMove()` calls `executeAIMove()` after a 500ms delay
3. In `executeAIMove()`:
   - The AI makes its move (lines 1245-1256)
   - It checks for multi-jump continuation (lines 1259-1265)
   - **Problem at lines 1278-1288**: When `continueJumping` is true, it recursively calls `executeAIMove()` again after 400ms
   - When `continueJumping` is false, it calls `turnSystem.endTurn()` at line 1285

The critical issue: After the AI's turn ends at line 1285 (`turnSystem.endTurn()`), **there's no guard to prevent the AI from immediately moving again**. The turn changes to 'red', but the code doesn't check whether it should trigger another AI move or wait for player input.

Additionally, looking more closely at line 1285: `this.turnSystem.endTurn()` switches `currentPlayer` to 'red'. However, the `scheduleAIMove()` function in `executeMove()` has this check:

```javascript
if (this.isAIEnabled && this.turnSystem.currentPlayer === 'black') {
    this.scheduleAIMove();
}
```

This seems correct, but there could be a race condition or the AI might be getting re-triggered from somewhere else. The AI might also be choosing moves for both players if `getAllMoves()` in the AI system isn't properly filtering by the correct player during the turn check.

Another possibility: The `aiSystem.chooseBestMove()` at line 1238 **always** gets moves for black (hardcoded in `getAllMoves()` at line 855). But if the turn has already switched back to red, the game state is inconsistent - the AI is operating while it's red's turn, but choosing moves for black pieces.
