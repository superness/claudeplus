Now I have a complete picture of the fix. Let me provide my verification:

---

**Fix Review**:
The fix modifies `executeAIMove()` to accept an optional `multiJumpPiece` parameter. When continuing a multi-jump sequence, the AI now uses `getContinuationJumps(multiJumpPiece)` to get only valid jumps for that specific piece, rather than calling `chooseBestMove()` which would get ALL valid black moves.

**Completeness Check**:
- [x] Root cause addressed - The fix correctly identifies when we're in a multi-jump continuation and restricts moves to the jumping piece only
- [x] Edge cases handled - The code handles:
  - Initial AI move (no `multiJumpPiece`) → uses `chooseBestMove()`
  - Continuation jump (`multiJumpPiece` provided) → uses `getContinuationJumps()`
  - No continuation jumps available (`move = null`) → exits gracefully via line 1247-1250
- [x] Defensive coding applied - The `aiThinking` flag prevents overlapping AI moves (line 1227), and turn checks in `scheduleAIMove()` (line 1211) ensure AI only plays when it's black's turn
- [x] Proper piece passing - Recursive call at line 1289 correctly passes `move.piece` to continue with the same piece

**Regression Analysis**:
No regressions detected. The change is isolated to the AI multi-jump logic and:
1. Does not affect human player moves (handled separately in `executeMove()`)
2. Does not affect the turn system logic
3. Does not change AI move selection for initial moves (still uses `chooseBestMove()`)
4. The `getContinuationJumps()` method (line 1095-1097) correctly delegates to `captureSystem.getAvailableJumps()` which only returns jumps for the specific piece passed in
5. The `getAllMoves()` method (line 854-868) is hardcoded to get moves for 'black' only, so the AI was never accidentally playing red moves

**Verdict**:
The fix is correct and complete. The original bug was that during a multi-jump sequence, the AI would call `chooseBestMove()` on each continuation, which returns ANY valid black move rather than just continuation jumps from the piece that was mid-jump. This allowed the AI to switch pieces mid-turn and execute multiple independent moves.

The fix properly threads the jumping piece through the recursive call chain and uses `getContinuationJumps()` to restrict the AI to only continuation jumps from that specific piece during multi-jump sequences.
