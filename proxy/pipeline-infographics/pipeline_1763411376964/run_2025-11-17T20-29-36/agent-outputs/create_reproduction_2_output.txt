Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and is well-structured. Let me verify it has all the required components:

✓ **Chrome Console Log Capture**: Lines 310-327 launch Chrome with `--enable-logging` and `--v=1`
✓ **Console Log Parsing**: Lines 181-227 parse chrome_debug.log for errors and exceptions  
✓ **Evidence with Console Logs**: Lines 429-437 include consoleLogFile, consoleLogs, consoleErrorCount, and consoleExceptionCount
✓ **Available Commands Used**: Uses `getShipState` and `setThrottle` (both verified in GameTestingInterface.js)
✓ **Test Scenario**: Comprehensive test that:
  - Checks initial state (should be stationary)
  - Sets throttle to 50%
  - Waits 100ms and checks if ship instantly jumped to speed (>80% = bug)
  - Waits 500ms total to observe acceleration curve
  - Sets throttle to 0% and tests deceleration
  - Checks if ship instantly stopped (<0.1 speed = bug)
✓ **Evidence Format**: Saves detailed velocity measurements with timestamps

The script is complete and ready to execute. It will:

1. Launch Chrome with console logging enabled
2. Connect to the game via WebSocket automation
3. Test both acceleration and deceleration for instant velocity jumps
4. Capture Chrome console logs including any JavaScript errors
5. Save comprehensive evidence with velocity measurements and console logs

The test is designed to detect the bug by checking if ships reach >80% of target speed in only 100ms (instant) vs the expected ~10-20% with proper exponential acceleration.

**DECISION: script_ready**
