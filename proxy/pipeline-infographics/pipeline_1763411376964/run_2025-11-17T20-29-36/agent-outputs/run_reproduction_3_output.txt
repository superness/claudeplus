The logs show the WebSocket had errors. Looking at the evidence file, I can see the command was sent but returned `undefined`. This indicates a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** - the test infrastructure itself is failing, not the bug being tested.

Let me generate a comprehensive report:

## Execution Summary

### Environment Setup: ✅ PASSED
- HTTP server running with cache disabled (-c-1)
- No old Chrome processes interfering
- Working directory correct

### Test Execution: ✅ COMPLETED
- Script executed: `reproduce_instant_throttle_bug.js`
- Chrome launched with console logging enabled
- Game connected to WebSocket server
- Test client connected

### Command Execution: ❌ FAILED
- **setThrottle command sent** but returned `undefined`
- Expected response structure not received
- No velocity measurements could be taken

### Console Logs: ✅ CAPTURED
- **Console log file**: `C:\Users\super\AppData\Local\Temp\ChromeTest_1763411549485\chrome_debug.log`
- **3 console errors** captured (GCM authentication - unrelated to test)
- **1 WebSocket error** detected: `[TestingBrowserBridge] WebSocket error: [object Event]`

### Evidence File: ✅ GENERATED
- **File**: `instant_throttle_bug_evidence_1763411554440.json`
- Includes console logs, commands sent, and failure status
- Shows command was received but response was undefined

### Framework Issue Detected

The test infrastructure has a critical failure:
1. **WebSocket Error**: TestingBrowserBridge logged a WebSocket error
2. **Command Response Undefined**: setThrottle command returned `undefined` instead of the expected response object
3. **No Response Data**: The command appears to have been sent (`commandObj` in response) but no actual result came back

This is a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR** because:
- The test environment is set up correctly
- The game loads and runs
- BUT the command execution pipeline is broken
- Cannot determine if the bug exists because commands aren't working

DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR
