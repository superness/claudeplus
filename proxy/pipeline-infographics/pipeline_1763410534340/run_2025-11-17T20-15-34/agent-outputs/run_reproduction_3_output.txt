The issue is that the response had `success: false` but no error message, so it showed "undefined". The game is not responding to WebSocket commands properly. This is a FRAMEWORK_ERROR - the testing infrastructure is not working correctly.

Let me generate the final report:

```

## Summary

The reproduction script executed but encountered a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR**:

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Chrome Launch Problem**: Script uses basic `cmd.exe /c start chrome` without proper debugging flags
   - Missing: `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
   - Missing: `--enable-logging --v=1`
   - Missing: Proper user-data-dir path

2. **WebSocket Command Failure**: Game connected but didn't respond properly to `getShipState` command
   - Response had `success: false` 
   - No error message provided
   - Command queue processing stopped immediately

3. **Console Logs Not Captured**: Evidence file missing all console log fields
   - No `consoleLogFile` field
   - No `consoleLogs` array
   - No console error/exception counts

**Environment Status:**
- ✅ HTTP server running with `-c-1` (no caching)
- ✅ Old Chrome processes killed
- ✅ Working directory correct
- ❌ Chrome not launched with required flags
- ❌ Console logs not captured
- ❌ WebSocket framework not functioning

The bug cannot be verified with this test infrastructure. The script needs to be updated to use proper Chrome DevTools Protocol automation (like the template specifies) instead of basic browser launching.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR**
