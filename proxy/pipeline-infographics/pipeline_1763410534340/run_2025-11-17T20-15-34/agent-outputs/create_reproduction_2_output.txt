Perfect! The reproduction script already exists and looks well-structured. Let me verify it has all the required components according to the template:

✅ **Chrome Console Logging**: Lines 310-311 include `--enable-logging` and `--v=1`
✅ **Console Log Path**: Line 12 defines chromeLogPath
✅ **Console Log Parser**: Lines 181-227 implement parseConsoleLogs()
✅ **Evidence Format**: Lines 429-437 include consoleLogFile, consoleLogs, consoleErrorCount, consoleExceptionCount
✅ **Test Scenario**: Lines 26-178 define comprehensive test steps including:
  - Get initial ship state (should be stationary)
  - Set throttle to 50%
  - Wait 100ms and check if ship instantly jumped to speed (critical bug check)
  - Wait 500ms to observe full acceleration curve
  - Set throttle to 0% to test deceleration
  - Wait 100ms and check if ship instantly stopped (critical bug check)

The script tests the exact bug described:
1. Ships instantly jumping to throttle speed (acceleration check at line 84)
2. Ships instantly stopping when throttle is reduced (deceleration check at line 166)

The verification thresholds are appropriate:
- After 100ms at 50% throttle, if ship is at >80% of target speed → BUG (instant jump)
- After 100ms at 0% throttle, if ship speed is <0.1 → BUG (instant stop)

The script saves comprehensive evidence including:
- All WebSocket commands and responses
- Console logs from chrome_debug.log
- Velocity measurements at each test point
- Clear BUG_REPRODUCED or BUG_NOT_REPRODUCED status

**DECISION: script_ready**
