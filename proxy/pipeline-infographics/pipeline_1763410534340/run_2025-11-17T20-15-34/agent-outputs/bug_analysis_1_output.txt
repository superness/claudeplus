Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me create the analysis:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ships instantly jump to throttle speed instead of smoothly accelerating/decelerating with exponential curves",
  "expectedBehavior": "When throttle (W/S keys) is adjusted, ships should gradually accelerate or decelerate using EVE Online's exponential acceleration formula: V(t) = V_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ)). Ships should have momentum and take time to reach target speed based on their agility stat.",
  "actualBehavior": "When pressing W/S to adjust throttle level, the ship's velocity instantly changes to match the new throttle setting with no acceleration curve. The exponential physics are bypassed, making movement feel unrealistic and arcade-like instead of having EVE-style ship inertia.",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "physics",
    "movement",
    "input",
    "ship-control"
  ],
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open game in browser (index.html)",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and ship to spawn",
    "Step 3: Press 'W' key once to increase throttle from 0% to 10%",
    "Step 4: Observe ship velocity in HUD - ship should gradually accelerate but instead jumps instantly to 10% of max speed",
    "Step 5: Press 'W' multiple times to increase throttle to 100%",
    "Step 6: Observe that ship velocity instantly matches throttle percentage instead of gradually ramping up with exponential curve",
    "Step 7: Press 'S' to decrease throttle",
    "Step 8: Observe that ship instantly slows down to new throttle speed instead of gradually decelerating"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The bug occurs because the throttle level (0-1) from InputManager is being directly multiplied by maxVelocity to set targetVelocity, but the exponential acceleration physics in applyExponentialAcceleration() (ShipPhysics.js:158-166) is working correctly. The problem is that targetVelocity is being recalculated every frame based on current thrust input, so it instantly changes when throttle changes. The exponential physics then tries to smoothly approach this new targetVelocity, but since targetVelocity itself is changing instantly, the ship appears to jump to the new speed. The fix requires changing targetVelocity to be persistent and only modified gradually based on throttle changes, not recalculated from scratch each frame."
