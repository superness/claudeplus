The GameTestingInterface looks correct. The problem is that the response is not being sent back. Let me create a simple diagnostic script to test if the automation framework is actually working:

## Execution Report

    "TestingBrowserBridge may not be sending responses back through WebSocket",
    "Script exited with code 1 (command failed)",
    "Evidence file shows COMMAND_FAILED status",
    "Multiple previous test runs show identical failure pattern"
  ],
  "rootCauseAnalysis": [
    "The automation framework connection is established (game connects, test connects)",
    "Commands are being sent from test client to game client through WebSocket relay",
    "The response coming back is the echoed command, not an actual response",
    "This indicates either:",
    "  1. GameTestingInterface.handleCommand is not being called",
    "  2. GameTestingInterface.handleCommand is not returning a response",
    "  3. TestingBrowserBridge.sendResponse is not sending the response",
    "  4. The WebSocket relay is incorrectly forwarding messages",
    "Based on code review, TestingBrowserBridge should call sendResponse() which wraps response in type:'response'",
    "The fact that we receive type:'command' suggests the command is being echoed, not the response"
  ]
}
```
