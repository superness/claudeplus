## Framework Fix Complete

### Problem Identified
The WebSocket automation framework had a **client identification mismatch** between the game browser bridge and the reproduction script:

- **TestingBrowserBridge.js** connected to `ws://localhost:8765` without query parameters
- **Reproduction script** expected clients to identify themselves via URL query parameter `?client=game` or `?client=test`
- Without the query parameter, the reproduction script couldn't identify the game client, leaving `gameClientConnection` as null
- Commands from the test client had nowhere to be forwarded, causing immediate failures

### Root Cause
```javascript
// BEFORE (TestingBrowserBridge.js:12)
constructor(gameInterface, serverUrl = 'ws://localhost:8765') {
```

The reproduction script checked:
```javascript
// reproduce_ship_movement_bug_fixed.js:170
const clientType = url.searchParams.get('client');
if (clientType === 'game') {
  gameClientConnection = ws;
```

Since no `?client=game` parameter was sent, `clientType` was always `null`, the game was never registered, and command routing failed.

### Fix Applied
Updated **js/testing/TestingBrowserBridge.js:12** to include the client identification parameter:

```javascript
// AFTER
constructor(gameInterface, serverUrl = 'ws://localhost:8765?client=game') {
```

### Impact
- Game client will now properly identify itself to the reproduction script
- WebSocket server can correctly route commands: Test Client → Game Client
- Game responses will be properly forwarded back: Game Client → Test Client
- The reproduction test can now execute commands and capture ship movement evidence

### Next Step
The framework is now fixed. The reproduction test should be retried to properly diagnose the actual ship movement bug (if it exists) or confirm that ship movement is working correctly.
