Based on my analysis of the ship movement system, I've identified the root cause of the critical bug:

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Ship movement completely non-functional - navigation commands and tap-to-move inputs do not translate to actual ship movement",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player sets a navigation target (via double-tap, double-click, or UI interaction), the ship should calculate a direction vector from current position to target, apply thrust in that direction, and move toward the target using EVE-style physics",
  "actualBehavior": "Navigation targets are set correctly in InputManager and logged to console, but the ship physics system never receives thrust input commands. The ship remains stationary despite active navigation commands showing target coordinates and non-zero speedSetting values",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "physics",
    "input",
    "ship_control"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in a web browser",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load (player ship visible in 3D scene)",
    "Step 3: Double-click anywhere on the game canvas to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe console logs show 'Navigation target set' with coordinates and speedSetting=0.75",
    "Step 5: Observe ship does NOT move toward target (stays at origin position)",
    "Step 6: Open browser console and check debug logs - InputManager reports active navigation command but ShipPhysics never logs received thrust input",
    "Step 7: Alternative: Try single-tap on asteroid/anomaly, then tap 'Approach' button - same result (no movement)"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The critical missing link is in Ship.js. The navigation command from InputManager contains target coordinates and speedSetting, but there is no code that converts this navigation command into a thrust vector for the physics engine. Ship.updateWithMiningAndExploration() receives the navigationCommand but does not calculate the direction from ship.position to navigationCommand.target, normalize it, multiply by navigationCommand.speedSetting, and pass it to ship.physics.updatePhysics() as the inputThrustVector parameter. This breaks the chain: InputManager → navigation command → Ship logic → thrust vector → ShipPhysics → actual movement."
}
```
