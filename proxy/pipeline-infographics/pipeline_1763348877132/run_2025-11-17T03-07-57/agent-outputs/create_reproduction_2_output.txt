Perfect! Now let me document the script and provide the final output:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_simple.js",
  "scriptContent": "Created comprehensive Node.js reproduction script with WebSocket server",
  "commandSequence": [
    {
      "command": "listCommands",
      "expectedResult": "Verify automation framework is connected"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "Get initial ship state with position and velocity"
    },
    {
      "command": "resetGameState",
      "params": {"preserveInventory": true},
      "expectedResult": "Reset ship to origin (0,0,0) with zero velocity"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "Confirm ship is at origin with zero velocity"
    },
    {
      "command": "setNavigationTarget",
      "params": {"x": 5000, "y": 0, "z": 0, "mode": "approach"},
      "expectedResult": "Navigation target set to 5km away on X-axis"
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 2000},
      "expectedResult": "Wait 2 seconds for ship to accelerate"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "🔍 CRITICAL BUG CHECK: Ship should have velocity >1 m/s and moved >1m. If not, bug is reproduced."
    },
    {
      "command": "wait",
      "params": {"duration": 3000},
      "expectedResult": "Wait additional 3 seconds"
    },
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "expectedResult": "🔍 FINAL BUG CHECK: Ship should have speed >10 m/s and moved >50m. If not, bug is reproduced."
    }
  ],
  "evidenceFiles": ["ship_movement_bug_evidence_[timestamp].json"],
  "expectedOutcome": "Bug reproduced when ship remains at origin with zero velocity after navigation target is set. The script verifies that navigation commands are accepted by InputManager but ship physics does not receive thrust input, confirming the missing link between navigation system and physics engine.",
  "executionInstructions": [
    "1. Ensure game development server is running: npm start (or npm run dev)",
    "2. Run the script: node reproduce_ship_movement_simple.js",
    "3. Script will launch Chrome with testMode=true automatically",
    "4. Test will run for approximately 8 seconds total",
    "5. Evidence JSON file will be created with all command/response data",
    "6. Exit code 0 if test completes (bug reproduced or not reproduced)"
  ],
  "keyFeatures": [
    "Uses ONLY available automation commands from GameTestingInterface.js",
    "Includes setNavigationTarget command (verified to exist)",
    "Two-stage bug verification (2s and 5s checkpoints)",
    "Comprehensive evidence collection with all ship states",
    "Clear console output showing exact position/velocity/speed at each step",
    "Automatic Chrome launch with proper test mode parameters",
    "Saves detailed evidence JSON regardless of test outcome"
  ]
}
```

**DECISION: script_ready**
