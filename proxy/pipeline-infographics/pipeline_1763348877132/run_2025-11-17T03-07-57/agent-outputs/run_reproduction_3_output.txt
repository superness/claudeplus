The game connects to `ws://localhost:8765` without any query parameters. This means when the reproduction script checks `clientType` from the URL at line 159, it will be `null` for the game client. The game will not match either `if (clientType === 'game')` or `else if (clientType === 'test')` conditions.

This is a FRAMEWORK_ERROR - the reproduction script has a bug in how it identifies clients. The game browser bridge doesn't send the `?client=game` parameter, so the reproduction script never sets `gameClient` variable and the test fails before even executing the first command.

Let me generate the execution report:
