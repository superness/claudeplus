Based on my analysis of the available automation commands in `GameTestingInterface.js`, I can see that **the commands needed to reproduce the ship movement bug do not exist**. 

The bug involves the ship not responding to navigation targets set via clicking/tapping in space, but there is no automation command to:
1. Set a navigation target programmatically
2. Simulate a click/tap event
3. Query the current navigation target state

The only movement-related command is `setThrottle`, which only sets the thrust input but does not set a navigation destination.

  "reasoning": "The ship movement bug involves the ship not responding when navigation targets are set by clicking/tapping in space. To reproduce this bug via automation, I need to: (1) Verify the initial ship state, (2) Set a navigation target (either by coordinates or by simulating a click event), (3) Wait for the ship to attempt movement, (4) Check if the ship's velocity/position changed. However, the GameTestingInterface.js only provides a 'setThrottle' command which sets thrust input, but does NOT set a navigation target. There is no command to programmatically set a navigation target, simulate input events (click/tap), or query navigation state.",

  },
  "workaroundAttempted": "I considered using 'setThrottle' combined with 'setPosition' to check if physics is working at all, but this would NOT reproduce the actual bug. The bug is specifically about navigation target handling (clicking in space to move), not about raw throttle input. Setting throttle to 100% without a navigation target would just apply thrust in the ship's current facing direction, which is a completely different code path than the 'click-to-navigate' system that is broken. Additionally, I would need a 'getNavigationState' command to verify if the navigation target is being set correctly when clicks occur, which also doesn't exist."
