Perfect! Now let me create the JSON output summarizing what was done:

```json
{
  "commandName": "setNavigationTarget",
  "implementation": "Added setNavigationTarget command that sets a navigation target for the ship to move toward. The command accepts either explicit coordinates (x, y, z) or a targetId to look up an object (station/asteroid). It supports three navigation modes: 'approach' (default), 'orbit', and 'warp'. The implementation uses the InputManager.setNavigationTarget() method, which is the same code path as double-clicking/double-tapping in space.",
  "filesModified": ["/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/testing/GameTestingInterface.js"],
  "registrationAdded": "this.commandHandlers.set('setNavigationTarget', this.setNavigationTarget.bind(this));",
  "methodAdded": true,
  "tested": false,
  "notes": "The command integrates with the existing navigation system by calling InputManager.setNavigationTarget(), which is the same method used when players double-click in space or double-tap on mobile. This ensures the automation command uses the exact same code path as player input. The command supports both coordinate-based navigation (x, y, z) and object-based navigation (targetId), and validates the navigation mode (approach/orbit/warp). Distance to target is calculated and returned in the response."
}
```

**DECISION: command_implemented**
