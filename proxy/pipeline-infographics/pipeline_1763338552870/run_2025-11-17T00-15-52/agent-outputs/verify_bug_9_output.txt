I've analyzed all the evidence files from the WebSocket automation reproduction attempts. Here's my verification analysis:

## Evidence Analysis

### Runtime Evidence Status: **INCONCLUSIVE**

All evidence files show the **same pattern**:

1. **WebSocket server started successfully** ✅
2. **Game connected to automation server** ✅  
3. **Test client connected** ✅
4. **Commands sent but failed to execute** ❌

### Critical Finding

The evidence shows that **NO actual game state was captured**. Every attempt shows:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": {
      "id": "1",
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {}
    }
  }
}
```

This is **the command being echoed back**, not the actual game response with ship state data.

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected response** (if automation worked):
```json
{
  "response": {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "position": [x, y, z],
      "velocity": [vx, vy, vz],
      "navigationTarget": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

**Actual response** (what we got):
```json
{
  "response": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": {...}
  }
}
```

### Verification Decision

```json
{
  "verification": "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "reasoning": "No runtime game state evidence was captured. All WebSocket commands failed due to the framework bug identified in run_reproduction (nested message handlers causing command echo instead of response routing). The test infrastructure could not retrieve ship position, velocity, or navigation target data needed to verify the bug.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "Commands echoed back instead of executed",
    "stateInconsistency": "No ship state captured to analyze",
    "matchesBugReport": "Cannot verify - no game state data obtained",
    "frameworkIssue": "WebSocket automation server has nested handler bug preventing proper command/response routing"
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": "Cannot proceed to root cause analysis without runtime evidence. Options: (1) Fix WebSocket automation framework, (2) Manual testing with browser DevTools, (3) Alternative reproduction method (direct game code instrumentation)"
}
```

The previous stage correctly identified this as a **FRAMEWORK_ERROR**. The WebSocket automation infrastructure is broken and cannot capture the runtime game state needed to verify the ship movement bug.

**DECISION: INCONCLUSIVE**
