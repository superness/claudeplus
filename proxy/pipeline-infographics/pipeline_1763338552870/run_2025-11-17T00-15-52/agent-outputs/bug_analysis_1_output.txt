I'll analyze this critical ship movement bug based on the description and codebase context.

```json
{
  "bugSummary": "Player ship does not move when navigation targets are set or locations are tapped/clicked",
  "expectedBehavior": "When player sets a navigation target (via clicking/tapping in space or selecting an object), the ship should accelerate toward that target using EVE-style physics, eventually reaching it or orbiting it",
  "actualBehavior": "Ship remains stationary and does not respond to any movement commands - navigation target setting appears to have no effect on ship position or velocity",
  "affectedSystems": [
    "navigation",
    "input",
    "physics",
    "ship_control"
  ],
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Step 1: Open index.html in browser",
    "Step 2: Wait for game to load and ship to spawn",
    "Step 3: Click/tap anywhere in empty space to set navigation target",
    "Step 4: Observe ship remains stationary (no velocity change, no rotation toward target)",
    "Step 5: Alternatively, select an asteroid/station from Object Grid and click 'Navigate To'",
    "Step 6: Observe ship still does not move",
    "Step 7: Check browser console for errors or warnings"
  ],
  "likelyFiles": [
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/SpaceshipSimulator.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/core/InputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/mobile/MobileInputManager.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/entities/Ship.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/physics/ShipPhysics.js",
    "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/js/systems/NavigationManager.js"
  ],
  "hypothesis": "The issue likely stems from a broken connection in the movement command chain. Possible causes: (1) Input events (click/tap) not being captured or processed correctly by InputManager/MobileInputManager, (2) Navigation target not being set on the ship instance when input is received, (3) Ship.update() or ShipPhysics not reading/applying the navigation target during physics updates, (4) Physics update loop not running, or (5) A recent code change that disconnected the navigation target → ship acceleration pipeline. Given git status shows modifications to InputManager.js, Ship.js, and ShipPhysics.js, the bug may have been introduced in recent changes to these files.",
  "additionalContext": {
    "gitStatus": "Modified files include InputManager.js, Ship.js, ShipPhysics.js - recent changes may have introduced regression",
    "evidenceFiles": "Multiple ship_movement_bug_evidence_*.json files suggest this has been investigated before",
    "reproductionScript": "reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js exists - may contain automated test case",
    "testFiles": "test-ship-movement-bug-gamerunner.js suggests there's a test harness for this specific bug"
  },
  "investigationPriority": [
    "1. Check if physics update loop is running (console.log in Ship.update or ShipPhysics)",
    "2. Verify navigation target is being set when clicking (log ship.navigationTarget)",
    "3. Verify InputManager/MobileInputManager click handlers are firing",
    "4. Check Ship.js and ShipPhysics.js for logic that applies navigation target to velocity",
    "5. Review recent git changes to modified files for regression"
  ]
}
```
