I'll analyze the WebSocket automation evidence to verify if the ship movement bug can be confirmed.

## Evidence Analysis

### Step 1: Parse WebSocket Evidence

Looking at the execution report and evidence file `ship_movement_bug_evidence_1763338948872.json`:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "getShipState",
      "params": {"includeModules": false},
      "response": {
        "type": "command",
        "command": {
          "id": "1",
          "command": "getShipState",
          "params": {"includeModules": false}
        }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-11-17T00:22:28.872Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Assess Evidence Quality

**Runtime Evidence Present**: ❌ **NO**
- WebSocket server started successfully
- Game connected to automation server
- Test client connected successfully
- **BUT**: No actual game state data was captured

**What Was Received**:
- Command echo: `{type: 'command', command: {...}}`
- Expected: Response data: `{type: 'response', response: {success, data, error}}`

**What Was NOT Received**:
- Actual ship state (position, velocity, navigationTarget)
- Movement behavior data
- Physics update information

### Step 3: Root Cause of Evidence Failure

The execution report identifies the issue:

> "WebSocket relay forwarding command messages back to test client instead of only response messages. The relay at lines 165-168 in the script forwards all messages from game to test client, including the initial command registration messages."

**Infrastructure Problem**:
- The WebSocket automation framework is broken
- Test client receives command echoes instead of responses
- Cannot capture actual game state data
- Script exits with `COMMAND_FAILED` status

### Step 4: Bug Verification Decision

```json
{
  "verification": "FRAMEWORK_ERROR",
  "reasoning": "The WebSocket automation infrastructure is not functioning correctly. The test client receives command echoes instead of actual response data from the game. Without runtime game state data (ship position, velocity, navigationTarget), the ship movement bug cannot be confirmed or ruled out through this automation approach.",
  "evidenceAnalysis": {
    "runtimeEvidencePresent": false,
    "websocketResponses": "Only command echoes received, no response data",
    "stateInconsistency": "Cannot assess - no game state captured",
    "matchesBugReport": "Unknown - no movement data available",
    "infrastructureIssue": "WebSocket relay forwarding wrong message types to test client"
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "nextSteps": [
    "Fix WebSocket relay to only forward {type: 'response'} messages to test client",
    "Ensure game properly sends response messages (not just command echoes)",
    "Rerun automation test to capture actual ship state",
    "Alternative: Manual browser testing with console logging"
  ],
  "alternativeApproach": "Since WebSocket automation is broken, recommend manual testing: Open index.html, use browser console to log ship.navigationTarget, ship.velocity, and ship.position after clicking to navigate. This will provide runtime evidence without relying on the broken automation framework."
}
```

## Conclusion

The WebSocket automation framework has a critical infrastructure bug that prevents it from capturing the actual game state data needed to verify the ship movement bug. The test client receives command echoes instead of response messages, making runtime verification impossible with the current automation setup.

**No runtime evidence of the ship movement bug was obtained.** The automation framework itself needs to be fixed before it can be used to verify gameplay bugs.

**DECISION: FRAMEWORK_ERROR** (Test infrastructure broken, cannot verify with current automation)
