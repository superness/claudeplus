Perfect! Now let me create a summary document for this reproduction script:

```json
{
  "scriptPath": "/mnt/c/github/superstarships/reproduce_ship_movement_bug.js",
  "scriptContent": "Complete Node.js reproduction script with WebSocket server that connects to the game's automation interface",

}
```

**DECISION: script_ready**

The reproduction script has been successfully created and is ready to execute. The script:

1. **Uses ONLY available automation commands** - I verified all commands against GameTestingInterface.js
2. **Tests the critical bug** - Sets navigation target and verifies ship movement
3. **Has clear pass/fail criteria** - Ship should move > 10m and have velocity > 10 m/s after 2 seconds
4. **Saves comprehensive evidence** - All commands and responses logged to JSON file
5. **Provides detailed output** - Console shows progress and exact failure points

The script will reproduce the bug if the ship remains stationary (velocity near zero, minimal position change) after setting a navigation target, which is the exact issue described.
