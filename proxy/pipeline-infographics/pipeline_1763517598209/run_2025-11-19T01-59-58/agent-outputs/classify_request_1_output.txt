  "reasoning": "This is clearly a regression bug. The user explicitly states 'REGRESSION BUG' and describes functionality that was previously working but is now broken. Two mission tracker updates (mining and anomaly exploration) stopped working after a recent fix for crafting/fitting. This is a classic regression scenario where fixing one issue broke existing functionality.",
  "context": {
    "originalRequest": "REGRESSION BUG: The mission tracker is not updating steps for mining minerals and exploring anomalies. Previously these were working, but after fixing the crafting/fitting item mission step update, these two mission updates broke. The mission tracker shows: ⬜ Successfully mine 1000 units of Tritanium (should update when mining) and ⬜ Explore your first quantum anomaly (should update when exploring anomaly). Only the crafting step (✅ Craft and equip your first ship module) is working correctly. Investigate what change broke the mining and anomaly mission updates, restore their functionality while keeping the crafting/fitting fix working. All three mission step types should update correctly.",

**Key Indicators:**
- **Explicit bug statement**: User starts with "REGRESSION BUG"
- **Previously working**: "Previously these were working"
- **Broke after change**: "after fixing the crafting/fitting item mission step update, these two mission updates broke"
- **Not working correctly**: "is not updating steps"
- **Partial functionality**: Only crafting works, mining and anomaly exploration don't

**Classification Confidence: 98%**

This is definitively a BUG_FIX request because:
1. User explicitly labels it as a regression bug
2. Features were working, then broke after a code change
3. Current behavior is incorrect (mission steps not updating)
4. Needs investigation of what changed and restoration of functionality
5. No new features requested - just fixing broken existing functionality

DECISION: BUG_FIX
