The code looks well-structured. The integration is complete for this simple UI text change.

## Test Results

### Syntax Check
**Pass** - HTML structure is valid. All script tags and CSS links are properly formed.

### Integration Path Verification
For the name change feature:
- Entry point: HTML `<title>` tag and `.cosmic-title` container
- User visible elements:
  - `<title>SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE</title>` - Browser tab title ✓
  - `<h1 class="title-main">SUPER COSMIC</h1>` - Main heading ✓
  - `<h2 class="title-sub">TIC-TAC-TOE</h2>` - Sub heading ✓
- Old subtitle "THE ETERNAL GRID" removed ✓
- **CONNECTED: YES** - This is a static HTML change, no integration path required

### Disconnected Systems Found
None relevant to this feature. The title change is purely presentational.

### Placeholder Code Found
None related to this feature.

### Issues Found
None. The name change has been correctly applied to:
1. Browser tab title (`<title>` tag)
2. Title screen heading (split into two lines as "SUPER COSMIC" and "TIC-TAC-TOE")
3. Old subtitle "THE ETERNAL GRID" has been removed

Note: Code comments in JS/CSS files still reference the old name, but these are developer-facing documentation, not user-visible strings.
