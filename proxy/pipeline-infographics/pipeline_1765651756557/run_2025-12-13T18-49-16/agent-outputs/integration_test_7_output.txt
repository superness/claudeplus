### Visual Issues Found
**None** - The game renders beautifully with:
- Proper cosmic/space theme
- Glowing effects on symbols
- Clear UI elements
- Smooth transitions
- The new title "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE" displays correctly across all screens

### Test Issue Found
The **only failure** is in test 01 which has **hardcoded expectations for the OLD title text**:
- Test expects: `"COSMIC"` for `.title-main`
- Actual: `"SUPER COSMIC"` 
- Test expects: `.title-subtitle` with `"THE ETERNAL GRID"`
- Actual: This element no longer exists (subtitle was removed)

This is a **test code issue**, not a game issue. The test file needs to be updated to match the new title.

### Summary
- **Functional Tests**: 9/10 passed (1 failed due to outdated test assertions)
- **Visual Checks**: 10/10 passed - All visuals render correctly
- **Critical Visual Issues**: None

The game name change to "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE" has been successfully implemented and displays correctly in:
1. Browser tab title
2. Title screen (split across two lines: "SUPER COSMIC" and "TIC-TAC-TOE")
3. Return to menu functionality preserves the new title
