Change name from "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid" to **"SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE"**

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Update HTML `<title>` tag with new name
- [ ] Update title screen heading text to "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE"
- [ ] Remove or update subtitle "The Eternal Grid" if present

### Notes
- This is a branding/text change only - no gameplay or visual design changes required
- The "cosmic" theme is preserved in the new name
- The design docs contain extensive references to "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe" but the core game mechanics, lore, and systems remain unchanged
- The user's requested name is in ALL CAPS, which should be preserved for the display title
