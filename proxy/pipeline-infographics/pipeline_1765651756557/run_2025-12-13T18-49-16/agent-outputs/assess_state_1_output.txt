**Game client features:**

- Five AI difficulty levels (Void Novice → The Eternal)
- Particle effects, animations, and visual effects system

## Recommendation

The game client is fully functional and can receive feature updates. The request is to change the game name from "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe" to "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE". This is a simple text change in the title screen and HTML title.
