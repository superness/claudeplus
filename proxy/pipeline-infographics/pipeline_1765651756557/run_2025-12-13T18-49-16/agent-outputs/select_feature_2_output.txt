I can see this is a **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, not an RPG/adventure game with player characters, enemies, and combat. The user's request is to rename the game to "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE".

This is a **naming change request**, not a feature implementation request. The standard feature priority list (player character, map/world, collision, enemies, combat, etc.) doesn't apply to a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Next Feature: Game Name Change

### Already Implemented
- Complete Tic-Tac-Toe game with cosmic theme
- Two factions (Orbis and Crucia)
- Five AI difficulty levels
- Particle effects and animations
- Score tracking and resource systems (cosmic essence, orbs, shards)
- Title screen, game screen, and result overlay
- Current name: "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid"

### Why This Feature
The user explicitly requested renaming the game to "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE". This is a text/branding update, not a gameplay feature from the priority list. The game is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, so the RPG feature priority list doesn't apply.

The name change requires updating:
1. HTML `<title>` tag (line 6)
2. Title screen text (lines 19-21)
