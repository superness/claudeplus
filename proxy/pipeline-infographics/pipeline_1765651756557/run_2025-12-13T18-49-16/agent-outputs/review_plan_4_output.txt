I've now read the actual HTML and a key design doc. Let me verify the extracted requirements against what I found.

## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

1. **Current game name confirmed** - The HTML file at line 6 shows: `<title>Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe: The Eternal Grid</title>`

2. **Title screen structure verified** - Lines 18-22 show the title is displayed in three parts:
   - `h1.title-main`: "COSMIC"
   - `h2.title-sub`: "TIC-TAC-TOE"  
   - `p.title-subtitle`: "THE ETERNAL GRID"

3. **Design doc references accurate** - player-experience.md:1 shows "Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe" used throughout

4. **Implementation checklist is complete**:
   - HTML `<title>` tag (line 6) - needs update
   - Title screen heading text (lines 19-21) - needs update
   - Subtitle "THE ETERNAL GRID" (line 21) - should be removed per user request (new name doesn't include subtitle)

5. **Scope correctly identified** - This is a branding/text change only; no gameplay changes required

6. **ALL CAPS format noted** - User requested "SUPER COSMIC TIC-TAC-TOE" in uppercase, which should be preserved

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements accurately capture:
- The exact locations where the name appears
- The current name format (multiline title on screen, single line in `<title>`)
- The user's requested new name with ALL CAPS styling
- The minimal scope (text change only)

No red flags found - no generic placeholders, no missing specifications, and the implementation checklist covers all necessary file locations.
