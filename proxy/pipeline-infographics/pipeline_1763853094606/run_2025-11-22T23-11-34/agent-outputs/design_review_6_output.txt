ASSESSMENT:

**Strengths:**
- Clear understanding that this is a pipeline JSON creation task based on MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3
- Correctly identified all 7 stages in proper sequence with appropriate agent assignments
- Sensible approach: read spec document → examine existing templates → design structure → write file
- Recognition that cycle_integration_tester appears 3 times (stages 2, 5, 6) shows attention to detail
- Good plan to validate stage flow and dependencies
- Appropriate use of existing templates as reference for schema/conventions

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Evidence collection is incomplete** - While the plan mentions "will show" various items, it doesn't specify CONCRETE verification steps AFTER creating the file:
   - No mention of reading back the created JSON to verify it was written correctly
   - No JSON validation step (e.g., using `jq` or Python to verify valid JSON syntax)
   - No verification that the file exists at the correct path
   
2. **Missing validation criteria** - Doesn't specify what constitutes "success":
   - What specific fields MUST be present in the JSON?
   - What are the required properties for each stage definition?
   - How to verify agent routing is correctly configured?

3. **Dependency on external files** - Plan assumes MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and has section 3.3, but doesn't have a fallback if it's missing or incomplete

4. **No schema validation** - Doesn't mention checking if the pipeline JSON matches expected schema/format that the pipeline execution system requires

**Proposed Evidence is Vague:**
- "Will show the content from section 3.3" - This is research, not completion evidence
- "Will display examples from existing pipeline templates" - This is research, not completion evidence  
- "Will provide the complete JSON schema" - This is the work product, not verification
- "Will show the final JSON content before writing" - Good, but what about AFTER writing?

**Missing Concrete Verification Steps:**
- Read back the created file and display its contents
- Validate JSON syntax with `cat /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json | jq .`
- Confirm file size > 0 bytes
- Verify all 7 stage names appear in the file
- Verify all 4 agent types appear in the file

EVIDENCE_QUALITY: **Weak** - The proposed evidence focuses on intermediate research steps rather than final verification. No concrete post-creation validation steps are defined to PROVE the file was created correctly with all required components.

DECISION: **REJECTED**

**Reasoning:** While the approach is sound and shows good understanding, the plan lacks CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE evidence collection steps to prove task completion. It needs to add specific post-creation validation steps like:
- Reading back the created JSON file
- Validating JSON syntax with a tool
- Verifying presence of all 7 stages and 4 agent types
- Confirming the file exists at the specified path with content

The plan should specify EXACTLY what verification commands will be run and what output would constitute proof of success.
