UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-bug-fix pipeline based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should be a JSON file that defines 7 stages for fixing CoiniumServ bugs with reproduction via mining cycle, and will be written to /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications
2. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the JSON structure and format conventions
3. Design the JSON schema incorporating all 7 stages with proper routing between task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, and task_executor
4. Plan the specific configuration for each stage including inputs, outputs, and routing logic

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and locate section 3.3
2) Use Glob tool to find existing pipeline templates: pattern="*.json", path="/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates"
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the structure, schema, and conventions
4) Design the pool-bug-fix.json structure with:
   - Stage 1: analyze_bug (routes to task_planner)
   - Stage 2: reproduce_with_mining (routes to cycle_integration_tester)
   - Stage 3: verify_bug (routes to proof_validator)
   - Stage 4: implement_fix (routes to task_executor)
   - Stage 5: validate_with_cycle (routes to cycle_integration_tester)
   - Stage 6: regression_check (routes to cycle_integration_tester)
   - Stage 7: bug_fix_verified (END state)
5) Map out routing logic between stages including success/failure paths
6) Define input/output schemas for each stage
7) Plan to use Write tool to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Will verify the JSON structure matches existing pipeline templates
- Will ensure all 7 stages are properly defined with correct routing
- Will validate that stage transitions follow the specified flow (analyze→reproduce→verify→implement→validate→regression→verified)
- Will check that each stage routes to the correct specialized component (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
- Will ensure the pipeline handles both success and failure paths appropriately
- Will verify the final stage properly marks END state
- Will validate JSON syntax is correct and parseable

EVIDENCE:
- Will provide the actual section 3.3 content from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will show examples of existing pipeline JSON structure from templates directory
- Will demonstrate the complete pool-bug-fix.json structure with all 7 stages properly configured
- Will show the routing connections between stages match the specification
- Will confirm the file path /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json is correct

CONFIDENCE: Medium - I need to read the actual MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md section 3.3 to understand the specific requirements and see existing pipeline templates to match the expected JSON schema format. Without seeing these files first, I cannot guarantee the exact structure, but the overall approach of reading specifications, examining examples, and creating a conforming JSON file is straightforward.
