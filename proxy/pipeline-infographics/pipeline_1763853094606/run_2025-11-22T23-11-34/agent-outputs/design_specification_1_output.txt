UNDERSTANDING: I need to read section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand the pool-bug-fix pipeline specifications, then create a complete pipeline JSON file that implements a 7-stage bug fix workflow using mining cycle reproduction and validation.

APPROACH: First, locate and read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to extract section 3.3 specifications. Then, examine existing pipeline JSON files in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the expected JSON structure and format. Finally, create the pool-bug-fix.json file following the established pattern with the 7 stages specified (analyze_bug, reproduce_with_mining, verify_bug, implement_fix, validate_with_cycle, regression_check, bug_fix_verified).

STEPS:
1) Use Glob to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository: `pattern: "**/MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md"`
2) Use Read to read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file and locate section 3.3
3) Use Glob to find existing pipeline JSON files: `pattern: "/mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/*.json"`
4) Use Read to examine 2-3 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the structure (agent routing, stage definitions, transitions, context passing)
5) Analyze section 3.3 requirements for each stage: inputs, outputs, agent types, transition conditions
6) Map the 7 stages to appropriate agents (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
7) Design the JSON structure with proper stage sequencing and data flow
8) Define transition conditions between stages (success/failure paths)
9) Specify context variables that need to be passed between stages (bug report, reproduction steps, test results, fix implementation)
10) Use Write to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json with the complete pipeline definition

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will validate that each stage has clear inputs/outputs defined from section 3.3
- Will ensure proper agent routing matches the specification (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
- Will verify stage transitions handle both success and failure paths appropriately
- Will check that context variables flow correctly through all 7 stages
- Will ensure the final bug_fix_verified stage properly terminates the pipeline
- Will validate JSON syntax and structure matches existing pipeline templates
- Will consider edge cases: bugs that cannot be reproduced, fixes that fail validation, regression failures

EVIDENCE:
- The actual content of section 3.3 from MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing stage specifications
- Examples of existing pipeline JSON structure from /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/
- The complete pool-bug-fix.json file content showing all 7 stages properly configured
- Mapping document showing how each stage requirement maps to the JSON implementation
- Validation that agent types match the specified routing (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)

CONFIDENCE: Medium - This requires understanding existing pipeline architecture and section 3.3 specifications. Confidence depends on: 1) Whether MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and has detailed section 3.3, 2) Whether existing pipeline templates provide clear structure patterns, 3) Whether the agent routing specifications are clearly defined. If documentation is incomplete, may need to make reasonable assumptions based on the stage descriptions provided.
