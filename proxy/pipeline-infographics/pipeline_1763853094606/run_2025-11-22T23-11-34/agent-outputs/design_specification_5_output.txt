UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-bug-fix pipeline JSON file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline handles CoiniumServ bug fixes with mining cycle reproduction and has 7 defined stages with specific agent assignments.

APPROACH: 
1. First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications
2. Examine existing pipeline templates in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to understand the JSON structure and conventions
3. Design the JSON structure incorporating all 7 stages with proper agent routing and stage dependencies
4. Ensure the pipeline follows the established template patterns while incorporating mining cycle integration

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to read MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md and locate section 3.3 specifications
2) Use Bash tool to list existing pipeline templates: `ls -la /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/*.json`
3) Use Read tool to examine 2-3 existing pipeline JSON files to understand schema, structure, and conventions
4) Design the pool-bug-fix.json structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name, description, version)
   - Stage definitions for all 7 stages (analyze_bug, reproduce_with_mining, verify_bug, implement_fix, validate_with_cycle, regression_check, bug_fix_verified)
   - Agent routing (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester, proof_validator, task_executor)
   - Stage dependencies and flow control
   - Input/output specifications for each stage
   - Mining cycle integration parameters
5) Map out stage transitions and decision points
6) Define any required validation rules or constraints
7) Plan the Write tool usage to create /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/pool-bug-fix.json

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS:
- Verify all 7 stages are properly defined and sequenced
- Ensure agent assignments match requirements (task_planner, cycle_integration_tester appears 3 times, proof_validator, task_executor)
- Validate stage dependencies create proper flow: analyze_bug → reproduce_with_mining → verify_bug → implement_fix → validate_with_cycle → regression_check → bug_fix_verified
- Confirm mining cycle integration touchpoints are present in appropriate stages
- Check that END condition is properly defined for bug_fix_verified stage
- Verify JSON is valid and follows template conventions from existing pipelines

EVIDENCE:
- Will show the content from section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md
- Will display examples from existing pipeline templates showing structure
- Will provide the complete JSON schema with all stages, agents, and dependencies
- Will demonstrate stage flow matches the specified sequence
- Will show the final JSON content before writing to file

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - This is a structured task with clear requirements, but success depends on:
1. Section 3.3 existing in MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md with sufficient detail
2. Existing pipeline templates providing clear structural patterns
3. Understanding the specific integration points for mining cycle testing
The plan is solid, but implementation details may need adjustment based on actual file contents.
