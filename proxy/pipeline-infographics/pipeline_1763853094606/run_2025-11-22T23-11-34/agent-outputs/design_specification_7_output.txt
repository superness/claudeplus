UNDERSTANDING: User wants me to create a plan for building a pool-bug-fix pipeline JSON file based on section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md. The pipeline should handle CoiniumServ bug fixes with mining cycle reproduction, containing 7 specific stages with designated Claude instances.

APPROACH: First read the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file to understand section 3.3 specifications, then examine existing pipeline templates in the claudeplus/templates directory to understand the expected JSON structure and format. Use this information to create a detailed plan for constructing the pool-bug-fix.json file with all required stages, transitions, and metadata.

STEPS:
1) Use Read tool to examine /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ or search for MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to locate the planning document
2) Use Grep tool to find MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md in the repository if path is unknown
3) Use Read tool to read section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md to understand detailed specifications
4) Use Glob tool with pattern "*.json" in /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ to find existing pipeline templates
5) Use Read tool to examine 1-2 existing pipeline JSON files to understand the schema structure (stages, transitions, metadata format)
6) Design JSON structure with:
   - Pipeline metadata (name: "pool-bug-fix", description, version)
   - 7 stages array with stage definitions for: analyze_bug, reproduce_with_mining, verify_bug, implement_fix, validate_with_cycle, regression_check, bug_fix_verified
   - Each stage specifying: stage_id, instance_type (task_planner/cycle_integration_tester/proof_validator/task_executor), inputs, outputs, transitions
   - Transitions mapping stage flow according to the specified sequence
   - Any additional fields required based on existing templates (timeout, retry_policy, etc.)
7) Map out the complete stage transition graph ensuring proper flow from analyze_bug → END through all 7 stages
8) Verify directory /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists using ls command before planning write operation

TEST_CONSIDERATIONS: 
- Will verify the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md exists and section 3.3 contains the required specifications
- Will ensure pipeline JSON schema matches existing template patterns
- Will validate that all 7 stages are properly defined with correct instance types
- Will verify stage transitions create a valid directed graph from start to END
- Will check that cycle_integration_tester is used for stages 2, 5, and 6 as specified
- Will confirm proper input/output contracts between stages

EVIDENCE:
- Content from section 3.3 of MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md showing pipeline requirements
- Existing pipeline JSON template structure for schema reference
- Complete stage definitions showing instance type assignments matching user specifications
- Transition graph demonstrating valid flow: analyze_bug → reproduce_with_mining → verify_bug → implement_fix → validate_with_cycle → regression_check → bug_fix_verified → END
- Directory listing confirming /mnt/c/github/claudeplus/templates/ exists and is writable

CONFIDENCE: Medium-High - The pipeline structure is clearly defined with 7 stages and instance types specified. Confidence depends on finding the MINING_CYCLE_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md file and existing template examples to ensure proper JSON schema. If both sources exist with clear specifications, confidence rises to High. Lower confidence if template format needs to be inferred or section 3.3 specifications are ambiguous.
