## Review: APPROVED

### Verified Specifications

I have independently verified the design document against the implementation. The requirements extraction is accurate and complete:

**Board System** ✅
- Design: `(x + y) % 2 === 1` for dark squares
- Implementation: Line 43 `return (x + y) % 2 === 1;`

**Piece System** ✅
- Design: 12 pieces per player, red rows 0-2, black rows 5-7
- Implementation: Lines 105-116 with exact positions matching design doc

**Movement System** ✅
- Design: `Math.abs(dx) === 1 && Math.abs(dy) === 1`, direction constraints
- Implementation: Lines 153-173 with exact formula match

**Capture System** ✅
- Design: `Math.abs(dx) === 2 && Math.abs(dy) === 2`, mandatory capture, multi-jump
- Implementation: Lines 210-280 with mandatory capture enforcement in TurnSystem

**Turn System** ✅
- Design: Red first, alternating turns, multi-jump tracking
- Implementation: Lines 283-348 with `currentPlayer = 'red'` and multi-jump state

**King Promotion System** ✅
- Design: Red at y=7, black at y=0, promotion ends multi-jump
- Implementation: Lines 351-365 with exact row checks; multi-jump ended in GameController lines 696-704

**Win Condition System** ✅
- Design: No pieces, no moves, 80 half-moves (40 per player) draw rule
- Implementation: Lines 367-412 with `movesWithoutCapture >= 80`

**Input System** ✅
- Design: Click selection, move execution, highlight valid moves, mandatory capture enforcement
- Implementation: Lines 414-474

**Rendering System** ✅
- Design colors: Light #FFCE9E, Dark #D18B47, Red #C41E3A, Black #1C1C1C
- Implementation: CONFIG lines 10-15 with exact color palette match, crown rendering at lines 575-604

### Ready for Implementation

The requirements accurately capture the complete design document. All 9 systems are fully implemented with exact specifications including formulas, game rules, win/draw conditions, and visual styling per the design document.
