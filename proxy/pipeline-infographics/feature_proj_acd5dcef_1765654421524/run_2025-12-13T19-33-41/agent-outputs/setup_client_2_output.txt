## Summary

**What the user requested:** A checkers game - Build the "Basic Checker" game using the design documents provided.

**What I learned from the design docs:**
- American Checkers variant (8x8 board, 32 playable dark squares)
- 12 pieces per player (24 total)
- 9 complete systems specified: Board, Piece, Movement, Capture, Turn, King Promotion, Win Condition, Input, and Rendering
- Mandatory capture rule enforced
- Multi-jump continuation required
- Promotion ends multi-jump sequence
- Draw after 40 moves without capture
- Specific color palette defined (#FFCE9E light, #D18B47 dark, #C41E3A red, #1C1C1C black)

**Framework chosen:** Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- This is a 2D board game with no 3D references
- Canvas is ideal for simple 2D grid-based games
- No external dependencies needed for a checkers game
- Matches the design doc's rendering specifications exactly

**What I created:**
- `client/package.json` - Package configuration with serve script for local development
- `client/index.html` - Game entry point with UI elements (player panels, turn indicator, status messages, modals)
- `client/game.js` - Complete implementation of all 9 systems:
  1. **BoardSystem** - 8x8 grid, dark square validation, piece positioning
  2. **PieceSystem** - Piece creation, initial setup (12 per player), removal tracking
  3. **MovementSystem** - Diagonal move validation, direction enforcement
  4. **CaptureSystem** - Jump validation, mandatory captures, multi-jump detection
  5. **TurnSystem** - Turn alternation, multi-jump state, mandatory capture enforcement
  6. **KingPromotionSystem** - Promotion detection (row 7 for red, row 0 for black)
  7. **WinConditionSystem** - No pieces, no moves, 40-move draw rule
  8. **InputSystem** - Click handling, piece selection, valid move highlighting
  9. **RenderingSystem** - Board drawing, pieces with shadows/highlights, king crowns
- `client/style.css` - Modern styling with gradient backgrounds, active player highlighting, responsive design, game over modal
