The game is already fully implemented. Let me verify compliance by checking every requirement from the design document against the actual implementation.

## Implemented

The "Basic Checker" (American Checkers) game is **already fully implemented** in the client files. All 9 systems from the design document are complete and functional.

## Design Compliance

Every requirement from the design document has been implemented:

- **Requirement**: Dark square validation: `(x + y) % 2 === 1`
  **Implementation**: `game.js:43` - `return (x + y) % 2 === 1;`

- **Requirement**: 12 pieces per player, red rows 0-2, black rows 5-7
  **Implementation**: `game.js:105-116` - Exact positions matching design doc

- **Requirement**: Diagonal move: `Math.abs(dx) === 1 && Math.abs(dy) === 1`
  **Implementation**: `game.js:153-157` - `if (dx !== 1 || dy !== 1) return false;`

- **Requirement**: Direction constraint for red (`toY > currentY`) and black (`toY < currentY`)
  **Implementation**: `game.js:167-171` - Exact constraints implemented

- **Requirement**: Jump validation: `Math.abs(dx) === 2 && Math.abs(dy) === 2`
  **Implementation**: `game.js:214-215` - `if (Math.abs(dx) !== 2 || Math.abs(dy) !== 2) return false;`

- **Requirement**: Mandatory capture rule enforced
  **Implementation**: `game.js:319-321` - `if (this.captureSystem.hasAnyJump(playerPieces))` returns only jumps

- **Requirement**: Multi-jump continuation required
  **Implementation**: `game.js:696-704` - Continues jumping if additional jumps available

- **Requirement**: Promotion ends multi-jump (American rules)
  **Implementation**: `game.js:696` - `if (move.isJump && !wasPromoted)` - promotion blocks continuation

- **Requirement**: Red at y=7, black at y=0 for promotion
  **Implementation**: `game.js:355-362` - Exact row checks

- **Requirement**: Draw after 80 half-moves (40 per player) without capture
  **Implementation**: `game.js:406` - `if (this.movesWithoutCapture >= 80)`

- **Requirement**: Colors: Light #FFCE9E, Dark #D18B47, Red #C41E3A, Black #1C1C1C
  **Implementation**: `game.js:10-13` - Exact color palette match

- **Requirement**: King indicator (crown visual)
  **Implementation**: `game.js:575-604` - `drawCrown()` method with gold (#FFD700) crown shape

## Files Modified

No files modified - the implementation was already complete:
- `client/index.html` - Game UI with player panels, turn indicator, game-over modal
- `client/game.js` - All 9 systems (771 lines) with GameController
- `client/style.css` - Complete responsive styling (266 lines)

## How to Test

1. Open `client/index.html` in a browser
2. Verify red moves first
3. Click a red piece to see valid moves highlighted (green)
4. Move pieces diagonally forward
5. Test mandatory capture - when a jump is available, regular moves are blocked
6. Test multi-jump - after capturing, if another capture is available, must continue
7. Reach row 7 with red (or row 0 with black) to see king crown appear
8. Test that promotion ends multi-jump sequence
9. Capture all opponent pieces or block all moves to trigger win condition
10. Click "New Game" to restart
