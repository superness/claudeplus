## Current State
- **Client exists**: No - there are no index.html, game.js, or any JavaScript/HTML/CSS files
- **Design docs**: `design-docs/game-design.md` - A comprehensive American Checkers design document with full system specifications including Board, Piece, Movement, Capture, Turn, King Promotion, Win Condition, Input, and Rendering systems
- **Backend code**: None - no src/ folder, no client/ folder, no code files exist
- **Can run**: No - no package.json, no executable code exists

## Recommendation
The project has an excellent, detailed design document but **no game client exists at all**. We need to set up the complete game client from scratch before any features can be implemented. This includes:
- Creating the HTML structure
- Setting up the canvas/rendering 
- Implementing all 9 game systems from the design doc
- Adding the game loop and input handling
