## Feature: Game Complete - All Features Implemented

### Design Documentation Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Based on examination of the design document (`design-docs/game-design.md`) and the implementation (`client/game.js`), **ALL 9 systems specified in the design document have been fully implemented**.

### Specifications from Design Docs - ALL VERIFIED AS IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Board System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "8x8 grid with alternating dark/light squares...Only dark squares (32 total) are playable...Dark square validation: `(x + y) % 2 === 1`"

**Implementation:** `BoardSystem` class (lines 21-78) - `isDarkSquare(x, y) { return (x + y) % 2 === 1; }`

#### 2. Piece System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "12 pieces per player (24 total)...red (starts bottom, rows 0-2) and black (starts top, rows 5-7)"

**Implementation:** `PieceSystem` class (lines 80-144) with exact initial positions matching spec

#### 3. Movement System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Diagonal validation: `Math.abs(targetX - currentX) === 1 && Math.abs(targetY - currentY) === 1`...Red: `targetY > currentY`...Black: `targetY < currentY`"

**Implementation:** `MovementSystem` class (lines 146-202) - exact formula match

#### 4. Capture System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Jump validation: `Math.abs(dx) === 2 && Math.abs(dy) === 2`...Mandatory capture...Multi-jump continuation"

**Implementation:** `CaptureSystem` class (lines 204-281) with mandatory capture and multi-jump

#### 5. Turn System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Red always moves first...Turns alternate...During multi-jump, only the jumping piece can move"

**Implementation:** `TurnSystem` class (lines 283-348) - `currentPlayer = 'red'`, multi-jump tracking

#### 6. King Promotion System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Red piece reaching row 7 becomes king...Black piece reaching row 0 becomes king...If promoted during multi-jump, turn ends"

**Implementation:** `KingPromotionSystem` class (lines 350-365) - exact row checks

#### 7. Win Condition System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Win: opponent has no pieces remaining...Win: opponent has no legal moves...Draw: 40 consecutive moves without capture (80 half-moves)"

**Implementation:** `WinConditionSystem` class (lines 367-412) - `movesWithoutCapture >= 80`

#### 8. Input System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Click to select piece...Click destination to move...Highlight valid moves...Enforce mandatory captures"

**Implementation:** `InputSystem` class (lines 414-474)

#### 9. Rendering System ✅
**Design doc specifies:**
> "Draw 8x8 board...Render pieces...Indicate kings (crown)...Highlight selected piece...Color palette: Light #FFCE9E, Dark #D18B47, Red #C41E3A, Black #1C1C1C"

**Implementation:** `RenderingSystem` class (lines 476-605) with exact color palette match in CONFIG

### Implementation Checklist - ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Board System - 8x8 grid, dark square validation
- [x] Piece System - 12 pieces per player, initial positions
- [x] Movement System - diagonal moves, direction enforcement
- [x] Capture System - jumps, mandatory captures, multi-jump
- [x] Turn System - alternation, multi-jump state
- [x] King Promotion System - row 7/0 promotion, ends multi-jump
- [x] Win Condition System - no pieces, no moves, 40-move draw
- [x] Input System - selection, highlighting, move execution
- [x] Rendering System - board, pieces, crowns, colors per spec
- [x] UI - turn indicators, captured counts, game over modal
- [x] Game controller orchestrating all systems

### Conclusion

The game is **100% complete** per the design document. All 9 systems are implemented with exact specifications including:
- All formulas match (`(x + y) % 2 === 1`, diagonal checks, jump validation)
- All game rules implemented (mandatory capture, multi-jump, promotion ends jump sequence)
- All win/draw conditions (no pieces, no moves, 80 half-moves)
- Exact color palette from design doc
- Complete UI with turn indicators, captured counts, game over modal

**No additional features remain to be implemented.**
