## Feature Complete: Basic Checker Game

### What Was Built
A fully-functional American Checkers (8x8) two-player board game implementing all 9 systems defined in the game design document:

1. **Board System** - 8x8 grid with dark square validation using `(x + y) % 2 === 1`
2. **Piece System** - 12 pieces per player, proper initial positioning (red rows 0-2, black rows 5-7)
3. **Movement System** - Diagonal movement by 1 with direction enforcement
4. **Capture System** - Jump capture with mandatory capture rule and multi-jump continuation
5. **Turn System** - Red starts first, alternating turns, multi-jump tracking
6. **King Promotion System** - Red promotes at y=7, black at y=0, promotion ends multi-jump
7. **Win Condition System** - Win by capturing all pieces or blocking moves, 40-move draw rule
8. **Input System** - Click to select/move with valid move highlighting
9. **Rendering System** - Canvas-based rendering with correct color palette

### Next Steps
The user's original request was: **"A checkers game"**

**Assessment of completeness:**
- ✅ 8x8 board with proper visuals
- ✅ 12 pieces per player in starting positions
- ✅ Diagonal movement for regular pieces
- ✅ Jump captures with mandatory capture rule
- ✅ Multi-jump sequences
- ✅ King promotion when reaching opposite end
- ✅ Kings can move/jump both directions
- ✅ Win detection (no pieces, no moves, 40-move draw)
- ✅ Turn-based two-player gameplay
- ✅ Visual feedback (selection, valid moves highlighted)
- ✅ Game over modal with winner/reason
- ✅ New Game button to restart

The game is **fully playable** and implements all standard American Checkers rules. Two human players can play a complete game from start to finish. This matches the user's vision of "a checkers game" completely.
