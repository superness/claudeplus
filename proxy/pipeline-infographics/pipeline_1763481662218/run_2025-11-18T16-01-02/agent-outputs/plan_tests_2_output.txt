Perfect! I've created a comprehensive test plan and executable test script for the persistent ship fitting feature.

## Test Plan Summary

I've created a complete test plan covering 8 test cases (TC-001 through TC-008) that validate:

**Core Persistence (TC-001, TC-002, TC-003)**
- Single module persistence across reload
- Module removal persistence across reload
- Multiple modules persistence across reload

**Error Handling (TC-004, TC-005)**
- Graceful handling of corrupted localStorage (invalid JSON)
- Graceful handling of missing localStorage (first load)

**Synchronous Save Validation (TC-006, TC-007)**
- Immediate localStorage update on fit action (no delay)
- Immediate localStorage update on remove action (no delay)

**Data Integrity (TC-008)**
- Slot positions (slotType and slotIndex) preserved correctly

## Test Script: `test_ship_fitting_persistence.js`

I've written the actual executable test script using ChromeManager that:

✅ **Uses ChromeManager** for Chrome lifecycle (automatic launch, console log capture, process management)
✅ **Defines test scenario** in `defineScenario()` function with 39 test steps
✅ **Connects to WebSocket** automation endpoint (ws://localhost:8765)
✅ **Executes commands** with verification for each step
✅ **Collects console logs** automatically via ChromeManager
✅ **Generates evidence file** with all test results and console data
✅ **Provides clear output** with pass/fail status for each test case
✅ **Exits with proper codes** (0 = all passed, 1 = failure)

## How to Run

```bash
node test_ship_fitting_persistence.js
```

The test will:
1. Launch Chrome with the game
2. Execute all 8 test cases (39 individual steps)
3. Save evidence to JSON file with timestamp
4. Display summary with pass/fail counts and console error counts
5. Exit with appropriate code
