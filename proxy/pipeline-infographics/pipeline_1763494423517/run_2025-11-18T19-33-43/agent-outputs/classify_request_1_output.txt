This is clearly a **BUG_FIX** request. The user has identified two specific broken functionalities:

1. **WebSocket Disconnect Bug**: A critical connection failure (error 1006) occurring after the teleport/setPosition command
2. **Ship Fitting UI Bug**: A TypeError preventing items from being fitted via double-click, with undefined 'hull' property error

Both bugs have:
- Specific error messages and codes
- Clear reproduction steps
- Identified failure points in the codebase
- Request for investigation, fixing, and validation

The request explicitly asks to "investigate and fix" these "critical bugs," making this unambiguously a bug fix task.

**DECISION: BUG_FIX**
