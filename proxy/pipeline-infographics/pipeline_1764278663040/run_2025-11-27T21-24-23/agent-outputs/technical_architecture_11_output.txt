I've created the comprehensive technical architecture document for MineBox at `business-plan/technical/01-technical-architecture.md`. 

The document covers:

**Technical Vision**: Constraint-driven design for Pi 5, trust-through-verification philosophy, and mining-first architecture

**System Architecture**: Detailed component breakdown including:
- User interface layer (Web dashboard, REST API, CLI)
- Application core (Stratum server, block template generator, snapshot manager)
- Daemon orchestration (multi-coin management, RPC abstraction)
- Infrastructure (SQLite, Redis, Prometheus metrics)

**Technology Stack**: Go/Rust backend (for Pi performance), React/Vue frontend, SQLite for zero-config deployment, with rationale for each choice

**Technical Requirements**: 
- Performance targets (<30 min sync, <50ms share latency)
- Scalability (10+ coins, 50+ miners)
- Security (cryptographic snapshot verification, API auth)
- Reliability (99.5% uptime SLA)

**Development Approach**: Agile with open-source adaptations, testing pyramid, three deployment modes (Pi image for Sarah, Docker for Marcus, source build for Viktor)

**Technical Milestones**: 
- MVP in 3 months (single coin)
- Multi-coin v0.5 in 2 more months
- v1.0 release at month 7
- v2.0 platform at month 14

**Risks & Mitigations**: Addressed snapshot trust rejection, Pi performance limits, altcoin instability, and supply chain attacks

**Build vs. Buy**: Build stratum server and verification in-house; buy CDN and use OSS monitoring

The architecture aligns with the thesis ($50K MRR via snapshot services) and supports all four personas from the customer analysis.
