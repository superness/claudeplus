I've created a comprehensive legal and compliance analysis document for MineBox. The document covers:

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Business Structure**: Recommends Delaware C-Corp for investor flexibility, with Wyoming LLC as a bootstrapped alternative

2. **Critical Regulatory Analysis**:
   - Money transmission analysis concluding MineBox is likely NOT an MSB (architecture avoids custody/transmission)
   - Recommends obtaining formal legal opinion ($5-10K) to document this position
   - BitLicense avoidance strategy for NY

3. **Data Privacy**: GDPR and CCPA compliance requirements with specific data handling tables

4. **IP Strategy**: 
   - MIT license recommended for open-source core
   - Trademark filing prioritized (MineBox word + logo)
   - Patents de-prioritized due to cost/open-source tension

5. **Contracts Needed**: ToS with crypto-specific provisions, Privacy Policy, PIIA for employees, CLA for contributors

6. **Risk Assessment**: Detailed matrix with probability/impact ratings and mitigations for regulatory, IP, liability, and tax risks

7. **Insurance**: E&O, cyber liability, and D&O coverage recommendations with budget estimates ($5-8K Year 1 growing to $25-35K Year 5)

8. **Legal Budget**: $15-35K Year 1, with cost-saving strategies outlined

9. **Compliance Roadmap**: Prioritized checklist with owners and deadlines
