I have created the comprehensive MineBox Team & Culture Plan. Here's a summary of the key elements:

## Team & Culture Plan Summary

**Team Vision**: "Small team, big leverage" - a senior-heavy, remote-first team that leverages open-source community contributions to outperform larger teams.

**Key Highlights**:

1. **Founding Team**: Single founder (engineering-focused) with contractor support pre-launch. No immediate hires required, validating product-market fit first.

2. **Hiring Plan**: Grows from 1 FTE to 11 FTEs over 5 years
   - First critical hire: Senior Backend Engineer at $5K MRR (Month 8-10)
   - MRR-triggered hiring (not calendar-driven)
   - Part-time roles test fit before full-time commitment

3. **Key Role Profiles**: Detailed profiles for:
   - Senior Backend Engineer (first hire, most critical)
   - DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer
   - Developer Relations
   - Customer Success (technical)

4. **Recruiting Strategy**: 
   - Priority: Referrals → Open-source contributors → Crypto job boards
   - 4-stage interview process with compensated take-home project
   - Target 50th-75th percentile compensation

5. **Core Values** (5):
   - User Sovereignty
   - Radical Transparency
   - Ship Relentlessly
   - Community First
   - Own the Outcome

6. **Compensation Philosophy**:
   - Market-rate salaries with meaningful equity (1-2% for first hires)
   - Location-adjusted tiers for international
   - Standard benefits + remote work stipend

7. **Remote/Office Strategy**: Fully remote, async-first with annual team retreats

8. **Talent Development**: Continuous feedback model, dual-track career progression (IC and management)
