I have created the comprehensive MineBox Operations Plan. Here's a summary of the key elements:

## Operations Plan Summary

**Operational Philosophy**: Lean, remote-first, community-leveraged model optimized for capital efficiency and open-source ethos.

**Key Highlights**:

1. **Headcount Plan**: Grows from 1 FTE (founder) to 11 FTEs over 5 years
   - Engineering-heavy (6 of 11 FTEs by Year 5)
   - No traditional sales team (product-led growth)
   - Customer Success scales with subscriber base

2. **Organizational Structure**: Flat hierarchy with founder as engineering-focused CEO
   - Direct reports until ~10 FTEs
   - Functional leads introduced at Year 5

3. **Key Processes**:
   - Product-led customer acquisition (no outbound sales)
   - Community-first support model (70% tier-1 handled by community)
   - Bi-weekly agile sprints with open-source community integration

4. **Infrastructure**: Fully remote, async-first with modern SaaS tooling stack

5. **Partnerships**: Hardware manufacturers, content creators, and potential node platform integrations

6. **Risk Management**: Multi-vendor strategy, documented incident response, business continuity planning

7. **Operational Metrics**: Focused on infrastructure uptime (99.9%), customer activation (>80% completion), and support quality (<24h response)

The plan aligns with the financial projections showing operations costs decreasing from 101% of revenue in Year 1 to 43% by Year 5.
