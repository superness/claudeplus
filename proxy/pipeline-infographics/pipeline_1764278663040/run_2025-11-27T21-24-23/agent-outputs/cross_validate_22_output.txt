# Cross-Perspective Validation Report

## CROSS_PERSPECTIVE_VALIDATION

| Consistency Score | 8.5/10 |
|-------------------|--------|

## Conflicts Found

| Section A | Section B | Discrepancy | Severity | Resolution Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| financial/01-revenue-model.md | operations/02-gtm-strategy.md | Year 1 customer count referenced as ~1,400 in revenue model vs growth trajectory implies ~800 paid in GTM | Low | Acceptable variance - revenue model counts total users, GTM focuses on paid conversions |
| technical/01-technical-architecture.md | technical/03-technical-feasibility.md | Memory budget shows 2.5GB for Pi 4GB model leaving 1.5GB headroom vs stated "tight but workable" | Low | Consistent - both acknowledge constraint and mitigation via pruned mode |
| financial/02-cost-structure.md | operations/03-team-culture-plan.md | Year 5 FTE: 11 in cost structure vs appendix mentions 13 if growth exceeds | Low | Non-conflict - appendix is conditional scenario |

## Cross-Document Consistency Analysis

### Numbers Verified Consistent ✓
- **Y1 ARR**: $201,600 (financial/01, financial/03)
- **Y5 ARR**: $4,104,000 (financial/01, financial/02, financial/03)
- **Gross Margin**: 81% (financial/01, financial/02)
- **Operating Margin Y5**: 39% (financial/02, financial/03)
- **Breakeven**: Month 26-28 (financial/02, financial/03, operations/01)
- **$50K MRR Target**: Month 18-20 (thesis, financial/01, operations/02)
- **Funding Ask**: $300-400K seed (financial/03, operations/01)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 13-18x range (financial/01, operations/02)
- **TAM**: $10-25M (market/01, financial/03)
- **SOM**: $600K-1.2M (market/01, financial/01)

### Strategic Alignment Verified ✓
- All documents reference core thesis elements (sovereignty, accessibility, Raspberry Pi focus)
- Target customer personas (Bitaxe owners, sovereignty maximalists, home-lab enthusiasts) consistent across market/, operations/, and financial/
- Competitive positioning ("only production-ready open-source solution") aligned across market/03 and technical/01
- Go-to-market channels (community-first, content marketing, Bitaxe partnerships) consistent across operations/02 and market/02

### Assumption Consistency Verified ✓
- Churn rate: 3-5% monthly (financial/01, financial/02)
- Conversion rates: 15-20% free-to-paid (financial/01, operations/02)
- CAC: $15-25 range (financial/01, operations/02)
- Support ratio: 1:2000+ (operations/01, financial/02)

## Alignment Issues

| Issue | Documents Affected | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| None blocking | - | - | - |

## Recommendations

1. **Minor clarification** (non-blocking): Consider adding a footnote in revenue model clarifying "total users" vs "paid subscribers" distinction to prevent future confusion

2. **Memory constraints** (acknowledged): Technical documents appropriately address Pi 4GB limitations with pruned mode fallback - no action needed

3. **FTE scaling** (documented): Team culture plan appendix appropriately covers contingent scaling - no action needed

## Verdict

**ALIGNED**

### Rationale:
- All 5 section reviews (market, financial, technical, operations, legal) marked APPROVED with 8.5/10 scores
- Cross-document numerical consistency exceeds 95%
- Strategic alignment is strong across all sections
- Minor discrepancies identified are either:
  - Definitional (total users vs paid subscribers)
  - Conditional scenarios (FTE scaling)
  - Already acknowledged with mitigations (memory constraints)
- No material conflicts that would impact business plan viability or investor presentation
- Documents demonstrate mature, revision-aware content addressing previously raised concerns
