Now I have the complete context. Let me provide my technical documentation review.

# MineBox Technical Documentation Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

This is a well-crafted, comprehensive technical documentation suite that demonstrates deep understanding of both the technical challenges and the target market. The documents are cohesive, mutually reinforcing, and strategically aligned with the business thesis.

---

## Strengths

### Technical Architecture (01-technical-architecture.md)
- **Constraint-driven design philosophy** is excellent—optimizing for Pi 5 rather than abstract scalability shows mature product thinking
- **Trust-through-verification approach** directly addresses the core thesis challenge around snapshot acceptance
- **Clear component responsibility separation** with well-defined integration points
- **Snapshot verification technical specification** (4-layer approach) is thorough and technically sound
- **Technology stack rationale** is well-justified (Go/Rust over Node.js for ARM performance)

### Product Roadmap (02-product-roadmap.md)
- **Phased approach** (MVP → Multi-Coin → Production → Platform) is realistic and appropriately scoped
- **Explicit MVP exclusions** prevent scope creep
- **Clear success criteria** with measurable metrics at each phase
- **RICE-based prioritization** with sovereignty alignment multiplier is a thoughtful adaptation
- **Competitive feature comparison** identifies clear differentiation opportunities

### Technical Feasibility (03-technical-feasibility.md)
- **Honest confidence assessment** (75% Medium-High) demonstrates intellectual honesty
- **Detailed assumption validation** with supporting evidence and risk levels
- **Specific POC activities** with clear success criteria enable de-risking
- **Technical debt acknowledgment** with repayment timeline is mature planning
- **Go/No-Go framework** with explicit red flags protects against overcommitment

## Technical Concerns

### 1. Memory Budget Tension
The architecture claims 512MB for core services, but multi-daemon targets may be optimistic:
- Bitcoin Core pruned: 300-600MB (document states)
- 3 altcoin daemons: 200-400MB each (600-1200MB total)
- MineBox services: 512MB
- **Total: 1.4-2.3GB** before OS overhead

**Concern**: The 4GB Pi 5 recommendation for multi-coin may be under-specified. Documents acknowledge this but don't fully reconcile.

### 2. Snapshot Trust—Unvalidated Core Assumption
The feasibility document rates community snapshot acceptance at only 55-60% confidence. This is the **single biggest risk** to the business model ($50K MRR depends on snapshot subscriptions), yet:
- No validation timeline for the community survey mentioned in de-risking activities
- Federated verification is deferred to v2.0, but this could accelerate trust-building

### 3. Stratum v2 Timeline
Stratum v2 is positioned for v2.0 (Month 14+), but:
- Bitaxe community may expect Stratum v2 support sooner
- Braiins (Stratum v2 reference implementation) has momentum
- Could become competitive disadvantage if delayed too long

### 4. Security Audit Scope Undefined
External security audit is budgeted for v1.0 but:
- No specific scope defined (stratum code? snapshot verification? full stack?)
- No budget range mentioned
- Timeline (Month 5-6) is tight if findings require significant rework

---

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Reconcile memory budgets explicitly**: Add a clear table showing actual memory scenarios for 1-coin, 3-coin, and 5-coin deployments with recommended Pi 5 RAM (4GB vs 8GB) for each.

2. **Elevate snapshot trust validation**: Move the community survey from "de-risking activity" to a **gated milestone** before v0.5 investment. If acceptance is <50%, this fundamentally changes the product strategy.

3. **Define security audit scope and budget**: Add a subsection to technical feasibility specifying:
   - Audit scope (stratum server, snapshot verification, API authentication)
   - Estimated cost range ($10-30K for crypto-focused auditors)
   - Contingency timeline if findings require architectural changes

4. **Add Stratum v2 monitoring milestone**: Include a checkpoint at v1.0 to assess Stratum v2 adoption in the Bitaxe ecosystem and decide whether to accelerate v2 support.

5. **Clarify daemon hibernation mechanism**: The "daemon hibernation" mitigation for memory pressure is mentioned but not specified. Add a brief technical description of how inactive daemons are stopped/resumed without user intervention.

## Verdict

**APPROVED**

The technical documentation suite is comprehensive, well-reasoned, and strategically aligned with the MineBox thesis. The concerns identified are manageable and represent normal engineering risks rather than fundamental feasibility blockers. The Go/No-Go framework with explicit red flags demonstrates appropriate risk awareness.

The documents provide a solid foundation for operational planning. The requested revisions are enhancements rather than critical deficiencies—they should be addressed during implementation rather than blocking approval.

**Key conditions already embedded in the documents**:
- POC validation gates before full development commitment
- External security review requirement before v1.0
- Honest hardware requirements communication
- Full-sync alternative for snapshot skeptics

These conditions adequately address the technical risks identified.
