Now I have all the documents. Let me review them against the criteria and the thesis.

## Market Analysis Review

### Overall Score: 8.5/10

### Strengths

**Completeness (30%) - Score: 28/30**
- All required sections present: Market overview, segmentation, competitive landscape, trends, entry analysis
- Market sizing includes TAM/SAM/SOM with clear methodology
- Multiple competitor categories analyzed (10+ competitors profiled across node platforms, legacy software, and commercial pools)
- Four detailed customer personas developed with rich psychographic detail

**Data Quality (25%) - Score: 21/25**
- Market size figures are reasonable and grounded ($10-25M TAM, $600K-1.2M SOM)
- SHA256 altcoin viability table provides concrete expected block times
- Clear acknowledgment of evidence gaps with prioritized validation checklist
- Revenue alignment section explicitly connects analysis to $50K MRR target

**Strategic Coherence (25%) - Score: 23/25**
- Analysis strongly aligns with the thesis refinement document
- Multi-coin differentiation strategy is clearly articulated throughout
- Competitive positioning map shows clear white space
- Business model logic flows naturally from market analysis

**Actionability (20%) - Score: 18/20**
- Segment prioritization provides clear go-to-market guidance
- Competitive response scenarios with specific defensive tactics
- Evidence requirements section outlines concrete validation steps
- Customer journey maps identify specific friction points and moments of truth

### Gaps Identified

1. **International market consideration**: Wei persona mentioned in pricing but not fully developed (minor - other personas are sufficient for MVP)

2. **Quantitative validation**: Some estimates are ranges without supporting methodology (e.g., "10,000-25,000 Bitaxe owners globally" - acknowledged in evidence requirements section)

3. **Revenue model connection in personas**: The $50K MRR target is mentioned but specific conversion paths could be more explicit in each persona's journey (addressed in cross-persona analysis table)

### Specific Revisions Required

None critical. The following are minor improvements for future iterations:

1. ~~Add explicit conversion funnel assumptions to each persona~~ - Already addressed in Cross-Persona Analysis section with population estimates and revenue potential table
2. ~~Include more specific competitor revenue/funding data where available~~ - Included for key competitors (Umbrel $3M seed, Start9 $1.2M seed)
3. Consider adding sensitivity analysis for market sizing scenarios - Present in the market sizing table with conservative/moderate/optimistic scenarios

### Verdict

**APPROVED**: The market analysis documents meet quality standards for proceeding to the financial phase.

**Rationale:**
- All three documents (market analysis, customer personas, competitive analysis) are comprehensive and professionally structured
- The documents demonstrate strong alignment with the thesis refinement document
- Market sizing is grounded with clear assumptions and appropriate acknowledgment of uncertainty
- Competitive landscape accurately identifies the blue ocean opportunity
- Customer personas are actionable and support product/marketing decisions
- Evidence requirements section shows intellectual honesty about validation gaps
- Revenue target ($50K MRR) is explicitly connected to market analysis with plausible customer acquisition targets (~3,250 customers at ~$18 blended rate)

The documents provide a solid foundation for financial modeling and product development. Minor gaps can be addressed during execution rather than blocking progress.
