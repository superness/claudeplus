I've created a comprehensive GTM strategy for MineBox at `business-plan/operations/02-gtm-strategy.md`. Here's a summary of the key elements:

**GTM Strategy Overview:**
- Community-first, product-led growth philosophy aligned with crypto community values
- Beachhead strategy targeting Bitaxe owners first (~10,000-25,000 users), then expanding to sovereignty maximalists, home-lab enthusiasts, and content creators
- Launch timeline spanning pre-launch beta (3 months), launch week activities, and post-launch optimization

**Positioning & Messaging:**
- Brand positioning: "Minutes, not days" sync time with full sovereignty
- Four messaging pillars: Time savings, sovereignty, multi-coin capability, and trust/transparency
- Persona-specific messaging for Sarah, Viktor, Marcus, and Alex

**Channel Strategy:**
- 70% effort on community engagement and content/SEO (low CAC)
- 20% on content creator partnerships and hardware ecosystem
- 10% experimental (paid advertising, events)
- Expected blended CAC: $15-20

**Launch Plan:**
- Pre-launch: 50-user beta program, documentation site, community seeding
- Launch week: Product Hunt, Hacker News, content creator videos, Reddit engagement
- Post-launch: Rapid iteration, feedback collection, multi-coin release (v0.5)

**Sales Strategy:**
- Product-led growth model (no traditional sales team)
- Self-serve tiers: Free, Starter ($10/mo), Pro ($25/mo)
- Enterprise handled by founder (inbound only, >$100/month)

**Partnership Strategy:**
- Hardware manufacturers (Bitaxe, Pi retailers)
- Content creators (VoskCoin, BTC Sessions)
- Affiliate program: 20% of first-year revenue

**GTM Metrics:**
- Launch week targets: 500+ downloads, 100+ active mining sessions, 30+ paying subscribers
- Month 12 targets: $20K MRR, 800 downloads/month, 80% activation rate
- Year 1 GTM budget: $64K (32% of revenue)
