I have created the executive summary document. Let me provide a summary of what was created:

## Executive Summary Created

I've synthesized all 17 business plan documents into a comprehensive executive summary at `business-plan/01-executive-summary.md`.

**Key highlights captured:**

**The Opportunity**
- $12-15M TAM in hobbyist mining infrastructure
- 50,000-100,000 potential users with hardware but no software
- Legacy pool software (MPOS, NOMP, CoiniumServ) is abandoned
- Node platforms (Umbrel, Start9) don't focus on mining

**The Solution**
- Snapshot sync: Days to minutes (25 min vs 3+ days)
- Multi-coin SHA256 support for realistic solo mining
- Raspberry Pi 5 optimized deployment
- Open-source core with paid infrastructure services

**Financial Projections**
- Year 1: $202K ARR, 1,200 customers
- Year 3: $1.53M ARR, 7,500 customers  
- Year 5: $4.1M ARR, 18,000 customers, 39% operating margin

**Unit Economics**
- LTV:CAC: 14-18x (industry avg: 3-5x)
- CAC Payback: 1.2-1.8 months
- Gross Margin: 80-86%

**The Ask**
- $300K-$400K seed round (targeting $350K)
- Single round to profitability (Month 27 breakeven)
- Expected investor returns: 11-14x MOIC, 55-70% IRR
