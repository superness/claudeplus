2. business-plan/timelines/quarterly-roadmap.md

When complete, end with:
DECISION: timelines_complete

=== ROUTING DECISION REQUIRED ===
After your response, you MUST choose exactly ONE decision from:
- timelines_complete: Timelines generated, write executive summary

**CRITICAL**: Your VERY LAST LINE must be exactly:
DECISION: [ONE_OF_THE_ABOVE_CHOICES]
Example: DECISION: timelines_complete
Do NOT add explanations after the decision keyword.
