I've successfully created a comprehensive customer personas document with four detailed personas. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Customer Personas Created

**1. Sarah Chen - The Bitaxe Tinkerer (Primary)**

- High technical proficiency, moderate price sensitivity
- Key pain: Failed node syncs, pool dependency, documentation rot
- Conversion target: 2,500 users at $15/month = $37,500/month

**2. Viktor Lindqvist - The Sovereignty Maximalist**
- 41-year-old security engineer in Stockholm
- Expert technical skills, demands cryptographic verification
- Key pain: Trusted third parties, lack of verification mechanisms
- Conversion target: 300 users at $40/month = $12,000/month

**3. Marcus Webb - The Home-Lab Enthusiast**

**Revenue Alignment:** The personas together support the $50K MRR target with ~3,250 paying customers across segments.

The document includes detailed demographics, psychographics, behavioral patterns, customer journeys with friction points and moments of delight, representative quotes, and day-in-the-life scenarios for each persona.
