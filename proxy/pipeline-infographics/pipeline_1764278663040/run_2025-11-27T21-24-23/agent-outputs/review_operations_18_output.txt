Now I have read all three operations documents. Let me provide my review.

# MineBox Operations Documentation Review

## Overall Score: 8.5/10

This is a **high-quality, well-structured operations plan** for an early-stage bootstrapped software company. The documents demonstrate thoughtful planning with clear alignment between operational philosophy, GTM strategy, and team culture.

---

## Strengths

### Completeness ✓
- **Org structure clearly defined**: Progressive organizational chart from solo founder through 11 FTEs by Year 5, with appropriate evolution (flat → functional leads)
- **Hiring plan is comprehensive**: MRR-triggered hires rather than calendar-driven, with specific role profiles, compensation ranges, and sourcing strategies
- **GTM strategy is actionable**: Beachhead strategy (Bitaxe owners), channel prioritization, launch playbooks, and specific success metrics

### Strategic Alignment ✓
- **Operations supports business goals**: Lean model (1 FTE → 11 FTEs) aligns with bootstrapped capital efficiency
- **GTM aligned with market**: Community-first approach matches crypto community's distrust of traditional marketing
- **Culture aligned with values**: "User Sovereignty" and "Radical Transparency" reinforce open-source product ethos
- **Metrics connected to financial model**: Operations costs decreasing from 101% → 43% of revenue matches cost structure projections

### Feasibility ✓
- **Headcount projections realistic**: 18,000 customers with 11 FTEs (~1,600:1 ratio) is aggressive but achievable with community support model
- **Timeline is staged appropriately**: Part-time roles before full-time, contractor validation before hires
- **Resource assumptions valid**: Tooling costs ($200-$2,000/month), CDN infrastructure, remote work stipends all reasonable

### Actionability ✓
- **Clear ownership**: Founder owns everything Year 1, then responsibilities clearly delegated
- **Metrics defined throughout**: Uptime targets, churn rates, CAC, activation rates, NPS all specified
- **Playbooks included**: GTM playbooks for community launch, creator outreach, block celebrations

## Operational Concerns

### 1. Key Person Risk (Acknowledged but High)
The documents acknowledge founder dependency but mitigation is weak. Year 1-2 has a single point of failure. The "documentation and cross-training" mitigation only works if there's someone to cross-train.

### 2. Community Support Model Assumptions
The plan assumes 70% of tier-1 support handled by community by Year 3. This is optimistic—crypto communities can be helpful but also unpredictable. If community support doesn't materialize, the lean headcount model breaks.

### 3. No Sales → Enterprise Inbound Only
The plan explicitly has no sales team and relies entirely on inbound for enterprise. This may limit growth ceiling. However, for a bootstrapped company with $25/month ARPU, this is a reasonable trade-off.

### 4. International Considerations Light
Location-adjusted compensation mentioned but no detail on Employer of Record costs, international tax implications, or specific geographic hiring strategy.

## Specific Revisions Required

1. **Add contingency for community support failure**: Include a fallback plan if community support doesn't reach 70% target (e.g., earlier CS hire, automated support tooling investment)

2. **Clarify Employer of Record approach**: Add 1-2 sentences specifying which EOR service (Deel, Remote, etc.) and budget implications for international hires

3. **Minor: Hiring timeline inconsistency**: Appendix shows Year 5 extending to 13.0 FTEs but main text targets 11 FTEs—clarify which is correct

These are minor items that don't fundamentally compromise the plan's executability.

---

## Verdict

**APPROVED**: The operations plan is comprehensive, realistic for a bootstrapped B2C SaaS, and executable by a technical founder. The documents demonstrate clear thinking about lean operations, community leverage, and staged growth. Minor gaps (international EOR, community support contingency) are reasonable for this planning stage and can be refined during execution.

The plan appropriately balances ambition (18K customers by Year 5) with pragmatism (MRR-triggered hiring, no premature scaling). The integration between ops plan, GTM strategy, and team culture is strong.

DECISION: approved
