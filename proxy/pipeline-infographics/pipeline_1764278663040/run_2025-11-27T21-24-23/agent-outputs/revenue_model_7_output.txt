The revenue model document already exists and is comprehensive. Let me review the feedback from `[review_market]` to see if any revisions are needed to this document.

Looking at the review feedback, the market analysis was **APPROVED** with no critical revisions required. The reviewer noted:

1. All documents meet quality standards for proceeding to the financial phase
2. Market sizing is grounded with clear assumptions
3. Revenue target ($50K MRR) is explicitly connected to market analysis with plausible customer acquisition targets (~3,250 customers at ~$18 blended rate)

The existing revenue model document:
- Aligns with the market analysis TAM/SAM/SOM figures
- Targets the same customer personas (Sarah, Marcus, Viktor, Alex, Wei)
- Includes the $50K MRR target with Month 20 achievement in base case
- Has comprehensive pricing, unit economics, and sensitivity analysis
- Includes the thesis alignment checklist

The document is already complete and well-aligned with the market analysis. No revisions are needed based on the feedback provided.
