I've created the comprehensive product roadmap for MineBox at `business-plan/technical/02-product-roadmap.md`.

The document covers:

**Product Vision**: Mission statement focused on hobbyist mining sovereignty, core value proposition differentiating from DIY and node platforms, and 3-5 year vision from category definition through ecosystem leadership

**Feature Backlog**: 60+ features organized by area:
- Core Mining Infrastructure (stratum, daemons, multi-coin)
- Snapshot & Verification System (cryptographic proofs, federated verification)
- User Interface & Experience (dashboard, mobile, charts)
- Deployment & Operations (Pi image, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Notifications & Alerting (email, Telegram, webhooks)
- API & Integration (REST, CLI, plugins)
- Security & Compliance (audit, reproducible builds, 2FA)

**MVP Definition**: Bitcoin-only with snapshot sync, stratum server, web dashboard, and Pi image. Explicit exclusions and success criteria defined (< 30 min sync, > 80% setup completion, 100+ active users).

**Release Plan**: Four phases aligned with technical architecture:
- Phase 1 (Months 1-3): MVP with Bitcoin
- Phase 2 (Months 4-7): Multi-coin v0.5 and production v1.0
- Phase 3 (Months 8-10): v1.5 with notifications and analytics
- Phase 4 (Months 11-18): v2.0 platform with plugins and $50K MRR target

**Prioritization Framework**: Modified RICE with sovereignty alignment multiplier

**Product Metrics**: North Star metric (Active Mining Sessions per Week) with supporting acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, and revenue metrics

**Competitive Feature Comparison**: MineBox vs. Umbrel, DIY, and dead NOMP with differentiation timeline

**Dependencies & Risks**: External, technical, market timing, and regulatory risks with mitigation priority matrix
