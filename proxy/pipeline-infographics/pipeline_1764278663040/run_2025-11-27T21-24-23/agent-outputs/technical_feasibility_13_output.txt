I've created the comprehensive technical feasibility assessment for MineBox. The document covers:

**Feasibility Overview:**
- Overall confidence level of Medium-High (75%)
- Eight key technical assumptions with validation status
- Five critical success factors

**Technical Assumption Validation:**
- Detailed analysis of each assumption including Pi 5 memory capacity, sub-30-minute sync time, cryptographic verification trust, stratum latency, multi-daemon feasibility, USB-SSD I/O, community adoption, and altcoin RPC stability
- Each assumption includes validity assessment, supporting evidence, risk level, and mitigation strategies

**Technology Risk Assessment:**
- 10 identified risks with probability/impact ratings
- Risk categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Specific mitigation strategies and owners

**Team Capability Assessment:**
- Required skills matrix (10 skill areas)
- Skill gap analysis with acquisition strategies
- External expertise requirements (security auditor, cryptography consultant, etc.)

**Proof of Concept Status:**
- What's already validated vs. needs validation
- Four recommended POC activities with success criteria

**Technical Debt Considerations:**
- Expected MVP debt (8 items) with repayment timeline
- Long-term maintainability factors

**Scalability Assessment:**
- Capacity projections from MVP through v2.0
- Bottleneck identification
- Cost projections showing sustainable unit economics (infra at 2% of revenue at target)

**Recommendations:**
- Top 3 technical priorities
- De-risking activities with timeline
- **GO recommendation with conditions** including specific red flags that would flip to no-go
