I've created a comprehensive risk analysis document for MineBox. Here's a summary of what was analyzed:

## Risk Analysis Summary

**52 risks identified across 6 categories:**

### Top 10 Prioritized Risks:
1. **Snapshot Trust Rejection (Score: 20)** - Core value proposition risk; crypto purists may reject verified snapshots
2. **Key Person Dependency (Score: 20)** - Founder is single point of failure in Years 1-2
3. **Runway Exhaustion (Score: 15)** - Cash burns faster than projected before breakeven
4. **Pi 5 Memory Pressure (Score: 12)** - Multi-daemon may not work reliably on 4GB
5. **Churn Higher Than Projected (Score: 12)** - Monthly churn exceeds 5% target
6. **Revenue Concentration (Score: 12)** - Over-dependence on Bitaxe owner segment
7. **Crypto Bear Market (Score: 12)** - Extended downturn reduces mining enthusiasm
8. **Market Size Overestimation (Score: 12)** - TAM may be smaller than $10-25M
9. **Talent Retention (Score: 12)** - Key engineers leave with institutional knowledge
10. **Security Vulnerability (Score: 10)** - Exploitable bug damages trust

### Scenario Analysis:
- **Best Case (20%)**: $8.4M ARR Year 5, 32K customers, Month 10 breakeven
- **Base Case (60%)**: $4.1M ARR Year 5, 18K customers, Month 26-28 breakeven
- **Worst Case (20%)**: $1.0M ARR, survival mode, potential pivot or wind-down

### Key Mitigations Required:
1. Pre-launch community survey to validate snapshot acceptance
2. Aggressive documentation to reduce key person risk
3. Raise $300-400K (upper range) for runway buffer
4. Extensive Pi 5 POC testing before commitment
5. External security audit before v1.0 launch
